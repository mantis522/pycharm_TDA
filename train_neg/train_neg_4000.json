This cowardice and selfcensorship for the fear of offending anyone permeates the series, and is ultimately responsible for its failure.Robert Carlyle puts in a valiant performance as the most hated man of the twentieth century, but he is hamstrung by two things. The lack of a decent dialogue coach on the series leaves his NorthernUK heritage shining blindingly through his physical appearance, and the dialogue is at times truly abysmal. Apparently, acknowledging the fact that Hitler was raised in a Catholic family is off limits, but insulting millions of Vikings and their descendants by having Carlyle spew the most ridiculous lines about Valhalla is quite okay. Well, heres a clue for the writers  any person familiar with Viking mythology will tell you that Valhalla is about the embodiment of honour and might in battle, two things that the Nazis quickly eschewed in favour of rat cunning and backstabbing. Until we can wake up to ourselves and realise that the reason Hitler has never been excommunicated from the Catholic church is because it would require the embarassing acknowledgement that he was once a member, we will never learn what this awful period of the worlds history has to teach us.So now that we have managed to insult Vikings and the citizens of Scandinavian countries in this sham, you would think the series would stop there, but it does not. Stockard Channings listing in the opening credits was particularly eyebrowraising, given that her voice is heard, and her face seen, for about thirty seconds at the most during the opening credits, making it patently transparent that more footage of Hitlers early days were shot, but not included because of a typical nannystate fear of offending someone. It is also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far better insight into Hilters character do not feature him at all.Until we learn to stop sugarcoating the truth and realise that the citizenry of Germany was mostly unopposed to Hitlers views, and not necessarily through ignorance, we will never learn to deal with the fact that subversions of democracy yes, Germany was a democracy preHitler can occur anywhere, we are doomed. That is the one thing this miniseries got right in portraying. Unfortunately, that element is lost in attempts to make Hitlers religious beliefs appear those of a much more valiant people, and the inability to scratch past the surface in any part of the subject matter. David Lettermans show had it pegged when they ran short satirical segments about the series. They really might as well have made a family sitcom with him as the star, that is how badly it was written.All in all, this politically correct farce of a biopic is worth no points, but I gave it two because Robert Carlyle definitely deserves better material than this, and he is about the only thing in it that works.","label":0},{"index":3002,"txt":"This 1919 to 1933 Germany looks hardly like a post WWII Czech capitol.

Big mistake. The German language has a certain sound to it, and especially Hitler himself only sounds like Hitler when he is speakingyelling German.The way the story is told made me believe it was improvised on the spot, the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happened.Whether it is the English or the fact that I have already seen Der Untergang, everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous.","label":0},{"index":3004,"txt":"I have recently watched this movie twice, and I cannot seem to understand why the hll the makers made this pile of crap.

What I cannot understand is why they pictured Hitler as a 100 pure evil, mad, unreliable, mentally unstable freak. He was after all a very thoughtful, loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides, no doubt about that. But why in heavens name portray him in this way? All of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario, leaving nothing but a very propagandalike portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever. Yes, he threw Germany into the devastating 2nd World War. Yes, he was racist, and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war. All true. But again; why the hell did they plain LIE to the public? To warn us?I absolutely do not think this movie was a warning. The true danger of Hitler and the Nazis was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness. The fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every German alive not to mention Austrians and a LOT of other people makes it a warning to modern civilization, NOT the fact Hitler was such a weirdo. If it would have been like the makers make us believe  I would have been convinced that the German people were retarded.

A horrible joke of a film, I cringed throughout. Terrible, trite, distorted and riddled with outright lies and half truths.The famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw was to originally be a consultant for this film. However, he found the script to be so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused, and also demanded they stop using his name as a source it embarrassed him to think people would think he was involved.One scene shows Hitler beating his dog. There is not one source for this. Hitler loved animals above people. He brought in the strictest animal welfare laws in Europe, banned vivisection and animal experimentation. He was also a vegetarian.The film turns his gaining of the Iron Cross into a farce, involving bribery. Utter lies. He was awarded it for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of time.There are no historical documents showing that Hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece. Not one.Apart from these, Hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this garbage flick.If he was even half as ignorant, demented and thick as he is in this nonsense film as in real life you would not even know he had ever existed.

The title, The Rise to Evil, should tell you that this is not going to attempt to be anything deep or do much with Hitlers character. Rather, from the first minutes of the movie where we see baby Hitler looking evil with evil music playing the background, we are given a view of Hitler that presents his as a cartoony supervillian, seemingly ripped right out of a Saturday morning TV show. The film REALLY wants to make its case that Hitler was evil but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was evil? Ultimately, making him such a onedimensionally evil character is both boring and confusing one must ask how the inept, phsycotic character in the film cold ever persuade a nation to follow him or be named Times man of the year. This film had a great opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the most horrible acts in the 20th century, and try to delve into his mind. Instead, it basically just says, Hey! Hitler was evil! Just thought you might like to know... over and over again. The great irony is that the film still was attacked for presenting too sympathetic a view of the character.

Why try to paint the picture of Hitlers evil with colors that did not exist? He was evil alright, but now his character is portrayed in way that is often historically inaccurate compared to his love of animals, the gentle and subdued way he treated women and so on.The actors are good, so you must feel sorry for them as they are imprisoned inside their onedimensional characters.

Robert Carlyle is a wonderful actor, but to cast him as Hitler is just plain wrong. To cast Liev Schrieber as Hitlers longtime friend and aid, Haefengstal must have emitted cries of despair and anguish from the Simon Wiesenthal Centre. A JW playing a Nazi supporter, bad bad bad casting. This was not an enjoyable family film with a good historical background. This was Hollywood rubbish at its finest, cashing in on the strength of a strong but sorely under utilized supporting cast of actors whom seemed to have all but disappeared from the acting radar in the past 5 years.The fake German accents vee vill vin zis var is insulting to German people everywhere.

I will say this though; here is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the Valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school. You know, the ones with Batman exclaiming You are a super crimefighting valentine!Valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony, one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of Scream. The villain is omniscient and nighinvulnerable. The heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming HeyIjustleftmycoatbehind! The score is more overbearing than Norman Bates mother.The flimsy plot follows several childhood friends, now grown up and extremely curvaceous. Since the film gives them nothing else to do, they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one. This stalker appears to be former nerd Jeremy Melton, who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school. With Valentines Day approaching, the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom. Melton seems like the obvious suspect. Only problem is, as numerous characters warns, in thirteen years Melton could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome. So insert terrified gasp here everyone is a suspect!Heres problem one. In order to have any sense of suspense while watching Valentine, you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming David Boreanaz. Nerds do not turn into Angel when they grown up, they turn into older, balder nerds. He is not a terrible actor, but the script, by no less than four writers, gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out. Denise Richards the bustiest actress in Hollywood never to star in Baywatch is especially exploited; most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene. Note to self always bring a bathing suit to a Valentines Day party. Just because it is February does not mean you might not feel like taking a little dip.The slasher in Valentine dresses in headtotoe black with a Cherubs mask. Heres problem number two. The filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who is whacking people in the face with hot irons. Plain and simple, it is not. Instead, it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face, including his eyes and ears, can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables. Then again, given the things the Cupid Killer does, maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands. Not only is the movie bad, it is not even sure who the killer is; the final twist is more Huh? than Hah! When you are not scratching your head you are yawning, then groaning, then searching for the nearest exit. Do not watch this movie. Even if you are alone on Valentines Day, find something, ANYTHING, else to do. You will be glad you did.","label":0},{"index":3011,"txt":"If another Hitler ever arises, it will be thanks in part to nonsense like this film, which propagates the absurd notion that he was a visibly deranged lunatic from the start. Far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office in the land, sane people would cross the street to avoid him, and he would have died in a ditch, nameless and unknown.Anyone who reads the accounts of Hitlers close companions  the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge for instance  will be struck by the fact that people found him a kindly, intelligent, generous man. He was also a brilliant orator, and the fact that his speeches seem overblown and ranting to modern ears ignores the times in which they were made, when strutting pomposity was common in political speeches. Ditto the overstated antiSemitism, which was neither a central plank of the early Nazis  who were primarily anticommunist  nor uncommon or unusual for the times. The film makes it look as though Hitlers sole ambition from the start was the Holocaust.If you want to identify the next person who will cause the death of tens of millions, you can ignore flecklipped ravers life the one portrayed here. Look instead for a charming, charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation, and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country.

Another thing is It is too obvious, that Hitler is that evil, he was more clever, than shown in this movie. No German would have accepted him as the leader, because the can see that he is evil. So the real Hitler have not shown his evil side to the people.Have any of you Yankees watched the movie Der Untergang or The Dawnfall? this is a great movie, with amazing actors.

Despite what Mikshelt claims, this movie is not even close to being historically accurate. It starts badly and then it is all downhill from there. We have Hitlers father cursing his own bad luck on the fact that he would married his niece! They were in fact, second cousins. Hitlers mother, Klara, called his father, Alois, uncle because Alois had been adopted and raised by Klaras grandfather and brought up as his son, when he was really his nephew. Alois was much older than Klara and so as a child she would got into the habit of calling Alois, uncle.The scene in the trenches where Hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers. We see Hitler chase the dog through the trench, when he catches up with the poor thing he proceeds to thrash it for disobeying him. In the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and chastise the cowardly little man, but then a shell lands directly on his persecutors, and every last one, we are told, is killed outright. How then, if Hitler was the only person to survive the scene, did this tale of brutality and cowardice come to be told? Did Hitler himself go around boasting about it?  I do not think so.Next up, Hitler bullies and intimidates a poor, stressed out and war weary Jewish officer into giving him an Iron Cross! I can only assume that this Jewish officer had been a pawnbroker before fighting for the Fatherland, and had thoughtfully brought along some pledged medals from his shop, because I am certain that Iron Crosses were not being handed out as shown in this comic farce.All the grotesque clich\u00e9s are here, not least the calming and hypnotic effect of Wagners music upon the little man. If only the producers had kept Ian Kershaw on side. Then they might have discovered that Franz Lehars Merry Widow was more likely to float the Fuhrers boat than any Flying Dutchman from the cannon of Richard Wagner!Hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people but how can he ever be forgiven for his appalling taste in music?I could go on but I would be at it for hours.Give it a miss.","label":0},{"index":3014,"txt":"Just imagine the real Hitler, who was a master of propaganda and speech, would have been such a mumbling moron as Carlyle portrayed him in this film.Nobody would have followed him, not even a desperate, unemployed guy in the 1920s.This is just a Hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda itself, disguised as true history.I pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show.

Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have one of her admirers shot . Hitler turned up with a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm . Forgive me for asking but havent the writers confused Adolph Hitler with Tony Montana from SCARFACE ? Thats bad enough but what really offended me was that theres entire chunks of historical context missing in this mini series . Germany lost the first world war and the allied powers made Germany pay a heavy price for doing so. It was this economic environment that led the German people to have someone  anyone  to restore their pride and thats why they turned to Nazism . The German humiliation of the 1920s caused by the allied powers seems to be entirely missing therefore there is no way that HITLERTHE RISE OF EVIL can be taken seriously as a historical document, and I havent even mentioned that Himmler and Goering are conspicous by their absence There is one positive point about the mini series and thats Robert Carlyle in the title role . Okay some of his mannerisms are wrong and his voice is a little too loud  Archive recordings show that Hitler had a soft seductive voice  but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and he does manage to communicate Hitlers own charisma on screen . Comments in the British press that Carlyle resembles the synth player from Sparks more than Adolph Hitler are unfounded and he gives one of the better interpretations of Hitler.I liked the performance by Robert Carlyle but I hated everything else about this mini series and wondered why on earth it was made in the first place .

But this is however not the case here. Sure the movie is entertaining and all but the fact that it is not entirely based upon true facts is more than annoying. Hitler was not antisemitic in his youth, he even worked for Jews before world war one. It was however during world war one and after that he formed his views about the Jews. His upbringing in this movie is also inaccurate, Hitler as a child was not a disturbed little brat. He had a more or less normal upbringing. Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that adds to the puzzle that is Hitler.Robert Carlyle is a great actor but he does not really fit in the role as Hitler. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as he is portraited here. Under his younger years he was a charismatic person whom manipulated people through his charms. His unstable behavior and rage outbursts started in the turning point of the war.I would like to see a film about Hitlers life that is based upon real historical facts and not accusations. I really hate when people point a blaming finger at for example Hitler and others and tell inaccurate stories just to paint a picture of them as pure evil. It is much better to actually tell the story EXACTLY as it was so that everyone can learn what it was like! The ones behind this movie should have made some research before making this.

I can see why he quit.To quote some guy responsible for this rubbishThe Kershaw book was an academic piece, he said. It wasquite dry. We needed more incidents. Incidents? Are they totally nuts? Hitlers life cannot be said to be without incident  yes Kershaws two volume Hitler biographies were long and detailed, but they were supposed to be.The thesis behind Rise of Evil seems to beHitler was a very bad man  no he was a VERY bad man, who HATED jews, and just in case you miss this, we are going to emphasise the fact in EVERY scene in the film.There was no effort whatsoever to try and explain the mood of the time, and why Hitler may have adopted the views and strategy he did. Needless to say  unlike the generally excellent Nazis  A Warning from History  this film neglected to point out the fact that nearly all of the leaders of the Munich communist rising were Jewish, and that this may have coloured his views on the subject  and his axiomatic linking of the jews with Bolshevism  an absolutely crucial aspect to understanding much of the Nazi era.But there was not much understanding to be done  the filmmakers were not going to go there, so we just got all the stuff we knew about anyway. We certainly do not get the fascinating fact that Kershaw alludes to, which has Hitler briefly being a socialistcommunist immediately after WW1. That would of course be far too complex for the film to handle, and might even detract from the relentless he was very bad mantra which bangs away incessantly.We know he was a bad man. However, we also know that he was a mesmerising figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations. He could be polite and even sympathetic, and of course espoused some views like vegetarianism, antialcohol and antismoking that many Guardian readers could agree with. He was also famously fond of animals, hence why that wholly invented dogflogging scene was so absurd.He was also, from all the accounts I have seen, a brave soldier in WW1. Whilst we saw him with his Iron Cross, we never get to see how he won it acts of bravery were not in the script, needless to say. We also get no insight whatsoever into why he was so fired up by his war experiences, whilst Sassoon, Owen, Brook, Remarque and so many others found it so repellent an experience. And again, like the point above re the jewishbolshevik link, this is vital to anyones understanding about the subject. Why did he love war so much? Why did he think it was always a good idea, despite massive evidence to the contrary? Why did not he care about his colleagues who died? Or maybe he did  but still drew the wrong conclusions.This film certainly did not have anything of any interest to say on this either.As all too often these days, the film is a classic example of making history relevant to the present and inventing stuff or leaving awkward facts out to fit in with the present  which all too often is to cater to the lowest common denominator, where you do not trust your audience an inch, so you just ram stuff down their throats, knowing sadly correctly that you will always get away with it because there are so many dumb fools in the world.History is really about making us relevant to the past and seeing how it colours our present, for better and for worse.

The film is historically just too incorrect. The mistakes start right away when Hitlers father Alois dies at home, while in reality he died in a pub. In the film, Hitler moves from Vienna to Munich in 1914, while in reality he actually moved to Munich in 1913. I could go on endlessly. Hitlers childhood and youth are portrayed way too short, which makes it quite difficult for historically uninformed people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man. Important persons of the early time of the party, like Hitlers fatherly friend Dietrich Eckart or the party philosopher Alfred Rosenberg are totally missing. The characterization of Ernst Hanfstaengl is very problematic. In the film he is portrayed as a noble character who almost despises Hitler. The script obviously follows Hanfstaengls own gloss over view of himself which he gave in his biography after the war. In fact, Hanfstaengl was an antisemite and was crazy about his Fuehrer. But the biggest problem of the film is the portrayal of Hitler himself. He is characterized as someone who is constantly unfriendly,has neither charisma nor charm and constantly orders everybody around. After watching the film, one wonders, how such a disgusting person ever was able to get any followers. Since we all know, what an evil criminal Hitler was, naturally every scriptwriter is tempted to portray Hitler as totally disgusting and uncharismatic. But facts is, that in private he could be quite charming and entertaining. His comrades didnt follow him because he constantly yelled at them, but because they liked this strange man.

Isabelle Lucci, inconstant wife of venture capitalist Stewart Collins John OHurley, begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman Richard Davis Philip Casnoff, simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for Richard, apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent. When Davis becomes convinced that guileful Isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband, he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may wed her himself, coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimentary essay at hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent Stewart. In the wake of the hitmans assault upon Collins, a pair of police detectives, performed by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, become increasingly curious concerning Isabelles possible involvement in the crime, while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured Richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamoratas maneuvering. Lucci and Kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirators, each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds, but OHurley and McDermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elements. Released upon a Fremantle DVD, this largely lustreless affair depicting a man neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from topflight visual and sound quality, and although no extra features are provided, the aboveaverage production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards.","label":0},{"index":3026,"txt":"SPOILERS A bit ridicules made for TV movie has sexy and middle age golddigger Isabelle Collins, Susan Tucci,doing a number on every man she comes in contact with in the movie. First winning over their hearts then their wallets and then, when their no longer any use to her, thrown in the wastepaper basket like a used up Kleenex tissue.Isabelles first victim is non other then her abusive, on keeping Isabelle from raiding his bank account, husband Stewart, John OHurley. It is later in the movie when Isabelle gets very friendly with former plumber and now yacht salesman Richard Davis, Philip Casnoff, that she, without really telling him, has the totally lovesick Richard get a contract out on her unsuspecting husbands life. Getting this exconvict, in fact as soon as he is released from prison, Daggett, Nicholas Campbell, to do the job on Stewart Richard soon finds out that he did not get exactly what he paid, 15,000.00 in cash,for.Getting a little too greedy Daggett not only blew Stewarts brains out but took a solid gold watch, that Stewart offered him in order to spear his life, as well. The watch was easily traced to Daggett as he tried to pawn it at a local jewelry shop where he was quickly arrested. With Doggett spilling his guts out on who hired him to whack Stewart it does not take long for the long arm of the law to arrest Stewarts, by hiring Doggett, killer Isabelles husband to be explumber and yacht salesman Richard Davis! Davis arrest by the police happens just as he and Isabelle took the vows of matrimony in a local church!Isabelle manipulates everyone, exclusively men that fall head over heels for her, to her advantage by getting them to do her dirty work. Always playing the part of the naive housewife or widow or lover or even client Isabelle seems to live a charmed life always one step ahead of the law and police. No matter what she does Isabelle covers her pretty behind so well that it is almost impossible to pin her down on any, in having others do them, of the many crimes that she commits, through a second party, in the film.After screwing, figuratively as well as literally, her first husband Steven her second husband, for less then ten seconds, Richard and finally her, or Richards, attorney Gavin Kendrick, Kamar De Los Rey, Isabelle knows that it is only a matter of time before the police get wise to her. With the D.A getting both Richard and Kendrick to turn evidence against her Isabelle now knowing that everything is fast closing in on her makes her final move. Getting everything in order, by transferring all her cash overseas, Isabelle and her 10 yearold daughter Ruby, Lauren Collins, shoot down to the passport office in order to get clearance, passports, to get out of the country.It is then when the cagey and clever Isabelle makes her first and possibly last and fatal mistake in the movie. Isabelle is told by the passport clerk, Don Carrier, she will have to wait a full 48 hours for her, and Rubys, passport to clear! Just enough time for the police to find and arrest her! Outlandish ending that goes against almost everything and every ethic that is in a film noir or crime movie.

But this film, The Human Tornado aka Dolemite 2 will always hold a special place in my heart. For sheer goofiness, lack of skill in film production, and absolute enthusiasm frankly a little too much, The Human Tornado cannot be topped.The opening scene sets the tone. Our old pal Dolemite is shacking up with a white woman, when some racist local cops raid the house for no good reason, and would not you know it! The woman in bed with ol Dole is none other than the sheriffs wife. Her cry when she sees him He made me do it! Dolemites cry  are you for real??? Subtlety was never his strong point.Highlights? The cameo by a very young Ernie Hudson of Ghostbusters fame, the continuity errors characters looking one way in one shot, and another in the next, Dolemites suit changing colors in every single shot of his nightclub act, and Queen Bees demonic eyes in her first scene.But the real joy here is Rudy Ray Moore himself. Did the man really think he looked cool in this movie? I certainly do not know why, but you have to admire the sheer enthusiasm he has. Whether it be jumping totally naked off a cliff, or barking orders to his gang in rhyme e.g Quick! Into the cave! I have a plan to let that mother  dig his own grave! the man commits totally. Certainly he goes overboard, nevermore so than any time he is doing kung fu. The climactic battle is filmed at high speed, but occassionaly slows down to let Rudy pose and grits his teeth. I am not sure if they wanted it too look like they sped up the film as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe he was that fast. In any event, The Matrix it is not.Human Tornado, much like the original Dolemite, is an incompetent film of enormous proportions.

This flick STINKS. Now, I like at least in theory low budget horror movies, but this one makes the worst mistake a low budget flick can make It takes itself WAY too seriously. And, unfortunately, that is not it is only problem.It is the story of the murderous Beane clan of the British Ilses transposed to modern times. An interesting premise, but there are two things that are immediately perplexing about this film once you start watching it.1 Why is the biggest name on the CD box Jenna Jameson? She is a below average looking woman who cannot act, and she has a minor role. ANSWER She is apparently a well known porn star as you no doubt read in other reviews, so I guess this is a cameo appearance for her. She is giving the film much needed name recognition, it seems. Her top billing is not any indication of her talent, though, it is an indication of how UNtalented the rest of the cast is.2 How can film makers be so stupid to think Canada can be passed off as Ireland? It does not even remotely look like Ireland. And the house that the guestsvictims stay in is this great big North American wood frame Edwardian thing. They should have skipped the whole Beane theme and developed a story that took place in N.A. Also, if you are going to make a movie that takes place in Ireland, it is probably best to have more than one character with an Irish accent and that was a REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD Irish accent. Now,this would not have been so bad if the director was not trying to make the next Night of the Living Dead, but it seems he was. Too bad. He could have had some fun with it. In fact, some of the scenes were not far from being unintentionally comedic as they were.Like the infamous gutting scene, were the woman is chained to the table, stripped naked, and then sliced open and eviscerated. That is funny, you ask? Well, in the deleted scene version, the mutant killer pulls out mile after mile after mile of intestines. It is actually funny after awhile. And what self respecting cannibal eats intestines, anyway? Do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens? Heck no, we eat hams and ribs and drumsticks. Oh well.Some of the other cast who were annoying the whiny, creepy Howard Rosenstein. I am not sure, but I THINK he was supposed to be cast as a STUD. In fact, he is as big a loser and goof ball as his name would imply. Which would explain why the character played by the equally annoying Gillian Leigh fell for him.I checked Gillian Leigh on her link on IMDb, and apparently it is important to know that she graduated high school with honors. I cannot decide if it is more amusing or pathetic to know that only a couple years after graduation, the honor student is doing nude softcore porn scenes in a shower with a guy named Howard Rosenstein. Wonder if her former classmates have seen this movie? If they have, hopefully they will get the message AVOID THIS FATE! GO TO COLLEGE!!! I could go on and on, but why.

At least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you will laugh harder than you thought possible. This is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever. from the bad acting, to clich\u00e9 visual ie opening credits, to the adobe premier special effects. they could not even get blanks for the guns, which may have to do with where the movie was filmed, but if you are going to use effects, make them close to accurate. as for the cast, it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out. Once again, like Ron Hall in Vampire Assassin, do not let stunt folk act, they cannot. Also, the comment about this being a return of old vampire movies...no, it is not. This is exactly what all new vampire movies are about. Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Blade, Underworld, they are all about some super star fighting the vampires.

But no, this has got to be the most butchered modern horror film, I mean it is easy to tell there is much more to certain scenes, but they suddenly cut away, or the scene just totally ends right as it begins. How does one screw up cannibals and porn stars?

Straight up craptastic. Rather than rehash what may serve as a plot, I will run a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my head.A class of 5 take a field trip for a history class to the middle of friggin nowhere Ireland. These students may be Canadian or American, it is difficult to tell. That it was filmed in a Canadian forest rather than Ireland is rather obvious as well. One student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the dumb jock character from a number of kick ass 80s movie, except when he channels Randy from Scream. One character may be Chris Kleins stunt double. He has a girlfriend who probably gets killed, but it is never really established if that is true. One character is sullen and removed from her peers...just...cuz... and then there is a blonde girl. Yay blonde girl.Ireland has a population of 2. They are cousins. Gary, who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast, is called sir more than once. He is very ominous and wears a knit cap. His cousin is a roughed up porn star with the worst Irish accent to befoul film in my lifetime and most likely beyond.Picturesque Ireland features many Canadian forests and swampy areas and 2 ducks which appear more than once in cut scenes.The producers got a discount on volume fake entrails. Good for them.Unbeknownst to me, horribly inbred freaks have access to brand spanking new hunting knives. Perhaps there is some kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the register.Also unbeknownst to me, if you inbreed for roughly 600 years, as the story leads us to believe happened, you end up being somewhat lumpy, yet amazingly spry and fairly strong. Genetics are a wonderful game of craps.There may or may not be more than one freak in this film. Reference is made to them and we see shadows, yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever. And when one odd looking dude is finally killed, apparently all danger is passed. I am running with my initial assumption that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up, thus they just used the one. That is what it looks like on screen, anyway.Richard Grieco should be ashamed.Also of note, aside from those shiny new knives, the inbred freaks have access to some posh leather gear, as once Richard Grieco cuts his bonds, there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied up...who also then escapes, because the chains give you enough slack to just undo them, making one wonder why they even bother tying anyone up.A dead body in a shack will be maggotridden after what I would guess is about 2 hours has passed. Said dead body will also have glasses on, when no characters wore them. Curious.Jenna Jameson appears for no reason from stage left, chats for 2 minutes, vanishes stage left. In the middle of a giant forest. That is not unusual, as Gary can also pop out of nowhere, which is also known as whatever exists in TV land off the screen.Ms. Jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes vanish like my hopes that this movie would not suck wind.I offer a special nod to the Breeder character, the poor girl who has been used by the freaks for months or maybe years for breeding purposes. The poor girl who still has eye shadow on and emotes on camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua.The ending of this movie was clearly tacked on by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental disability that has been cultivated and encouraged with excessive gasoline drinking over the years.Apparently this was not just random crap I found on the movie network late at night, apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through it is production. How sad for you all. I have nothing more to say. May God have mercy on us all.","label":0},{"index":3053,"txt":"Tourists head to Ireland for a school trip to learn about Druids. What they encounter is a horrific tale of cannibalistic killers.If I had to sum up Evil Breed, it would be a low grade gore fest. The film mixes Dead Alive, Evil Dead, Wrong Turn all in one. It is just too bad that the film has so many inconsistencies to keep track of that it loses any fun one would have watching it. The film has lots of random horror nudity...although the film also stars four porn stars, yup four, so there could have been plenty more. Breed also showcases a good amount of gore. Evil Breed has a horrible start, with laughable dialogue and horrible acting. That is a given in a straight to video horror film, but this takes the cake. I cannot really figure out who the main character is, since the one female who lives at the end is not really in the movie all that much. Speaking of the ending, that has to be one of the most random and bogus ending in the history of film. It has no purpose with the rest of the film and totally changes ones view of the film.You have to see this film to believe it, since there are some pretty great death scenes. There are two death scenes that come into my mind, one in which the inbred killer rips the intestines out of a naked woman through her chest....yea her chest, do not ask me. The other id when the guy gets his intestines, yet again, ripped out through his asshole. Does that kill the guy? No, the killer continues to strangle the guy with his own intestines. These scenes remind me so much of DeadAlive, with the right amount of humour in each. I also got the sense of Evil Dead, with the pointless mentions of horror films and Sam Raimi. Along with Halloween, when the female character is in a closet screaming for her life with the killer trying desperately;y to get in.Although, the gore and nudity are not enough for the poor audio and visual quality of the film. When the teacher wakes up from her bed and walks down the stairs, her footsteps are so loud and hard that it seems like she was wearing boots. Distracting indeed. As well as the continuity in the film, with only one inbred killer? As well as which character dies at which moment. I could not tell if the breast implant chick was Jenny or Garys sistercousin...I cannot remember. As well as the random naked chick with a dead baby hanging out of her body, still attached with the umbilical cord.The horrible editing is distracting as well, the opening credits are too fast and disorienting. It did have a bad start and got better, but the ending just brings the film back down to a horrible level. If maybe there were better production values and more faith put into this film, then it would not have been horribly butchered to death. Stay away from this film, unless you are happy with the below budget horrible bad film with decent gore.","label":0},{"index":3054,"txt":"Well, you know the rest!

This movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts, however, even this cannot disguise the fact that the lady does not know how to throw a punch.

Infamous Director Demofilo Fidani, however, is rightly known for some of the cheapest, trashiest, and, well, worst contributions to the genre. The plots of Fidanis movies were usually very weak, and since his talent was quite limited, he usually tried to sell the movies by adding famous Spaghetti Western names like Django of Sartana to the titles. I the particular case of Gi\u00f9 La Testa... Hombre of 1971 he just took the title of Sergio Leones Gi\u00f9 La Testa aka. Duck You Sucker and added Hombre. The movie can be found under various titles Fistful Of Death, Western Story..., I personally bought it under the name Adios Companeros, which this movie shares with another Fidani film with almost the same cast, Per Una Bara Piena Di Dollari, which is also entitled Adios Companeros in the German language version.The plot is rather weak, it basically follows a guy named Macho Callaghan Jeff Cameron and his involvement with two rivaling outlaw gangs lead by Butch Cassidy Jack Betts and Ironhead Gordon Mitchell.The leading performance by Jeff Cameron is, kindly stated, not very convincing. Neither did I find Jack Betts very good as Butch Cassidy. Bmovie legend Gordon Mitchell, however, is always worth a try, and although he probably was not a very good actor, I always found his performances in the Spaghetti Westerns quite funny and original, and he actually saved some of Fidanis movies such as the rather crappy Django And Sartana... Showdown in the West.There is one very funny and original thing about Gi\u00f9 La Testa... Hombre  the great Klaus Kinski is playing a priest! I could have imagined Kinski in any role, but before seeing this movie I would never have guessed that anybody would cast him as a priest. Kinski is, once again, great, although he has only little screen time, and one scene, where he breaks up a fight, is probably the only good scene in this. One more interesting thing about this film is that the legendary director and king of sleaze Joe DAmato did the cinematography.Gi\u00f9 La Testa... Hombre is a cheap, crappy film, but nevertheless, it has some funny moments. Being a Spaghetti Western enthusiast, I found it fun to watch, but if you are not, never mind this movie, or watch it only for the purpose of seeing Kinski play a priest. 310","label":0},{"index":3061,"txt":"A quite usual trashy ItaloWestern, stupid storyline full of clich\u00e9s and lack of logic, some mediocre actors, dirty settings, lots of punchfights and people shoot dead on a massive scale.This has nothing to do with Django.

These were made for Mack Sennett also known as Keystone Studios and were literally churned out in very rapid succession. The short comedies had very little structure and were completely ad libbed. As a result, the films, though popular in their day, were just awful by todays standards. Many of them bear a strong similarity to home movies featuring obnoxious relatives mugging for the camera. Many others show the characters wander in front of the camera and do pretty much nothing. And, regardless of the outcome, Keystone sent them straight to theaters. My assumption is that all movies at this time must have been pretty bad, as the Keystone films with Chaplin were very successful.The Charlie Chaplin we know and love today only began to evolve later in Chaplins career with Keystone. By 1915, he signed a new lucrative contract with Essenay Studios and the films improved dramatically with Chaplin as director. However, at times these films were still very rough and not especially memorable. No, Chaplin as the cute Little Tramp was still evolving. In 1916, when he switched to Mutual Studios, his films once again improved and he became the more recognizable nice guyin many of the previous films he was just a jerk either getting drunk a lot, beating up women, provoking fights with innocent people, etc.. The final evolution of his Little Tramp to classic status occurred in the 1920s as a result of his fulllength films.It is interesting that this film is called TWENTY MINUTES OF LOVE since the film only lasts about 10 minutes! Oh well. The plot, what little there is, involves the Little Tramp in the park. A couple wants to neck but inexplicably, Charlie insists on practically sitting on the couples lap and really annoying them. I cannot understand why and the short consists of Charlie wandering about the park annoying these people and some others later in the film. Perhaps he was looking for a threesome, I do not know. But the film lacks coherence and just is not particularly funnyeven when people start slapping each other and pushing each other in the lake.

Disgusted with those he is responsible for overseeing. Disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does. Quite a change in character portrayal for Gere. But beyond him there is not much else. Some of the sets are okay dark and dangerous but there are so many other problems as to be laughable.I will be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films. But that suspension has limits. The biggest push against those limits is the destruction of EXTREMELY vital crime scenes. Someone as meticulous as Erroll would KNOW that moving a body would be a huge nono. Or trampling through a crime scene. Or moving evidence. It went beyond and hurt the film to no end.The other damaging part of this film is that we never get into Clair Danes character, Allison. She is almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and we are never privy to what her intension might be Will she stay or leave? Will she end up like Erroll if she does stay? This is not a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground, but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up.","label":0},{"index":3074,"txt":"In the title I write that the story is ludicrous. below I will elaborate and tell you why it, in my humble opinion, ruins this movie.Gere and Danes are doing their jobs, and while it is not their best work, it is quite OK. The rest of the cast, though, is doing a really poor job. Mind you, this is not entirely the actors fault. The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones that have characters that have even the slightest room in the movie to really give any depth. All other characters have either too little room in the movie to create any depth, or the character is such a clich\u00e9 that it does not matter how hard the actors try.The director has a bit of a Se7en complex, but looking merely at the direction, I think he does an OK job.But the story. This is the kind of script that is bad in two ways. First of all it is a bad movie script. The characters are shallow except for Geres and Danes characters, the villains are clich\u00e9s and the actions of the characters is totally unbelievable. Besides this, the writers must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics a hundred years. It is the kind of movie that are saying that some criminals are still criminals, regardless of the fact that they have paid the price the society has given them. It is also the kind of movie that says, albeit only between the lines, that every form of sexual deviance should be punished without trial, judge or jury. And of course, according to the movie, everything that is not sex in the missionary position by a married couple is a sexual deviance.So, if you are going to film school and need an example of a bad script, or if you are writing scripts yourself and want an ego boost. See it. For everyone else, I recommend another movie.","label":0},{"index":3075,"txt":"it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing.

The way Spielberg directs this is so contrived, so meddlesome.

Sentimentality is sugary and unreal, a false view of life. This is overthetop sentimentality.

Nothing rings true. I even wondered if Harpos name was chosen purposefully because it is his wife Sophias real name, Oprah, backwards.

And at this point, you know you have just been jerked around.People are generally trusting enough to assume that if something has been put on DVD, it is going to be of a certain level  at least financially if not creatively. But sadly this is not the case. Distribution companies are perfectly happy to throw together DVDs of amateur movies and ship them right out into the stores to await the unsuspecting buyer who is drawn in by the welldesigned DVD cover. The weight behind this particular project is most likely independent horror movie pioneer Kevin J Lindenmuth, whose name may be known amongst genre fans since he is responsible for various other lowbudget werewolf movies  Rage of the Werewolf, Werewolf Tales and so on.Blood of the Werewolf is made up of three short independent werewolf stories with no real connection other than the fact that they deal with hereditary shapeshifters. The first segment, Blood Reunion, pretty much sets the tone for the whole thing ... a man returns to his home town to look up a girl who had a crush on, only to find that her domineering grandmother refuses to let her have relationships with men, and for reasons which are somehow related to a dark family secret. This instalment is poorly directed, poorly directed, and basically nothing superior to what you could throw together yourself with a few friends and a home video camera.The second story, Old Blood, is probably the strongest out of the three and is directed by Lindenmuth himself. It tells the story of a lesbian couple, one of whom is a shapeshifter and the other wishes to be given this power. Her wish is granted, but she does not become the creature that she envisioned. This short movie shows that Lindemuth has more talent and experience than the other filmmakers who worked on this project, but still not enough to raise it above the level of an amateur movie.And finally we have Manbeast, in which some army guy runs through the woods while being chased by two other fellas. They wish to kill him as he has been bitten by the beast and is believed to be dangerous, but all might not be as it seems. This one has an interesting concept, but it is stretched out to be far too long, and if you do not guess what the twist is in the first ten minutes then you probably as not too bright.

What was needed was someone with vision enough to pull together the positive elements by reworking the script into some kind of coherent whole, instead of the sprawling, awkward mess that it is, try to figure out the motivations and interplay if you can. Also, a bigger budget could have matched up contrasting location and studio shots, and gotten the locations out of the alltooobvious LA outskirts.

Lucius ShepardThe Color Purple takes place in the Deep South during the early 1900s, and tells the story of Celie and Nettie, two African American sisters. The film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers, an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather. This motif \u0096 innocence interrupted by men \u0096 permeates the entire film.The film then launches into a series of short sequences. Celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather, gives birth in a dirty barn, has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named Albert Johnson, a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly, forcing her to cook, clean and look after his children.All these horrific scenes are given little screen time, and are instead surrounded by moments of pixiedust cinematography, a meddlesome symphonic score, incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work. The cumulative effect is like the merging of a Disney cartoon and a rape movie, a jarring aesthetic which caused Stanley Kubrick to remark that The Color Purple made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes. Ten minutes? He lasted a long time.The film is often said to deal which racism, sexism and black culture, but this is not true. Alice Walker, the author of the novel upon which the film is based, claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian. Her book is a lesbian fantasy, a story of female liberation and selfdiscovery, which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women. For Walker, the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia, black sisterhood and female independence celebrated.Spielbergs film, however, reframes Walkers story through the lens of comforting American mythologies. This is a film in which the salvific power of Christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men. A film in which Albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations, moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool. A film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows, the cast comprised of lecherous men always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins, stereotypical fat mammies, jazz bands and gospel choirs. This is a film in which black people are naturally childlike, readily and happily accepting their social conditions. A film in which black people are oversexed, carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions. A film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible Albert lives in a huge house and black men are completely inept. This is not the Old South, this is the Old South as derived from Gone With The Wind, MGM Muscals, Song of the South, Warner Cartoons, Halleluha! and banned Disney movies. In other words, it is the South as seen by a child raised on 50s TV. It is all so cartoonish, so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes, that black novelist Ishmael Reed famously likened it to a Nazi conspiracy.Of course, in typical Spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed. This reconciliation was in Walkers novel, but Spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin.Beyond Walkers hate letter to black men and Spielbergs bizarre caricaturing of black life, we are shown nothing of the black community. We have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community. Instead, Spielbergs camera jumps about, desperately fighting for our attention one of Celies kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a Home Alone movie, every emotion over played, the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by. Couple this with Quincy Jones ridiculously white music, and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history an angry feminist tract filmed by a white Jew in the style of Disney and Griffith, scored by a black man trying to emulate John Williams.Problematic too is the lack of white characters. Consider this the men in this film are not portrayed as being rough to each other, nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood. No, they are cruel by nature. And the women, whether quietly suffering like Celie or rebellious and tough like her sister, persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them. A better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed, rather, it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse, that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles and that African American domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors, women unable to support themselves and their children alone.And so there is a hidden ideology at work here. Late in the film one character tells another that since he did not respect his wife, she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites. The implication is that blacks need to return to their African roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them. ie Respect one another in your poor minority community and you will not run afoul of the dominant white culture. 310  A failure to confront sex and lesbianism, inappropriate musical numbers, countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz, incongruous comic business, emphatic music cues, and wildly hyped emotionality, all contribute to rendering The Color Purple worthless.","label":0},{"index":3100,"txt":"being a NI supporter, it is hard to objectively review a movie glorifying ulster nationalists. characters who are hard to root for, typical heavyhanded antiviolence messages, and a predictable poetic justice ending makes this an awkward watch...","label":0},{"index":3101,"txt":"I disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the British.

Karyn Parsons, who is famous for playing Hillary on Fresh Prince of Bel Air, works with him on the show and has a secret crush on Leon. The movie just piles on one boring subplot after another. And the gags are boring as well. The first time we see Leon mention the word wang it is pretty funny. When he uses it over and over again, supposedly trying to get a laugh, the joke has run dry. Most of the jokes he uses in the film are jokes we heard before, and done better, on the SNL sketch and played out tediously for a whole hour and twentyfive minutes. They even try to insert a musical number by Will Ferrell and his gang of Ladies Man haters, who all want to destroy him because their wives had an affair with him, to bring some life into this witless comedy. Ferrell has some funny moments, and tries to make the best out of an otherwise unfunny role. Ferrell just has that unique comic talent, and he is funny at almost anything he does. Even Julianne Moore gets a cameo. Watching her, you cannot but wonder What the hell is an Oscarwinning actress doing in this movie??!!!! Her name was not mentioned in the opening creditsprobably by her consent. And of course a movie of this theme has to include the Master of Love himself, Billy Dee Williams. Billy Dee is charismatic as always, but even he cannot breathe enough life into this film. I also have to add that the soundtrack is full of soft R  B hits, which impairs the film even more, giving it a horribly downbeat toneas if the script is not boring enough. I mean, this is supposed to be a comedy. The soundtrack would have been appropriate for something like Love Jones. The Ladies Man only has sporadic laughs. There are exceptions in which SNL can produce a great movie out of a short sketch. Watch both of the Waynes World movies, and you will see how it is done. But this movie, just like adapting Mary Catherine Gallaghers character to screen in Superstar, shows the flip side. Some sketches are meant to be remembered on SNL, and not on the silver screen.My score 3 out of 10","label":0},{"index":3106,"txt":"I rented this movie for a few laughs. I had never seen the SNL skit, but with hits like Tommy Boy, and Waynes World, it could not have been that bad, could it? The answer it was.

It is antifunny.I do not think I laughed harder than a chuckle at anything in this movie. It is simply unfunny. It is boring, stupid, inane, annoying, mindbogglingly bad, but not funny. I do not particularly care for Tim Meadows, or this character from SNL, but I expected better than this.The movie is completely lacking logic or common sense. It is like the script writer had a bag over his head while he was typing and he could not see which keys he was hitting. They tell the origin of the Ladies Man, but fail to include a motivation for his bizarre fascination with acting like it is still the seventies. The movie tries to get humor out of a man who appears to pleasuring himself to porn, shortly after he tried to hang himself. This is comedy? I like to consider myself having a pretty keen sense of humor Spending a lot of time writing comedy as I do, but maybe I am just not quite bright enough for this film.Lee Evans, so funny as Tucker in There is Something About Mary, is outrageously bad here. I was pleading with him in my head to shut up.By the end I was pounding on my chair, muttering under my breath, and had the film gone on any longer, would probably have attempted suicide.

Trying to make feature films out of skits that wore out their welcome the third time the were done on SNL makes no sense.I personally like Tim Meadows, and think that he would be great in the right movie. It is a shame to see a talented guy wasted in a film that features unfunny after unfunny situation, and caps it all with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene.

They actually went on and made another cheap exploitationer featuring hundreds of lusty bimbos, just to make this look even better. For the two Barbarian Brothers, they sure know how to make weird noises than becoming brave warriors so strong and bold enough to save their native land.

He is supposed to be menacing but he comes across as a buffoon. And it is funny to see Eva LaRue Callahan, one of the stars of ALL MY CHILDREN, appear in her first movie, walking around in skimpy fur bikini. I am sure she wants this dreck to disappear from the face of the earth! The socalled Barbarian twins are okay as the muscle bound heroes but it is almost impossible to construct a proper critique of their acting because their roles are, like everything else in this mess, really illconceived. The only way the film tries to differentiate one twin from the other is by having one twin wear a loincloth that covers his ass, while the other twins loincloth barely covers his muscular butt. I am not kidding! Do not ask me who is who though.Deodato must have been really desperate to agree to make this film. And his desperation is reflected perfectly in this trashy flick.

This is NOT what the book said at all. I know that books cannot be put on screen literally, but this did not even have ties to the book. Stephen King should have openly denounced any affiliation with the film and he should have forbidden using the title The Running Man for this shameless waste of film. I do not say it often, but this film was BAD. If I were not at home watching, I would have tossed rotten tomatoes at the screen. Once again bad.Note that I used someone a lot.

He escapes, but after a short while he is caught once again. This time ends up in a freakish reality show in which he is supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes, and eventually die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know that he is tougher than even the toughest of tough guys.I really wanted to like this movie, being an Arniefan and all. However, The Running Man contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me. E.g. The reconstruction of Arnies fight inside the helicopter, where the shocked audience is showed a short summary of the incident, complete with 510 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras filming the crew members, one of which _inside_ the eye of one of the crew members Arnie beats.There are other flaws also, and the plot, which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative, works for a while, then it sort of creates a pool of stupidness and unrealism in which it drowns.The acting cannot really be said to be anything better than sub par, with Arnie in the leading role, doing an average Arnie performance.

After so much hype about Joel Silvers Midas Touch with action flicks, he might want to make sure he bones up on his alchemy.First, the only redeeming value of the entire film was Billy Zane, and even he could not lift the slipshod writing out of the crapper. Having said that, Zanes performance falters about 2 3rds of the way through, as he does not even seem to know what else to do other than look smug. Cannot blame him here, though. The writing, quite frankly, sucked. Let us take ideas from Rat Race, Enemy of the State, Terminator, Midnight Run and any bad gambling film you can think of and simply rehash it. And who is brilliant idea was it to have TWO bridge chase sequences in a ROW?Sean Carrigan, the man of the hour of The Next Action Star shows all of the strengths and weaknesses the casting directors mention during the entire run of the series. A onenote johnny, Sean plays the dumb good looking jock very well, but struggles with shouldering the weight of the film. Quite frankly, we never quite seem to care about whether he lives or dies by about midway through, as Carrigan fails to provide a reason for the audience to even like him. His dumbbutlucky routine gets old as there really is not anything about the character to root for.But Carrigan is a dream compared to the wooden, rigid Corinne Van Ryck de Groot. Did Howard Fine really tell her to pretend to be a Terminator for the first half of the film? I do not think so. I kept expecting her to quote Arnie. Her character performance can be compared only to the dramatic depths of Freddy Got Fingered, though not nearly as welldeveloped. The camera loves her in dark, shadowy limousines, but in the harsh light of day her demeanor sucks all energy off the screen. Jeanne Bauer showed more natural life in her five minute bit part than Corinne showed at any part of her screen time.Ultimately, Sean has the rugged good looks to provide a good lead in an ensemble cast, but should not have been left to do this one solo. It was simply too big of a task for him. Next Action Star colleague Jared Elliot may or may not have had better luck with some more dynamic characterization, but it is hard to tell given Jeff Welchs lame script. Someone should take Welchs iMac away from him before he hurts himself or anyone else.

Melodrama and sentiment are dominant, and they are not the honest sort, to say the least. For example, just to keep things moving, this hospital has a psycho ward next door to the maternity ward, and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander about stealing babies.There are just enough laughs and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a Warners film, mostly from Glenda Farrell, who swigs gin from her hotwater bottle while she waits to have twins that, to her chagrin, she finds there is now a law against selling.

The name Hitokiri, a historical term, refers to a group of four superswordsmen who carried out numerous assassinations of key figures in the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate in the mid1800s under the orders of Takechi, the leader of the Loyalist i.e. ultranationalist, proEmperor faction of the Tosa clan. What was this struggle about? Sad to say, you will not find out in this film. Brilliant History Lesson indeed!No, Gosha is much more interested in showing you the usual bloody slicing and dicing and at absurd length the inner torment of the notverybright killer Izo Okada than in revealing actual history. Sakamoto, for example, was someone of historical significance, considered to be the father of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The closest Gosha comes to providing a history lesson is the scene in which Sakamoto, whom Takechi considers a traitor to the Loyalist cause, comes to Takechis mansion to try to sway him ideologically. He begins by talking about the international political situation, with foreign warships in Japans ports and a Japan that is too weak militarily to defend against them. Want to know more? Sorry. Gosha cuts off this potentially fascinating lecture in mid sentence!. So much for informing his audience about a turning point in Japanese history.The film left me in utter confusion about the aims of the two sides in this struggle. For the two and a half centuries that the Shogunate held central power in Japan, it was an institution dedicated to preventing social change, to preserving the feudal relations of society. It was fearful of outside contamination, both ideological and technological. In keeping with this spirit, it outlawed firearms, those instruments of leveling in Europe and the Americas, with which a peasant could have stood up to a samurai. Throughout this period, the Emperor was nothing more than a spiritual figurehead.But, in the towns, which stood in neutral zones between the feudal fiefdoms, a new class of merchants, landlords and craftsmen was developing  the class known in Europe by its French name, the bourgeoisie. Inevitably, as this new class gained strength, it chafed against the many confines of feudal society. As in Europe, the king Emperor became the central figure in the bourgeoisies struggle for power against the feudal aristocracy. But a political leadership does not always fully understand the interests of the class it serves. When the outside world arrived with a bang in 1853, in the form of U.S. Admiral Perrys Black Ships, the ruling elite of Japan was thrown into a crisis. Their military was no match for these foreigners. Also, they had heard about the havoc the British and French imperialists were wreaking in China. What should Japan do to save itself from the fate of its weak neighbor? Surprisingly, some elements within the usually isolationist Shogunate were inclined to open trade with the foreigners in order to obtain some of their advanced technology. This is the point of view represented just barely in the film by Sakamoto. On the other hand, the Emperorloyal ultranationalists, represented by Takechi, believed they could keep out the foreigners by force, if only they could prevent the other faction from selling out the country. Sound familiar? Thus, the assassination of key Shogunate figures is in order  and away we go.Takechis motivations were, for me, the films biggest puzzle. Gosha suggests that he is fighting mainly for his personal advancement rather than for the Loyalist cause. Can we take this to represent the tenor of the Loyalists as a whole? Do you care?Several reviewers have compared this film favorably with Goyokin, which Gosha made in the same year. But, where Goyokin is a crackling, suspenseful, adventure yarn, with a hero worthy of sympathy, Hitokiri is plodding, nowhere near as compelling and lacks such a hero. Sakamoto could have been this films hero but we are not allowed to know him  nor what he stands for  well enough for him to achieve that status.In view of his wonderful scores for five previous Kurosawa films, Masaru Satos score here was very disappointing, sounding like something rejected from a Bonanza episode.Barry Freed","label":0},{"index":3159,"txt":"Wow.

In the later scene we see a full regiment with drum and bagpipes marching into an ambush. In the British army, a sergeant does not order up a rescue attempt, and if you get past that, he does not attempt it with only one other soldier and an Indian servant when there is a full regiment on hand. The Indian insurgents are so incredibly inept it is laughable...there are hundreds of them but they cannot hold their prisoner or kill the two rescuers, of course not. At one point we see the British soldiers throwing blocks of stone down from the battlements at the insurgents, who are scattered around the mountainside in ambush...one would have to have an eggplant for a brain to think this would do any damage. After Cary Grant as the rescued prisoner is shot, he lies on the floor looking around at the water boy...hardly the actions of someone who has been shot in the back.

They cannot explain why the chopper of the political police was the only one authorised to fly over Caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers that were all over the roofs of the buildings nearby the presidential palace, something that would exhibit how inefficient would be the security measures to guard the President. A few days after the coup, the chief of the military guard in charge was asked at the National Assembly our Congress why did not they act against the snipers and he said ecause they were not there to act against the president, is not that a confession?There is so much more, the fact that the highest rank military announced that Ch\u00e1vez had resigned and 2 days later he said he had lied because that is politics and nowadays is the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ch\u00e1vez administration.It would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies depicted in this documentary, made with the intention of selling the world an image of the good old Hugo Ch\u00e1vez who rules for the poor and the bad rich opposition that wants him out at all costs, when the truth is that 6070 of people rejects his government, and that percentage includes the poor.I hope those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see a different version that is being made by a group of venezuelan people showing no less than 30 lies.Nazi propaganda has returned!","label":0},{"index":3175,"txt":"48 out of 278 people found this comment useful, and counting...People are such suckers for image and looks  as much as for the intellectually hollow idealism that lurks behind Communism. Che is charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by Leftist propaganda such as this movie about him.I do not know what is worse being captured by one of Che is murdersquads or having to sit through 4 hours of this typically Soderberghian garbage. The question is not why this petproject was made but what took them so long. By them I am referring, of course, to Leftwing Hollywood and its secret love of Marxist tyrants Lenin, Castro... take your pick. I am fascinated that it took decades for one of Tinseltowns least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project. Where was Oliver Stone all these years? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Barbra Streisand even? It is a mystery. All these overrated artists have often indulging themselves in similar, politically onesided projects, yet somehow Che Guevara, who is arguably the most popular and wellknown Communist, has not been a film topic of theirs yet.Guerrilla has all the hallmarks of an American truthbending story of an epic scale; there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar Hollywood bigbudget political fairytale bios such as Malcolm X or Gandhi, i.e. almost none. The movie stars Del Toro as the famous Argentinian revolutionary. Nevertheless, however controversial and criminal this mans actions may have been, one thing nobody could take away from him he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family  which is why Del Toro fits the bill only visually. Del Toro may be an interesting, charismatic actor and he may resemble Guevara physically, but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever, hence he makes Guevara come off as too primitive. Casting such mediocrities as Bratt, Philips and Franka Incompetente only underlines the directors lack of sound judgment.The movie is to the most part extremely slow no surprise there, and visually uninteresting. Even a director as brilliant as Kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3hour mark, so it is quite telling that this Soderbergh, who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career, would think that His Oceanic Grandness was up to the task. If you think the films length indicates that a bulk of Che is life has been shown here  then think again. Soderbergh focuses on Che is last phase, and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense, full of Guevaras alleged idealism. Psychopaths do not have ideals. I do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of Che is earlier life. Did he actually consider it too uninteresting? A massacre of 600 people holds no interest for the viewer, huh? Amazing. Some much better directors than this overpraised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a 4hour movie.Soderbergh, in a sense, becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative, dark side  which is more than 90  of Guevara. By spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy, consciously ignoring the ugly truth God forbid he should taint the holy image of Che, Soderbergh proves himself not a humanist  a fake image which most Hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold  but the opposite that he cares only about ideas, never about the people on whom these ideas are tested like on guinea pigs. Soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind; such people often have a latent contempt for the proleteriat what a stupid term they are supposedly siding with.Half of all students around the world wear Che is image on their red and orange shirts, but without ever knowing why. He has become an iconic figure for clueless, uninformed, very often young people, who think that by having this mans face on their chest that somehow makes them appear edgy, intellectual, hip or interesting. In reality, wearing a Che shirt only underlines ones overall shallowness and total disinterest in selfeducation. Would not YOU want to find out more about a person before you start advertising hisher face to the world? Wearing Che is bynow clich\u00e9 image has become as common as having a Bart Simpson coffee cup. All those Chewearers probably know more about Marges blue hair than they will ever read up on about Fidel Castros dead ally.After everything that would been done in the name of Marx, one would think that these mongrel ideals would be finally laid to rest. It seems mankind will never learn. Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Pol Pot, Castro, Milosevic, Ceausescu, the Iron Curtain, a hundred million dead, more than a billion ruined physically andor mentally through this system... so none of that matters, huh? The fact that Del Toro won a Cannes Award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless as to how Cannes and other European festivals work  and vote.

It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded.When I realized this was supposed to be an epic I never knew anything but the title before it started, I naturally thought of the greatest epic of them all, David Leans Lawrence of Arabia. More of that later.Not to be a racist, but aside from what I have already mentioned is the fact that there are too many characters who are, well, indistinguishable  unknown Hispanic actors who look alike, especially considering they all wear Che beards and all wear Che fatigues. This results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than Che, Benicio del Toro even Fidel has a very minor role. While del Toros terrific, think of Lawrence with Peter OToole as the only discernible character no Alec Guinness, no Omar Sharif, no Anthony Quinn, etc. You get the idea.Because the other characters are interchangeable, this results in a loss of reference. When top aides of Che are killed, you feel no remorse since you do not know who they are. Even when Che is killed I do not think that is a spoiler, there is no empathy from the audience  he is just killed.He is too onedimensional to relate to as a human being. Aside from being a revolutionary and second only to Jesus in moral rectitude, the only thing we learn about Che is that he is married with five children he tells another character that near the end. What was his motivation? A complete enigma.Maybe Soderbergh is purposely aping Lean. Like Soderberghs Che, Lean never lets us know anything about Lawrence, the mystery man of Arabia. But at least Lawrence had a friend Sharif and associates Guinness, Quinn. He was as courageous as he was insecure  i.e., had human qualities. Che is like a machine, about as warm as The Terminator.Earlier this year there was another war epic, Mongol.

For a film about 2 very charismatic menCastro and Che, engaged in a gargantuan political struggle, it is almost totally devoid of emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir who is at best a second level actor,with a slightly high pitched voice have no drama or depth and basically come down to Castro telling Che go here, go there, do this and that, with no explanation as to what effect or use this action will result in. Odder still is there is an actor in the cast who has the requisite power to play CastroJoaquim de Almeida, but he is shunted aside in a minor part in the second half. Without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers, the film becomes a dullish epiclength film about hairy, bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose or end. Several of the reviews I have read showered praise on the work of director Steven Soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely. One in fact spent more time talking about Soderberghs new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it is entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.This is an odd, odd thing to do since a Soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and b it is no more than a competent job of work, with an unremarked upon nod to Oliver Stones JFK in the black and white cut up camerawork when Che visits New York.

Strange, after 20odd years in the business. He was probably never much good at narrative, just hid it well inside edgy projects.None of this excuses him this present, almost diabolical failure. As David Stratton warns, two parts of Che do not even make a whole. Epic biopic in name only, Che2008 barely qualifies as a feature film! It certainly has no legs, inasmuch as except for its uncharacteristic ultimate resolution forced upon it by history, Soderberghs 4.5hrslong dirge just goes nowhere.Even Margaret Pomeranz, the more forgiving of Australias At The Movies duo, noted about Soderberghs repetitious waste of HD digital storage you are in the woods...you are in the woods...you are in the woods.... I too am surprised Soderbergh did not give us another 2.5hrs of THAT somewhere between his existing two Parts, because he still left out massive chunks of Che is revolutionary life! For a biopic of an important but infamous historical figure, Soderbergh unaccountably alienates, if not deliberately insults, his audiences by1. never providing most of Che is story; 2. imposing unreasonable film lengths with mere dullard repetition; 3. ignoring both true hindsight and a narrative of events; 4. barely developing an idea, or a character; 5. remaining claustrophobically episodic; 6. ignoring proper context for sceneswhatever we do get is mired in disruptive timeshifts; 7. linguistically dislocating all audiences even Spanishspeakers will be confused by the incongruous expositions in English; and 8. pointlessly whitewashing his main subject into one dimension. Why, at THIS late stage? The Tshirt franchise has been a success! Our sense of claustrophobia is surely due to Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen basing their screenplay solely on Guevaras memoirs. So, like a poor student who has read only ONE of his allotted texts for his assignment, Soderberghs product is exceedingly limited in perspective.The audience is held captive within the same constrained knowledge, scenery and circumstances of the revolutionaries, but that does not elicit our sympathy. Instead, it dawns on us that Ah, Soderberghs trying to hobble his audiences the same as the Latino peasants were at the time. But these are the SAME illiterate Latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies. Why does Soderbergh feel the need to equate us with them, and keep us equally mentally captive? Such audience straitjacketing must have a purpose.Part2 is more chronological than Part1, but it is literally mindnumbing with its repetitive bushbashing, misery of outlook, and lack of variety or character arcs. DelToros Che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to educate his own illdisciplined troops. The only letup is the humour as Che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant revolutionaries, some of whom violently lack selfcontrol around local peasants or food. We certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions, nor any strategic analyses of their guerrilla insurgency, such as it was.Part2s excruciating countdown remains fearfully episodic again, nothing is telegraphed or contextualized. Thus even the scenes with Fidel Castro Demi\u00e1n Bichir are unexpected and disconcerting. Any selected events are portrayed minimally and Latinocentrically, with Part1s interviews replaced by timeshifting meetings between the corrupt Bolivian president Joaquim de Almeida and US Government officials promising CIA intervention!.The rest of Part2s woods and dayfornight blue filter just exasperate the audience until they are eyeing the exits.Perhaps DelToro felt too keenly the frustration of many nonAmerican Latinos about never getting a truthful, unspun history of Che is exploits within their own countries. When foreign governments still will not deliver a free press to their peoplefor whatever reasonthen one can see how a popular American indie producer might set out to entice the notsowellread I may not be able to read or write, but I am NOT illiterate!cf.The Inspector General1949 out to their own local cinemas. The films obvious neglects and gross oversimplifications hint very strongly that it is aiming only at the comprehensions of the lessinformed WHO STILL SPEAK LITTLE English. If they did, they would have read tomes on the subject already, and critiqued the relevant social issues amongst themselveslearning the lessons of history as they should.Such insights are precisely what societies still needand not just the remaining illiterate Latinos of Central and South Americayet it is what Che2008 gleefully fails to deliver. Soderbergh buries his lead because he is weak on narrative. I am gobsmacked why Benicio DelToro deliberately chose Soderbergh for this project if he knew this. It is been 44yrs, hindsight about Guevara was sorely wanted it is what I went to see this film for, but the director diabolically robs us of that.David Stratton, writing in The Australian 03Oct2009 observed that while Part1 was uneven, Part2 actually goes rapidly downhill from there, charting Che is final campaign in Bolivia in excruciating detail, which ...feels almost unbearably slow and turgid.CheThe Guerilla aka Part2 is certainly no travelogue for Bolivia, painting it a picture of misery and atavism. The entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour, and the dramaticyet tragiccapture and execution of the films subject.The rest of this interminable cinema verite is just confusing, irritating miseryshockingly, for a Soderbergh film, to be avoided at all costs. It is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a smattering about the subject.210","label":0},{"index":3182,"txt":"The second half of Steven Soderberghs revolutionary bio on Che Guevara deals with his last campaign to export revolution to Bolivia. In order to maintain his saintly visage of Che Soderbergh conveniently leap frogs the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in Cuba and the folly of his Congo adventure This is the history of a failure he writes in the preface of his Congo Journal to concentrate fully on Che is attempt to rally support to rise up against the government in Bolivia. It would turn out to be a disaster and Guevaras final act.What plagued the first chapter follows suit here as Soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the beatific countenance of the contemplative Guevara once again being played like James Dean in East of Eden by Bernicio Del Toro. The problem is Guevara has little success in gaining converts and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades being swallowed up in the heart of darkness Bolivian Jungle. Unlike Werner Herzog in the magnificent, Aguirre, the Wrath of God Soderbergh fails to utilize the jungles metaphorical possibilities to heighten the desperation of the guerrillas. He seems more concerned with keeping Che is nimbus above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead enders. There is one Herzogian moment where Che sits astride an obstinate horse kicking and screaming to get it moving but overall Soderberghs mise en scene remains flat, sloppy and uninteresting. In both of his films Soderbergh shows he is clearly a Che groupie and because of it his focus remains myopic and narrow. He spends too much time building his monument to Che and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his saga, especially Fidel Castro. Making matters worse he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never catches fire.

Yeah, yeah, heard it all before, BORING AND UNTRUE!. The reality of Che Guevara is very different and far more explosive! The facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messiah streak, who openly wanted to impose Maoist tyranny on the world. He was so fanatical that at the hottest moment in the Cold War, he even begged the Soviet Union to nuke New York, Washington or Los Angeles and bring about the end of the world. CHe urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against US cities. For the rest of his life, he declared that if his finger had been on the button, he would have pushed it. When Khrushchev backed down and literally saved the world, Che was furious at the betrayal. If Che is recommendations had been followed, you would not be reading this review now. How a homicidal maniac became a pop icon would have made a much more interesting film. Incredible that no filmmaker has been daring enough to show the real side of Che and his posthumous media transformation. THAT WOULD MAKE AN Oscar WINNING FILM! I thought making independent film meant taking REAL RISKS and being GROUNDBRAKING! They only stick to safe counterculture themes, to wit, Che cool, Wall Street bad, Republican Nazi, Bush ex Hitler, NRA is worse than KGB, Christians are fanatics and stupid, etc...ad nauseum.

Everything comes to a head when he crosses the border into Bolivia and the government forces step up their campaign to bring him down.Without the flitting between time and places of the last film, Soderberghs second instalment focuses solely on the action in the hills, and manages to be an even duller experience. And more pretentiously, the score has been drowned out, giving the second instalment more of an unwelcome air of artsieness that proves just as alienating. There is just an unshakeable air of boredom to the film that never lets up.

After about half an hour I began sighing, yawning, rolling my eyes, cursing the reviewer at the radio station, and hoping that it would be over soon. But the movie went on and on. When it finally ended I had sunken so deep into my chair that I must have looked somewhat similar to Stephen Hawking. The most annoying parts of the movie are a The girl, who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with. She wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie one year, and shows exactly two facial expressions Joy and Seriousness. She is cute, no question about that. However, a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her alltoohuman presence. I found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear, drown in the river, or something similarly terrible. b The commentary by the girls adult voice, which tells us nothing but negligible, obvious, boring, redundant things. c The music, which is desperately lacking subtlety.

Do not get me wrong  CAGED TERROR is nominally more technically competent than, say, MONSTERAGOGO or THE GUY FROM HARLEM or something of that ilk. What solidifies its claim as Worst Movie Of All Time for me is its unique blend of bare proficiency with crippling pretension. Is it a Vietnam commentary? An ecological protest? An incitement to race riot? A study of mans inhumanity to man? A novel exercise in padding nature footage out to nearly feature length? In short a hep young urban professional possibly the most loathesome screen character ever somehow seduces a nubile AsianAmerican associate into camping in the woods with him.

Meanwhile, Jarvis addresses the Troubadour as Trouby once every two minutes, bringing to mind nothing so much as the alien star of Juan Picquers POD PEOPLE. That is about all that happens in CAGED TERROR, and such a synopsis perhaps makes it seem almost tolerable. But trust me, I have seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one has remained, for the past eight years since I first saw it, the absolute worst. I pop it in the old VCR once every two years or so just to reassure myself, and reassure myself I certainly do. I think the element which makes CAGED TERROR so particularly hateful is this very little happens, and although what little does happen happens quite poorly and quite slowly, what truly makes it compulsively unwatchable is the suffocating sense that the filmmakers REALLY, REALLY WANT to shove some kind of message down your throat. But because CAGED TERROR is so incompetent and ineffectual, what was intended as a civics lesson becomes a crash course in intense viewing discomfort. This film is 75 minutes long and feels like three and a half hours. It is terrible, truly truly terrible. Folks, trust me, I saw GHOSTS THAT STILL WALK and this one is worse. Go see it!

Whoever wrote that must be insane if they thought such a awful description could tempt us into viewing the video. Yet unfortunately, whichever faceless individual was responsible for that tragic use of English was doing their job only too well.. the movie contained within the little plastic case IS as bad as it sounds, and then some.Karin Mani plays the title role, and the script basically tells her during every given scene to either a Pout like a goldfish b Kick male butt or c Show off her feminine attributes. No complaints about the latter, but in terms of the other two.. let us just say she is not much of an actress, and is even less convincing as a martial arts expert. But even Meryl Streep with Cynthia Rothrocks body what a scary thought would fail to save this movie. The unfolding of the plot is boring beyond belief, as we get one ineptly directed fight sequence after enough, pausing only for hysterical courtroom shenanigans and the occasional gaginducing love scene with the interestingly named Robert Torti. The camerawork also follows a similar path of shame, with far too many unneeded closeups and continuity errors abound.The part that I think really sums this scumbucket of a movie up is where our heroine is sexually assaulted, and finds herself testifying in front of a corrupt judge while her richkid rapist leers at her from the box. Not only does he get off scotfree despite the overwhelming evidence against him, but she herself is then jailed for daring to protest about the verdict in front of his Honour. Behind bars, she then has a group shower, a lesbian crush, a couple of catfights and a nice, sweaty game of volleyball before being released on bail to continue her battle. This tenminute section has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, and the screenplay grinds to a halt to encompass it. I can only imagine the producers wanted to add a bit more TA to the mix, and came up with this needless subplot as a means to achieving that end.Which kinds of begs the question, is this an exploitation film, or a serious drama? Neither, is my response to that.. it is not sleazy or camp enough to appeal to fans of Tromastyle cinema, and it certainly does not make the grade as an exploration of one womans fight against the system.. purely because it is so appallingly made.

The dialogue is lacedmore like drownedwith fourletter words. You would think that people of their status would have SOME degree of intelligenceand a more extensive vocabulary.

So, I convinced two friends one afternoon to come see this movie with me. This review is my penance.In the first act we have the three lead studs, recounting their conquests in a diner. What should have been funny, or at least telling, comes out rather pathetic. Was there any redeeming quality about the three men and their encounters that we were supposed to get out of this?And while I do not mind movies that are cheerfully vulgar, I kept wondering why no one in the diner turned around when the studs talk loudly about sexual and scatalogical details. They do this every week at the same diner? You would think someone would complain. Oh, wait, I forgot two other diners do notice in one scene. But this is just a setup for a punchline. Everyone else in the diner is deaf.The second act has the three studs all falling for Mia and then developing brain rot, failing to ask each other or her about what is really happening between the four of them. And I kept asking myself, as the studs keep acting like they have been, what redeeming qualities does she see in them to stick with them longer than one date? Does she start out with brain rot? I kept hoping for Erics character, the married buddy, to become something more than simply the annoying punching bag in this act. His role is clearly to dispense advice on being married. But why do they even bother to talk to him when they will not talk to each other? And his advice? Sheeesh!The third act resolves what plot there is but by this time I was looking at my watch. My friends told me they were still waiting for something genuinely funny to happen and I had to agree. The Scene That Explains All was adequate and managed to explain all of the questions and mysterious dialogue bits throughout the movie but we were just checking them off a list. Oh, okay, that is why Brad had that happen and Jonathan says this and...What laughs we made were from the stupidity of the plot than at anything amusing.

The whole premise, or twist, of this movie is based on malebashing and the idea that an empowered women can play men just as they get played. Anybody, that thinks this is somehow a twist or is in any way original has obviously never turned on a TV before. Twisted, shallow women are common. Malebashing is the norm. It is not stealing from anything specifically, it is worse it is stealing from clich\u00e9s. I cannot imagine a women making a movie that depicted other women based so much on stereotypes and with this sense of contempt. Makes me want to go rent In the Company of Men  or better yet, There is Something About Mary. This movie wants to be a edgier version of There is Something About Mary so bad you can see the sweat. The movie has no insights into women, men, dating, sex, or really anything. Cohen is simply content to regurgitate myths he has been indoctrinated with from other sexist movies. On the other end, the movie does not work as a satire either, because even though it is ripe with exaggerations one could view as satirical it does not have that grounding in reality that satires need. It does not even know what it is satirizing. Then there is the dialogue, which is little more then the characters screaming obscenities at each other. Example Character 1 Fk you Character 2 Oh yeah, well fk you repeatAnd the bottom line, the thing that could excuse all the other discretions There are a lot of movies without plots, without good acting, with morally repulsive characters and obscenity laced dialogue that have been funny and thus, been good. Whipped as not funny. Not for a second. It has no comic skills or timing. The situations are all completely phony, not based in any shred of truth, especially enough to wring laughs out of us. The characters all broadly drawn so they will SEEM relatable to the lowest of the lowest common denominator. Just look at the marquee scene, cult classic hair gel scene. One of our bumbling antiheroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees Mena Peets vibrator. For some reason light shines down on it as if he is found the holy grail. Why Cohen thinks men react this way to vibrators I do not know. While he rubs it on himself, he drops it in the toilet and then attempts to fish it out with his bare hands when, oh my, Mena walks in on him. Oh, my sides. But strangely enough, people actually like this movie. Of course, people also like Friends and reality dating shows so I should not be surprised. All of this has a common thread however. Whipped is big evidence to me that there is just a huge pocket of people in America that will laugh at any joke just because it is about sex. They will like any show or movie or think they like it just because it is about dating or relationships. It is lack of any quality has no baring on these people. Just as people are indoctrinated to want whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they are also indoctrinated to blindly lap up anything datingrelationship related to sell them cheap, empty, effortless TV, movies and any number of products.

The print I saw was terrible due to age, but it is possible that there are better prints out there. However, this was not the major problem with the movie. The problem was that although the film was made in 1933, it was essentially a silent film with only the barest of dialog scattered only a few sentences in the film in the most amateur fashion. Sometimes the characters backs were turned or they were talking with their hands over their facesall in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and cleaverly ? hide the fact that the film was dubbed. Well, its true that this Czech film would need to be dubbed into many languages but to do it this way was really stupid and obvious. It just looked cheap.Overall, the film looked low budget and silly. It is really a shame though, because there was a grain of a good storya young woman who marries an older man who is either gay andor has no interest in women. But in the 21st century, few people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess. EVEN with a few glimpses of the naked and somewhat chunky Hedy Lamarr, it is not worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it debuted. Even by 1933 standards, this film was a poorly made dud. About the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different Lamarr looked in 1933 compared with the glamorous image Hollywood created when she came to Americashe looks like 2 completely different people.It is such an incomplete looking and technically inferior film, I do not see how it has gotten such rave reviews. For technical problems alone, the movie cannot rate a 10 or anything near it.","label":0},{"index":3228,"txt":"It is unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camerawork and busy but scratchy background score that accompanies this 1933 release. Although sound came into general use in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman, unhappily married, who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods.The most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town, proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wifes lover. In a frenzy of jealousy, he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment, losing his nerve. It is probably the most tensionfilled scene in the otherwise decidedly slowmoving and obviously contrived story.HEDY LAMARR is given the sort of closeup treatment lavished on Marlene Dietrich by her discoverer, but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to Hollywood. Her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love ARIBERT MOG, the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim.The swimming scene is very brief, discreetly photographed, and not worth all the heat it apparently generated. The lovemaking scene, later on, is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the filmartfully so. More is left to the imagination with the use of symbolismand this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece.Not so. It is disappointing, primitively crude in its sound portions including the laborious symphonic music in the background and certainly Miss Lamarr is fortunate that Louis B. Mayer saw the film and on the basis of it, gave her a career in Hollywood. He must have seen something in her work that I did not.It is apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work. The jarring workers scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed.

There is still potential for the series, however. Of course when I first saw Voyager I thought it had potential, too  but was sorely disappointed. My gut tells me Enterprise will not be as bad as Voyager, however.As for the impressions of the pilot...The pilot had some good ideas and good themes. I liked the introduction. The show is opening credits were interesting, with the progress of exploration and a fitting theme song. Scott Bakula is excellent in the role of captain.Where it fell short for me was largely that the story lacked the feel of setting out on a grand adventure. The plot of the episode itself was more a generic Trek story with the themes of exploration and first step towards space merely subplot and subtext. Were you to edit out the references to this being the first deep space mission, the plot would be hard to differentiate between the eras of Enterprise, TOS or TNG. The central plot did not reflect or do justice to the grand theme of the series. The plot of launching the first mission would have been grand enough without the action. Instead of isolated references to the newness of exploration, they could have been the story. Get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it oh, for a TV show that once again would make us THINK. Make us feel the excitement of the wind and being on the sea instead of distracting us with a rescue and a plethora of gunplay. There was WAY too much gunplay.We had the feeling more that humans were the freshmen in an established school. New kids on the block, as opposed to venturing into a largely unknown universe. Sadly, the Klingons landed on our doorstep instead of us finding them. That meeting could have been far more historic and far more sociological. Just how DO two such different societies interact? Do not just hint about it, SHOW it!I had to think of it more as Trek with an akward crew and limited technology as opposed to the first brave steps into the unknown. I wanted to see something newer and fresher. The series promises to have a new concept but so far I have not seen this new, great concept.I will conclude with reiterating the sentiment that the series has potential. There are some interesting characters. Bakula is wonderful. Blalock has potential. The overall theme is the most interesting since we first saw Kirk in a world before Apollo 11. If only future episodes can do justice to this grand and wonderful theme, we will have a show which will create new legends.You shoot an arrow into the air... Good luck Capt.

Little did I know... I had no idea this movie was based on a book by Britney Spears This movie was implausible throughout. It is obvious that whoever wrote the script never set foot in a conservatory and does not know a thing about classical music. Let me give you just a few examples 1 There is NO WAY anyone would be admitted to a classical conservatory with no classical training whatsoever! Just having a nice pop voice is not enough, besides, that is a different thing altogether  another genre, different technique. It is like playing the violin when applying for a viola class. 2 How come the lady teaching music theory was in the singing jury? If she was not a singing professor herself, she would have no say in a situation like that, and if she was a singing professor, why were not we told so? 3 Being able to read music is a necessity if you are to major in music. 4 How did Angela get a hold of that video tape? That would have been kept confidential, for the jurys eyes only. Now either she got the tape from one of the professors or the script writers just did not have a clue. I wonder which... 5 The singing professor gave Holly the Carmen song saying she had the range, which she clearly did NOT. Yes, she was able to sing the notes, but Carmen is a mezzosoprano, while Hollys voice seemed to be much lighter in timbre, not at all compatible with that song. 6 Worst of all Not only does the movie show a shocking ignorance when it comes to classical music, but it does not even try to hide it. The aria that Angela sings is mutilated beyond recognition, a fact which is painfully blatant at the recital, where it is cut short in a disgraceful way  Mozart would roll over in his grave. The Habanera from Carmen sounded a bit weird at times, too, and the way it was rearranged at the end just shows how little the producers really think of classical music  it is stiff and boring but hey, add some drums and electric guitars and it is almost as good as Britney Spears! I know these are all minor details, but it would have been so easy to avoid them with just a little research.

However, I was willing to overlook this and give it a fair shot. I was a bit shocked that there were only like four other people in the entire theater with me on that first day of showing. Now the whole crime and story in the film is hard to do, I will admit that. There were no witnesses to this very violent and brutal act. John Holmes was there, but he was also a pathological liar and worried about what would happen to his family and self if he talked to police about it. In fact, Holmes never really testified about what happened and the crime did go unsolved. So this was still really one big mystery, a mystery that this movie does nothing to cast light on. The person writing the screenplay had a whole lot of discretion and most of the principal characters are dead. However, there is no real storyline, it is fragmented claptrap. The script is light and the actors try to hard to beef up paper thin lines by overacting. The film gives no insight into Holmes or the other people involved. Kilmers character disappears for long stretches, his girlfriend is dull, the police are jokes. Even Kudrow tries hard to make a flimsy role look substantial. It is a very shallow piece and dare I say, boring. The director even tries to turn it into a love story. Which is nice, unless you know anything about what a piece of trash John Holmes really was. Perhaps a couple of viewings of Andersons Boogie Nights might have helped here. Boogie Nights was innovative and exciting in all regards.

While I have not seen that film, I would have to wager that there is more imagination and originality or some ripoff originality, in other words skill with known tropes of the Japanese ghost movie than in his own directed remake. Maybe the script was written to somehow have some kind of warped appeal, or I would guess accessibility, for an American audience. What starts off with some potential  the hint of something very screwed up going on with Bill Pullmans sudden movement  just goes into a total jumble. And as a horror movie? Gimme a break.Tension could have been built on the situation  a nurse going to take care of a disturbed woman in a house that is haunted  but he undercuts everything he wants to get his audience to feel. Scares? How is about some music timed just so you know when exactly to expect something. A black cat? Yeah, why not just make the ghostboy thing sound like a cat for creepiness which, in effect, is only creepy if you want cats. Plot? Why not just shuffle between past and present without any semblance of an actual flow of how a story could be told meaning, while the flashbacks are inserted and are meant to be organic with the story overall, they are not, or for that matter have us care about ANYONE in the cast.By the time the characters, or those that are there for exposition, get around to telling us what is going on or whatever, there is little point to care. The filmmaking is shoddy i.e. the 180 degree rule is broken many times over and not in a forgivable or intriguing way, and the performances are wooden even when looking frightened or shocked Gellar especially is disappointing, but Pullman, who shows up later after his first scene, is sorely miscast. Even when Shimizu tries for some average old Boo scares, like when the woman is in the office building and chased by the Grudge ghost, it is still silly. Just watch when she is going on that elevator and the ghost is in the background of shots. Either you will go with it, and if so more power to you, or you will laugh hysterically at the results. Count me in the latter.I am not totally sure where this project went wrong  was it Shimizu having to retool it for the studios, or him not giving enough leeway with his revamp of his vision? Or maybe Raimi had some say in it and made things more confusing andor dull than they would be with someone else. The Grudge gives us a lot of information that does not make sense or at the least give us some horrorfodder to chew on.

But toward the end one understands there is not much to understand.

Such is the case with Columbia Pictures The Grudge. This cinematic atrocity began when an otherwise well intentioned American saw a Japanese made for TV film Juon and was inspired to remake the movie in English. This began a virtual tsunami of bad decisions which circumnavigated the globe until it washed ashore in Orlando on October 21, 2004.The premise, and I use the word loosely, involves a house in Tokyo haunted by a skinny Momma ghost who looks like a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette, along with her ghastly sidekick a chubby, rambunctious but evil second grader. Is there anything scarier than a creepy 8 year old Japanese boy? Sure there is! Count Chocula comes to mind. With this whimsical bunch we must add a mysterious black cat who I have affectionately named Chim Chim. Remember Speed Racer? As you have already guessed, they were murdered in this domicile of doom and now desire to kill everyone who enters the premises. You see, as explained by a Japanese detective, when someone dies in a rage their ghost seeks revenge on everyone who steps on the property lines as defined by the county commissioner or something like that, I forget. The story begins innocently enough with acclaimed thespian Bill Pullman leaping to his death from a balcony. My guess is Bill Pullman got this job because of his kids begged him for a trip to Tokyo Disneyland. Next we endure the mildly interesting saga of Nurse Yoko, oh no do not go in there screams the audience, but alas she heeds not the dire warnings and is predictably snuffed out like a magic lantern. About 30 minutes into the movie we finally see its American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Sarah Michelle Gellar might be a competent actress but I could not help thinking of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so much so that it was distracting. It is the equivalent to having Jennifer Anniston star in a movie about the adventures of six friends in New York. Try as you may, you just cannot stop thinking about the other project which made her famous. But I digress, Karen, the nurse is hired as a replacement for the original care giver who disappeared at spooks r us. She snoops around, meets the ghosts, coma lady dies, and some other stuff happens. Watching the fair haired vixen searching for clues I half expected her to find the ghost and pull its mask off to reveal it was actually old man Gower who owned the abandoned amusement park! I would have gotten away with it too if it were not for you meddling kids and that dog of yours! Director Takashi Shimizu, who is vying to be the Ed Wood of Asia, made two unfortunate decisions involving sound. First, he choose to use a soundtrack only when someone is about to be killed. This is an excellent devise for obliterating any suspense because the audience gets a two minute warning to prepare for another miserably predictable murder. Second, he gave the ghosts a bizarre guttural noise that sounds like a gargling gopher. After the movie, I heard several people exiting the theatre making the sound and laughing.Sarah Michelle Gellar ends up being the sole survivor. And of course we learn that the fire she set to burn down the house was extinguished in time for the obligatory next chapter. However, considering the humorous reactions of the audience, they did not want a sequel but an apology. The Grudge could be easily reedited into a comedy, perhaps then it will be appreciated for its camp value. Baring that, this will go down as the greatest cinematic thriller since Godzilla vs. Megalon. I would suggest waiting until the movie comes to your local discount theatre where it can receive the public ridicule it so richly deserves.","label":0},{"index":3260,"txt":"All the kids aged from 1416 want to see this movie although you are only allowed at 18.

Set as a prequel to the original Star Trek series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer, Rick Berman, who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a Star Trek series could be which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint. The actual showrunner, Brannon Braga, did not help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous Trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchises internal mythology it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck. Never have I seen a series that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors Jolene Blaylock exceptedlast so long. It is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience even a Trekker audience is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires. Unfortunately it appears as if Berman and Braga have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at Paramount that Enterprise suffered from franchise fatigue and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off. Produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they the audience will come.Simply put, In a TeeVee universe where we are given shows like Battlestar Galactica and The Shield the powersthatbe must give the viewing public a Star Trek that measures up and is dramatically competitive.

And it is not really clear what Bill Pullmans character had to do with anything. He just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot. It did not make a lot of sense what happened to the original family. Who was hanging in the room, the little boy or the dad? And was Yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her?

After viewing other movies based on the works of Japanese writers, I have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in Japan is not what is frightening here in the US.

There, I said it. And now that I have gotten that out of my system, please let me explain why.When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born. The curse gathers in that place of death. Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury. That is the premise of THE GRUDGE and I will admit it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately, the filmmakers take it no further. Those who encounter the curse are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get. You want more? Well too bad. Some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of THE GRUDGE is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no plot to speak of, creepy images and sounds can only go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu, pulling a George Sluizer and remaking his own original films, valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour \u0096 by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over. It pretty much unfolds like thisperson walks into housesomething flashes by the camera andor a strange sound is heard person goes to investigatesound starts to get loudperson sees a ghostloud scream andor cat screechcut to blackBefore the audience is even given a hint of plot, this exact same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour. The first time was actually somewhat creepy. Each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on. By the time the end of the film rolled around, my friend and I were laughingly wondering if this scene would end with a loud scream and a cut to black. We were never proved wrong.The film has no liner storyline, instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled. I have no problem with nonlinear storytelling when it is done right. The film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason. I have not seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2. And this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had. If you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death, how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone?Obviously greenlit the second the American version of THE RING made 15 million its first weekend, THE GRUDGE is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie. The scariest things about THE GRUDGE are that it made 40 million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the scariest movie ever made.

He is the son of a welltodo family with a good reputation, and he is on his way to law school. But like so many such settings, things are not quite as perfect as they appear. The expectations in this family far outweigh the love. Except for school, Tristans father rarely lets him leave the house. This seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family, which is partially revealed through flashbacks but is not spelled out until the very end. Tristans claustrophobic environment causes him to let loose in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity, when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party, and from there, Tristan befriends Sebastian Cole Corey Large, who pulls him into a drug dealing underworld.While technically wellmade, this movie suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that is not very engaging. Also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and outofplace, such as slowmotion, fastmotion, freezeframes and echos. These are the types of effects a director might normally utilize to show a characters perspective while on drugs, except in this case they seem to have been sporadically tossed in at random points, in some cheap attempt at style.Despite its cast of relative unknowns, performances were good all around, most notably with respect to the main antagonist Corey Large.

Interestingly, he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultralowbrow humor i.e. most Will Farrell films while adding elements of vicious social critique and classic cartoon violence and grossout humor.

It is just your average nuclear spill causing people to turn into zombies etc etc. The film kicks off with a sequence that sees people melting and that pretty much lets you know what you are in for; low quality zombie garbage. There is plenty of gore in the film, and it is a real good job otherwise the film would have been really boring. Zombie Bloodbath looks really cheap too, and was clearly put together by inexperienced filmmakers!

Is not it romantic... Of course, he is spared by a quirk of metaphysical chance, and washes up on the beach, just as this same air traffic controller is riding by on her bicycle. They immediately clinch.Looking past the bizarre homoerotic subtexts, so over the top you really need to refer to them as supertexts, from a naked boy sitting barebutted in the sand playing the movies twilightzoneesquire theme on his little flute, to a celestial courier so campyqueeny his makeup is caked on more thoroughly than the ladies, the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love. We get itfly boys like girls in skirts and heels, and girls like em back, and, apparently, all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on IMDb...As for the quality of the production, the continuityediting is poor enough to induce cringing, and the lighting is, perhaps, even worse than that, but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad. There are games played with Technicolor, whatever passes for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that, and foreshadowing, so funny my fellow audience member who usually like movies like this actually cheered and laughed when then the docs motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck, and freezemotion, which is funniest of all because the female lead is so poor at standing still you know the stage hands were guffawing off camera.The best shots are the early ones on the beach, but, after that, it is all downhill. The moving like an escalator is moving staircase is hardly the Odessa Steps, to say the least, and I would really caution anyone from feeling like they would have to see this lame attempt at moviemaking on their account.

Raimi and co. did it with The Evil Dead, Jackson and pals succeeded with Bad Taste; and Myrick and Sanchez made a mint with The Blair Witch Project.Director Todd Sheets and his chums, however, are destined to wallow forever in relative obscurity if Zombie Bloodbath is anything to go by. A lesson in how not to make a cheapo horror, this miserable effort about a plague of flesheating zombies\u0097natch serves as a reminder that, whilst many people these days have access to a video camera, most should not take that as their cue to try their hand at making a fulllength movie.It is not that Sheets has not got an eye for a nicely framed shot some of his camera angles and movements are actually pretty good, but rather that a he has a lousy script b he has a lousy cast, and c he does not realise that he has a lousy script and cast. Which means that the final film is amateurish in the extreme, and unlikely to be watched in its entirety by anyone other than zombie film completists like me or members of the cast and crew like those who have given the film favourable comments.Zombie Bloodbath is obviously aimed at undiscriminating gorehounds, and Sheets who currently has an incredible 34 titles under his belt as a director certainly goes out of his way to please, with buckets of offal and blood thrown about at every opportunity. But whilst these moments are undeniably yucky, they are not particularly convincing, and soon get rather tedious.So, to summarise, this is a really bad film, with almost no redeeming features. Except for twoFirstly, it features the single greatest mullet in the history of film, as sported by Jerry Angell, who plays Larry as well as several zombies. The magnificence of his barnet coupled with a fetching moustache is reason alone to watch this film.Secondly, it has pathetic stealth zombies flesheating corpses that lie in wait for unfortunate victims to wander by, before leaping from their hiding place to launch a feeble attack, which requires almost no effort to escape from. Best known for lurking behind a door for hours waiting for someone to open it, pathetic stealth zombies also occasionally hide behind low walls, or sit in churches posing as members of the congregation.Normally a film this bad would get 110 for me, but, in celebration of Jerry Angells flowing locks, I will generously raise my rating to 210.","label":0},{"index":3290,"txt":"Well, I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy thinking it would be mindless gory fun. That is what it is, without the fun. This film truly is mindless, it is absent of any plot or character development, or any sort of storyline. The basic problem with this movie is the kills and gore. Basically, every kill looks EXACTLY the same. ZOmbies ripping someone apart. Yeah, that is okay, but you need some original kills too. I mean it got really lame, every kill looked exactly the same, filmed exactly the same way. Thats what killed me. I love gore, and the gore in this film did nothing for me. It was just boring. No storyline, just the same lame scene over and over again with a different person. I wanted to like this movie, too. I love shot on video gore movies...like Redneck Zombies. But I could not kid myself. This film has it is good points, but none of those are in the film.

Try to imagine a movie where every scene, line, and even every acting nuance was designed to be a parody. I could probably crap out alphabet soup, rearrange what was left of the letters, and still have a better script. Two scenes in particular come to mind when I think of this movie. SPOILER ALERT! One is when Mikes dad and the other dad walk, I repeat walk down a staircase jam packed with zombies. This is a small staircase and even though they brush up against the flailing undead, nothing happens to them. When they reach the end, the exmarine turns around, says God you are a horny bastard, and shoots only one. The other is in the military complex. The girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded. The camera moves around her for roughly forty seconds, while she is surrounded by zombies at an arms length away. She then almost casually runs out from the crowd and joins the other humans. SPOILER ALERT OVER! These scenes must be seen to be believed.

Arthur Penns film had style, humor, a point of view, and was made by talented people. Even if the 1967 version did not exist this would still be an unnecessary film. The 1967 version strayed from the facts, presented a glamorized version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting, and innovative for 1967, and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care.

Buck and Blanche went to convince Clyde to go straight much earlier than the one shootout, and in fact got drawn back into crime. Some of the events that were portrayed in daylight actually took place at night. Bonnies wound was much more severe and never healed right. It was so bad she had to be carried around by someone until it healed up, and even then it stiffened up so she walked stiffly. Clyde also walked with a limp because while in prison he cut off a big toe. I know, I am being nit picky, and it was a TV movie, but even without these factual errors in this TRUE story, the movie moves too fast from event to event and comes across more as several separate snapshots of their lives, rather than being a cohesive flowing story.I would recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.","label":0},{"index":3295,"txt":"Even though this was a madeforTV production, there is absolutely no excuse for the rock bottom results of the finished product.

To call The Crater Lake Monster amateurish is to overstate the obvious. If you are not a fan of low budget drivein films, you probably would not be looking here in the first place.The problem with the movie is that when there is no monster action going on, it really sucks and goes nowhere. The script is very Ed Woodish, in that it is utterly contrived in the way it sets up the main action sequences. Nothing is too outlandish for The Crater Lake Monster. It explains its dinosaur by having a meteor crash into Crater Lake, superheating the water to the point where it incubates a dinosaur egg that has apparently been resting at the bottom of the lake for millennia. Even if we could accept that the egg could have been lying there for so long and remained uncovered and viable, would not superheating the water to such a high temperature cause most of the lake to evaporate? Other than some token fog in one or two scenes, we see no evidence of the water being hot, other than a few lines in the script.The script is padded rather obviously in a few sequences, and it will do anything to get the characters near the lake so that they can be menaced by the claymation dino. A couple just passing through experiences car trouble and while their automobile is being serviced, they decide to rent a boat and head out into Crater Lake. Hmmmm...do you think these strangers in the story could be there so they would run into our title monstrosity? In a sequence that is just plain bizarre, a drunk robs a liquor store and decides to murder the cashier and a bystander instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of booze. A car chase ensues, and would not ya know it...they end up right by the lake. Snack time for Cratey!

I just cannot do it. There is not enough here to go on, and this is more of a movie to put on during a party, because you could talk right over it and it would not matter. The film has a slim list of the things going for it, the most important being the dinosaur itself, which appears in three forms a shadow puppet, a large model head that is dragged woodenly through the water, and a fully realized claymation insert that actually looks pretty good. There are also a pair of lovable hicks in it, and they carry the majority of the intentional humor in the movie. A downbeat ending leaves us mourning the death of both the monster AND one of our beloved hicks, so every good thing about this film is dead by the end of it.

Next worst is everything about the plot, which is loaded with soap opera scenes. Nothing in the movie seemed believable I could not believe what all the conflict was about.

The character of Alison is not even hardly shown in the first part of the film. All of a sudden she is the center of attention next to Stanley Caldwell. The role did not make sense and it should have been thought out a little better. Dahlia Salem was absolutely terrible. Her acting was way below decent and the casting people should have looked for somebody else, anybody else. The director, Mike, was a confusing character. He seemed to have a purpose for being there but it did not seem like his death was necessary. The acting for this role was good, nothing great but better than Salems.The plot was real lousy if you think about it. Stanley, who is presumed dead, makes his way onto the set of Cabin by the Lake, the movie based on his script. He stumbles upon the director and in a short time, the director is dead and Stanley is running the show. Yeah, out of nowhere the crew is just going to let this stranger come into the picture and finish the film not knowing anything about him. There is some killings, not a whole lot, and the ones that are shown are ridiculous. One of the actresses on the set gets electrocuted while filming a scene. Another character gets chewed up by a motorboat. And one gets tangled up in a plant before drowning. These writers must have been hard up for excitement.I just have to say that I was not impressed with the filming of the movie. The way that it kept changing from looking low budget back to normal started to become irritating very fast. Also, the new cabin by the lake was poorly created. We are not shown it but only in a few scenes, and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless. It worked in the first film only because we were shown the room a lot more, but it did not work in this one.There were too many characters in this sequel. All of them except for a few had no reason to be there. The acting of what little is showed was really bad and...they just did not have a purpose in this movie.All in all, Return to Cabin by the Lake is a sequel picking up from where the first left off. Cabin by the Lake I can take but this was just not impressive. Judd Nelson should have avoided this one and so should you. It is nothing like the first and it went entirely too slow. Nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to drag on for the second. Not to mention that the writing was horrible. Put this on only if you need some help getting to sleep.So, we see that Stanley defies death and is still alive and well.

Sadly, they did not. The main problem is that the two protagonists, Mac  Sam, are completely unsympathetic. They spend the entire movie lying to womenand lying brutally in order to get them into bed, and the audience is supposed to find this funny, and be charmed.

The script is extremely poor, with repetitive scenes, setups that never lead to anything, and illogical actions and statements by the characters. In fact, the characters are never really developed at all. The males are boorish, greedy jerks, and the women merely interchangeably beautiful.

The only bright spots I found in the movie were one dance number that had brilliant sets, and a few slapsticky moments involving the Frenchfarce, doorslamming aspects of the story. But Bollywood dancing is better enjoyed in movies choreographed by Farah Khan, and for slapstick you might as well just go straight to the silent comedies of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, who seem to have influenced writerdirector Priyadarshan not a little. Priyadarshan also takes false credit for inventing the story the basic premise of the plot is stolen from the 1960 play Boeing Boeing. The original author of that work, Marc Camoletti, is credited nowhere.

But, sad to relate, nothing worth talking about let alone making a movie about has happened to either of them in the intervening years. So, instead, the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another most having to do with older women in the workplace, while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner. The supporting cast is instantly forgettable, the humor is nonexistent, and the chemistry which Moore and Harper once had together is gone. Moore allegedly stalled this project for years, waiting for just the right script before committing herself. If this was the one she considered right, what on earth were the ones she turned down like? It is not the age of the characters that does this in for time inevitably marches on, but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work.

Having said that at least we know of the monsters motives  That is the only thing we learn . We never learn how they are able to change shape or are able to make cars become invisible and this jars with the ending that seems to have been stolen from THE TERMINATOR . Monster mother walks around killing several cops with her bare hands or blowing them up via a police issue hand gun  !  but if her monster breed is immune from police fire power then why do the creatures need the ability to change shape or become invisible ? The demise of the creatures is equally ill thought out as there killed by a mass attack of household cats . If they can be killed by cats then why did the monsters not kill all the cats that were lying around the garden ? There was a whole horde of moggies sitting around but the monsters never thought about killing them . I guess that is so the production team can come up with an ending . It was that they started the movie my complaint lies We are treated to several scenes where famous horror movie directors like John Landis , Clive Barker and even Stephen King make cameos . I think the reason for this is because whenever a struggling unknown actor read the script they instantly decided that no matter what , they were not going to appear in a movie this bad so Stephen King had to phone up his horror buddies in order to fill out the cast . That is how bad SLEEPWALKERS is Unbelievable as it seems that was not the worst line in the movie . The worst line is   That cat saved my life ","label":0},{"index":3372,"txt":"So on the Chills Network on cable they are having Vampire Month, I am such a dork, but I love vampires. So after a few duds that they showed I was pretty disappointed, but then I noticed Sleepwalkers was written by Stephen King. So I decided to go ahead and check it out, well much to my surprise, this movie was really bad. Most Stephen King films are entertaining and some are very scary. While Sleepwalkers was bad, it was a beautiful kind of bad. I had a good time laughing at this movie and just taking it for what it was. I have never read Sleepwalkers, from what I understand this is the only real vampire story by King, so I cannot really compare book to film. I do not know if it was just my TV, but Sleepwalkers looked like it was made for TV. The special effects were corny and the story was a bit far fetched, even if it is fantasy, it had a lot of problems. Charles Brady and his mother Mary are vampires who feed off the life force of virgin women. They are considerably more resilient than humans and have powers of both telekinesis and illusion. Their one weakness is cats, who are not only able to see through their illusions but whose claws are capable of inflicting severe to fatal wounds upon them. They also maintain an incestuous relationship. Charles and Mary have taken up residence in a small Indiana town. Charles attends the local high school, and there he meets Tanya Robertson in his creative writing class. Tanya does not suspect the real reason why Charles wants her so much; to take her life force for his mother, who is starving. At first, it seems that Charles has fallen in love with Tanya. On their first date, however, a picnic at the nearby cemetery, Charles attempts to drain the life force from Tanya while kissing her. As it happens, Deputy Sheriff Andy Simpson who had earlier tried to pull Charles over for speeding, drives by the cemetery and notices Charles car. When Tanya runs to him for help, Charles tracks Andy down and kills him. When Charles then turns to resume his life forcedepleting make out session with Tanya, the deputys cat, Clovis, rises to the occasion and nearly kills Charles by scratching him in the face and chest. Mortally wounded by Clovis, Charles staggers back home to Mary. Mary then seeks vengeance on Tanyas family.So to sum this movie up basically you should expect the cheese to overflow. The scene where Charles attacks Tanya for the first time is very clich\u00e9 and you almost vote for Charles to win just because Tanya is one of the dumbest female leads in horror movies. Then you gotta love the scene where Mary has a gun and shoots it at a cop car and somehow the whole thing explodes, God bless Hollywood explosions and exaggerations. I am taking the movie for what it is, it is just so deliciously bad that it turns into a dark comedy for me that I could just enjoy making fun of. I am not sure if this is what Stephen King wanted to see for his story, but he does have his typical cameo in the film. So my suggestion if you watch this movie, just take it for what it is and do not over think it, it is mindless entertainment with corny effects, bad casting, a silly story and enough cats to make the crazy cat lady from The Simpsons say Wow, that is a lot of cats.410","label":0},{"index":3373,"txt":"I liked Batman Dead End. A dark edgy filmnoir setting for Batman was perfect. Batman Dead End is good. This is not.First of all let me start off with the acting. None of it is really that good. The best would probably be Clark Bartram as Batman. But that is not saying much. He is good at first glance, and then you realize he is what he is, a bodybuilder who happens to be a tolerable actor. But mainly the problem is that Batman does not belong in the daylight, he looks like a freak running around in a Bat suit. Instead of a horribly scarred man trying to make up for past mistakes. The daylight also reveals an irritating dorky scowl on Bartrams face which never leaves and unoticeable in Batman Dead End, probably because of the darkness of short which is so desired in this trailer. Bartram seems to think that scowling and stubbornly shaking his head is acting, it is not, it is quite the opposite. It is called posing, something real actors avoid like the plague.Something I never understood why Collora casted bodybuilders as the leads. It makes much more sense to give the role to an actor who can manage it, instead of a bodybuilder who can kinda manage it but HEY HE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE THE COMIC! Of course, they might have done better if Colloras dialouge did not leave much to be desired.The entire trailer yes, trailer. There will not be a fulllength film is more centered around Superman then Batman. But everything on the Superman side is corny, cloying and amateur. Michael OHearn Superman is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. He stands around, smiles, says his lines. That is about it. Although I am not surprised since he is just a bodybuilder they hired and possibly received a few acting lessons. Once again I say to Collora, cast ACTORS. Not bodybuilders. Actors will be so much more compelling that we will forgive the fact they do not look exactly like the comic book.The costume is what you would expect Superman to wear. As for the Batman suit. Well, I guess it only looks good in the dark. I say this because in some shots the suit looks like something you would buy from a Halloween gift shop.Superman flies in this movie. But that is not a good thing. These shots look especially amateur. This and a lot of the entire film looks like it was shot in their backyard with a VHS camera.The best shots are a shot of Superman catching a car in his hands. And the final shot of TwoFace and Batman at the very end. For those of you who have seen the trailer. You know what I am talking about. Now if only he could have stretched that shot through the entire trailer.Finally I ask. Why if you are trying to show your ability as a director, would you make a trailer as a short film? This proves nothing when it comes to being an actual director handling story. My only piece of advice for Collora here is, there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and being able to work in marketing.Batman Dead End did not feel amateur. I cannot figure out where this went wrong.","label":0},{"index":3374,"txt":"Giving credit where it is due, only the technicolor, costumes and sets deserve any honorable mention.This is undoubtedly the lowest point in BING CROSBYs long career at Paramount. The script is about as clumsy as you could possibly imagine and neither the casual Bing nor William Bendix nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do a thing about repairing it. Bendix looks extremely foolish in a page boy wig. And poor Rhonda Fleming has a stock costume heroine role requiring her to look adoringly at Bing and little else except for warbling a couple of uninspired ballads in a voice probably dubbed for the occasion.Just plain awful! Mark Twains wit is not evident in any of the screenplay. Only diehard Crosby fans can possibly appreciate this mess of a film given uninspired direction.

Maybe because I am from a different era and a different country, but I found Crosbys continual references to the Good Old USA pleasant at first, trite after a while and then finally annoying. Do not get me wrong  I am not antiAmerican whatsoever  but it seemed that the English could do no right andor needed this brave, oh so smart American visitor to show them the way. It is a fish out of water story, but unlike most movies of this sort, this time it is the fish who has the upper hand. To be fair to both myself and the movie, I have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time.I watched another Crosby movie last night  The Emperors Waltz  and that, too, produced the same reaction in me. And to my surprise even my wife  who for what is it is worth is American  found the in your face attitude of American Crosby to be irritating. One too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it. As for the premise of the movie, it is unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good. The scenery and the music is also good, as are the great costumes  although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix looks horrid picture Moe of The Three Stooges.All in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby but because he is in virtually every shot it is pretty hard to sit through this movie.","label":0},{"index":3376,"txt":"This movie was madeforTV, so taking that into account, I am not going to rip into it as hard as I would a feature film.

You can tell because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of films 24 frames per second. I am not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they did not have the money to shoot on film I assume this is why, anyway, but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look.Anyway, I have definitely seen worse movies, but I definitely would not say that I enjoyed this movie and I cannot recommend that anyone see it.","label":0},{"index":3377,"txt":"This was a cute movie at first, then then got too sappy and featured mediocre songs, at best.There is too much King James English spoken with is not only annoying in todays world but not always easy to interpret.

They can suck har har pun intended, and I will still love them because vampires are just cool in movies. Van Helsing, considered by many to be a steaming pile of crap, was enjoyable to me because of the fact that there were vampires. You may ask What does that have to do with this movie? The answer is that I intend to inform you of how horrible this movie truly is, that even a sucker harharhar for vampire movies like me can despise a movie like this so much.The movie stars Van Helsing, a college professor guy who is not at all convincing. He is a terrible actor, like everyone else in this movie, and he wrote it, to add salt to the wound. I honestly to not mean to offend him, and I am sure everyone had fun making this movie, but watching it was actually painful. I am not sure why I watched the whole thing; perhaps it was a morbid fascination, like watching an impending train crash it is horrible, but you cannot manage to force yourself to look away. Its main fault is that it is just so ing boring, and its plot is so damn ridiculous, even for a science fiction horror movie.But, I digress. By the way, Van Helsing has sex with his mom. Of course, he does not know it is her at the time; he just thinks it is one of his students which is still illegal and all, but not as disgusting and creepy.If I were Van Helsing, I would at least pull an Oedipus myself when I found out I had done something so gross. It would have made for one entertaining thing if he just made some comment on it, but no. The point is not even brought up at all, by any of the characters. It is as if the writer did not even think of it. I would have at least had another character laugh at him and say Ha ha, you had sex with your mom, which would be mildly humorous although blatantly immature. I am probably running out of room, so a few more words to dissuade you from ever seeing this film there is a vampire ninja fight with an old man. It would be funny, but the filmmakers expect us to take it seriously. It is not even worth watching the movie to see how bad it is. Stay far, far away from it if you value your time at all.I will say one thing positive about the movie the guy who plays Van Helsing is pretty slick with that knife of his. There is like, a minute long segment where he swings around his knife and actually does some pretty nifty tricks. It would be boring in any other movie, but here, sadly, it was the highlight.","label":0},{"index":3380,"txt":"An interesting concept vampirism having something to do with a virus.but done several times by now Overall the movie is too long and drags a bit.

But the worst technical problem is the audio. The level was good enough to hear the dialog, but many of the interiors have a echo sound to them, which is very distracting. Either they were not careful in the recording, or the sound mixing could have been better. Also too much background noise got through. The should have gotten someone to do sound effects for the martial arts scenes. The tinny clank of swords hitting together was not the sound of an epic battle. Especially in the combat scenes the editing needed to be tighter.Also the acting was a bit flat.

I felt the films biggest problem was its lack of a main plot. Instead, it was composed of too many subplots competing for screen time. As a result, there is not a single character who is developed enough for the audience to form any sort of attachment. What the director and producer failed to do was show us why we should care what happens to the characters. In fact any one subplot and the characters associated with it could have been removed altogether without serious detriment to the film. The time gained would have allowed for the much needed development of the remaining subplots and characters. Simply put, The Hungry Bachelors Clubs plate is overcrowded with side dishes and appetizers when an entre is desired.","label":0},{"index":3383,"txt":"I have to agree with some of the other comments and even go a step further. Nothing about this film worked, absolutely nothing. Delmar our central character makes the decision to become a surrogate mother in order to earn enough money to buy a restaurant but along the way fall for a wise exjailbird. At the same time her friend Hortense is trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to finally marry her. She also happens to be sleeping with Marlon who is desperately in love with her. Then there is Delmars brother Jethro who gets involved with a former coke addict, Missy who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father. On the sidelines we also have the eccentricmother who has an assortment of equally odd friends, one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film. So far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life, death, grief and love in the first half, the film simply loses direction. If the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed. For instance, why does Delmar think she will be able to hand over her child in exchange for money, especially when the prospective parents are a creepy bigoted lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife? Why is Hortense so desperate to marry a man who is a jerk and clearly does not love her? How is it Missy manages to kick her coke habit overnight? Is Jethro regularly drawn to women with overwhelming problems, or is Missy the exception? Has Delmar and Jethros mother always been on the eccentric side, or is it a more recent development? Why is Jethro so keen on Cadillacs that he has one in the middle of his living room? Why did Moses spend years in prison for stealing a car, a relatively minor crime? How does Delmar manage to end up giving birth to Moses baby when there is no suggestion that they ever had sex? These questions are posed in the screenplay but sadly are never answered. I can only assume they were answered in the original novel and that is why the writer felt the need to include it all in the script. Big mistake. Losing several subplots especially the Hortense and Marlon story, which adds nothing to the overall film, would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time to develop the Delmar, Jethro and Moses characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else. Add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all, including Jorja Fox who does her best to rise above the material. I am not surprised that this appears to have been the directors last film as this effort shows no evidence of a visual style or ability to tell a moving and intelligent story.","label":0},{"index":3384,"txt":"This movie has a very hardtoswallow premise, even by this genres standards.

The kid gets a copy of the record and it contains secret hidden backplay messages. It also is the key that opens the door so that the really bad metal singer can return to bring havoc and death to the world. The first part of this film is not a horror film at all, but rather an After School Special. We see the metal kid the outsider tormented over and over by the popular kids. And he fails to learn the most important lesson in high school movies When the cool kids who bully you suddenly invite you to a party, Do not GO! It is a trap. Especially if it is a pool party. Anybody surprised when he ends up in the water?? It was such an After School Special that I kept waiting for Melissa Sue Anderson to show up and teach Jody Foster a lesson.So back to the horror part of the film. So this metal kid gets some powers and instead of using them to kill the bully boys which would have made much more sense, he freaks out and tries to protect all of the bully boys and girls from harm. What? A sensitive hero? What fun is that in a horror movie? Thank goodness Carrie White did not follow this lesson. He actually tries to PREVENT having the music played at the Halloween Dance, the very music that could unleash a power to kill all the kids who had been mean to him. If it were me, I would have put that music on, and pronto. The rest of the movie is about this metal kid going around town trying to kill the horrible metal star he idolized. Why not partner with him and REALLY do some damage. Why you ask? It seems he is in love with one of the popular girls and does not want her hurt..more appropriate for a Molly Ringwald film. Is this a horror film or an episode of Beauty and the Beast? The movie just goes on and on at this point, with no scares, horror, or anything worth watching.

Eventually he gets into trouble with cops i.e. pigs at a rally, and spends the movie under the blue American capitalist skies, looking for freedom\u0085 Or something like that.Antonionis predictable assault on capitalism is not only intellectually hollow, but has or had nothing new to offer; it is just the same old triggerhappy onedimensional cops, businessmen discussing business deals and what is wrong with that, is not that how Antonionis movies get made?, and endless shots of TV commercials and billboards advertising the ohso morally decadent products for the abhorrent, selfish, and greedy rightwing rabblepopulation who thinks of no one but themselves, their families, their work, and their children.Papa Smurf Antonioni, just like his longhaired Smurfs and Smurfettes of the late 60s, failed to notice the most obvious and vital aspect about their silly movement they were allowed to have their laughable meetings and express their antiestablishment opinions freely within that very establishment, whereas the students in those countries whose leftwing systems they admired, did not and still do not. By far the greatest irony about the hippies  and Antonioni, naturally, failed to realize this as well his judgment being clouded by cocainesnorting and an excessive intake of LSD  is that hippies were are the garbageresidue of capitalism.

Only in a successfullyfunctioning capitalist system can you find that species called hippie; a spoiled, ungrateful, and selfish bunch of middle and uppermiddle class losers.The film itself seems to go on forever. Antonioni takes his sweet time with getting on with it, while including overlong scenes of pointlessness, with a high dullness factor. His attempts at symbolism are annoying and trite. His statements are highly dubious, at best. This film is Antonionis way of saying that violent revolution is the solution.

There, he meets a happen chick and they then sit around philosophizing for hours. Then, they have sex in one of the weirder sex scenes in cinema history. As they gyrate about in the dust, suddenly other couples appear from no where and there is a huge orgy scene. While you see a bit of skin warranting an Rrating, it is not as explicit as it could have been. In fact, it lasts so long and seems so choreographed that it just boggles the mind. And of course, when they are finished, the many, many other couples vanish into thin air.Oddly, later the couple paint the plane with some help and it looks a lot like a Peter Max creation. Despite improving the look of the plane, the evil cops respond to his returning the plane by shooting the nice revolutionary. When the girl finds out, she goes into a semicatatonic state and the movie ends with her seemingly imagining the destruction of her own fascist pig parents and all the evil that they stand for such as hard work and responsibility. Instead of one simple explosion, you see the same enormous house explode about 8 times. Then, inexplicably, you see TVs, refrigerators and other things explode in slow motion. While dumb, it is rather cool to watchsort of like when David Letterman blows things up or smashes things on his show.Aside from a dopey plot, the film suffers from a strong need for a single likable character as well as extensive editing. At least 15 minutes could easily be removed to speed things up a bitespecially since there really is not all that much plot or dialog. The bottom line is that this is an incredibly dumb film and I was not surprised to see it listed in The Fifty Worst Films book by Harry Medved. It is a well deserved addition to this pantheon of crap. For such a famed director to spend so much money to produce such a craptastic film is a crime!Two final observations. If you like laughing at silly hippie movies, also try watching THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK. Also, in a case of art imitating life, the lead, Mark Frechette, acted out his character in real life. He died at age 27 in prison a few years after participating in an act of revolution in which he and some friends robbed a bank and killed an innocent person. Dang hippies!!","label":0},{"index":3395,"txt":"Antonionis movies have aged not well. What always surprised me about them is that, besides an unquestionable plastic beauty, there is a dull and didactic psychology of the characters and situations. Remember, for instance, the conversations between Mastroianni and the wicked capitalistic that wants sing up him in La notte, or Monica Vitti laughing at the peasants flirting in the train in La aventura, or Ferzetti dropping the glass of ink at the end of the same film. I have reviewed yesterday Zabriskie Point. In this film there are a lot of nice and elaborate shots of the Rod Taylor office, the streets and highways of L.A., the publicity advertisements, the deserts,etc., that show the fascination of the author in his American journey, in the same way than Wim Wenders years later. Unfortunately, there are too a lot of hippieleftist clich\u00e9s that spoil the movie  The boy leaves the meeting, steals an aeroplane and flies over the desert in order to liberate himself and find something different.  The executives in grey suites speak all the time about speculation.  The girl looks at the object women in the swimming pool and leaves because she wants not to be like them.  The couple of fat middleclass in the caravan speak, in front of the beauty of the nature, of building a hotel and earning a lot of money.  Last but not the least, a lot of couples making love in the desert.

This movie is so horrible that it is not even funny to watch as a goof on the excesses of the hippie drone. It is like a left wing version of Dragnet, except without professional actors.

By setting such questions against a fabric of hippie youth movements, Antonioni questioned, intentionally or not, the effectiveness of these organisations. How can you fight for a cause when what you think is true may actually be a lie? On the flip side, the film said that we must fight and actively challenge what we see precisely because others may be deceiving us with false images and false truths. Though the hippie aspects were the most tacky parts of Blow Up, they created a nice texture and gave the film more meaning than it might otherwise have had. It was a very cautionary and mature little film.With Zabriskie Point Antonioni throws away all the ambiguities and subtleties of Blow Up and goes full blown hippie. The result is a film awash with bad metaphors, stupid ideas and heavy handed storytelling. How could somebody, who across his career displayed such restraint and intelligence, make something so silly? The film opens with a nice series of close ups, as we watch a group of radicals discussing the meaning of revolution. Suddenly one man Mark gets up and leaves. He hates the rigid and ordered nature of revolution. He recognises that, though revolutionaries fight for freedom, to bind oneself to such a militant cause is to effectively give your freedom away. And so like Jack Nicholson in The Passenger, Mark just wants to be free.As such, Mark buys a gun and goes solo. He takes orders from no one. When police raid his university campus Mark shoots a guy and runs away. He then flees to a nearby airfield, steals a small private plane and flies out to the desert. Antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful utopia, and contrasts it with the ruthlessly capitalist cities, with their billboards and hollow modern appliances. He sees the desert as a sort of Garden of Eden.In the desert, Mark meets Daria and quickly falls in love. Antonioni then gives us a ridiculous sex scene in which hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand. Free from the constraints of modern life, these treehuggers and student radicals can now celebrate their individualism by humping in the sun.The film ends with Mark dying and Daria fantasising about blowing up the mansions and stately homes of the rich capitalists who killed him. It is Antonionis challenge to his audience. Pick up the guns, pickets and explosives, he says. Tear the walls down before they cage you in!Of course the film had no effect on its audience. They recognised Zabriskie Point as being just another self centred commercial attempt at being radical. A sort of commodified radicalism. It felt untruthful and tame.Thematically the film is pretty stupid. Antonioni basically says that if you are unhappy with the modern world, and the fat cats who exploit you, you should either flee to the desert Mark or actively fight the system Daria. That is all well and good. But though artists constantly warn us of such dystopian nightmares, they are all mostly unable to show us how to effectively administer change. Like the end of Fight Club, nihilism and violence achieve nothing. In the real world, social change tends to be instigated by humble inventors, spurred ahead by minor technological advancements. I mean, what liberated women more than contraceptives?310  A very bad film. The problem is, Antonioni does not really believe in rebellion. He is a quiet and contemplative man. An introvert who seems to have made an extroverted film simply to garner more adoration from the counterculture who embraced his earlier film, Blow Up. As such, Zabrinskie Point comes across as a very pretentious and stupid film. It is essentially a 50 year old man say Look at me, I am a daring rebel!There are many films in which the audience is encouraged to fight the system, but they all fall into one of four categories. In the first category you have films like Network, Cool Hand Luke, Cuckoos Nest and Spartacus. These all show that the lives of freedom fighters all end in failure, though in each case the spirit of revolution survives. The message is that you can not effect change, but by dying or failing, the optimistic notion of change survives through martyrdom. Essentially we must keep on failing rather than give up hope.Then you have films like Fight Club, Zabriskie Point and Falling Down, which simply encourage you to explode. Tear it all down. Blow it all up. Everything is a lie, so you might as well go out guns blazing. These films are borne out of angry, reactionary feelings, rather than any sort of common sense.Then you have the flight rather than fight category. Terrence Malick and Antonioni are the masters of this genre. Films like The Passenger, Red Desert and Badlands show human beings running from worlds they do not like and forging islands or peaceful havens for themselves. Both directors are pessimists, in that Malick has his islands destroyed and Antonioni has his islands offering no sense of happiness or solution.Then you have the fourth category. Films like Donnersmarcks The Lives of Others, Ashbys Bound For Glory and Kubricks A Clockwork Orange, treat artists as a force of change and rebellion. In these dystopian worlds, in which everyone is content to be a slave to the state, it is the unbridled creativity and freedom of will of the artistcriminal who keeps the system in check. By simply existing outside of the herd, you create waves. Your comments, actions and critical eye, challenges the status quo. As such, Donnersmarcks film has novelists and artists undermining Nazi Germany, whilst Kubrick has Alex the artistcriminal fighting Nazi droogs, painting the town in blood and sperm.","label":0},{"index":3398,"txt":"There is nothing I hate more than selfcongratulating pretentiousness.

Brian Krause, who I thought was dreadful, overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced, portrays the loud, temperamental director who does not like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer, Alison..played by Dahlia Salemseem to be taking over the production. Andrew Moxham is Paul Parsons, who is the brother of a victim from the first film. The films dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it is worth. Nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty, with Stanley as clever as ever, using his brains to commandeer a film production, killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work, letting no one stand in his way..that is until Alison realizes who Stanley really is. Alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject..what motivated Stanley to kill, why would he do such a thing, and what led such a man down this dark path? The humor of Alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller. Of course, you get the inevitable showdown between Alison and Stanley, with a really ridiculous, unbelievable conclusion regarding the killers fate..quite a hard pill to swallow. Unlike the first film, which was photographed with sophisticated polish, director PoChih Leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed..such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles, slowmotion in a sepia color, and several instances which are captured on videoand rather annoy instead of impress.

Wizards of the Lost Kingdom scrapes the bottom of that 80s barrel, in a way that is truly insulting to barrels. A young runt named Simon recaptured his good kingdom from an evil sorcerer with the help of a mangy rug, a garden gnome, a topless bimbo mermaid, and a tiredlooking, pudgy Bo Svenson. SvensonNorth Dallas Forty, Inglorious Bastards, Delta Force, a longtime bmoovie muscleman, looks barely able to swing his aluminum foil sword. However, he manages to defeat the forces of evil, which consist of the evil sorcerer, Shurka, and his army of badly costumed monsters, giants, and midgets. At one point, a paper mache bat on a string attacks, but is eaten by a 12 hidden sock puppet, pitifully presented as some sort of dragon. The beginning of the film consists of what can only politely be described as bits of scenes scooped up from the cuttingroom floor of udder bad moovies, stitched together in the vain hope of setting the scene for the film, and overearnestly narrated by some guy who never appears again.

Writer Ed Naha and Hector Olivera who? watched enough similar type of movies to know that they needed a handful of essential characters, but probably figured that all the rest would follow automatically. In order to make a fantasyadventure you need one super evil villain preferably with a black cape, one young hero in training, one lone warrior, one amiable type of furry pet, one wise midget living in the woods optional and a whole colorful collection of hideous demons, enslaved dwarfs, and winged gargoyles to serve as filler. The story is phenomenal and so original, with Simon the young son of a wizard having to flee from his beloved kingdom after the evil magician Shurka takes over the power and killed the king. Simon wants to go back and save the people, but therefore he needs his powerful ring which he lost during his escape. Simon befriends lone warrior Kor the usually cool dude Bo Svenson who clearly needed the pay check, who assists Simon during the long and devastating journey full of ordeals, dangerous encounters and magical showdowns. Admittedly it does not even sound too bad thus far, but that is merely just because I excluded all the deliciously inept little details. Simon has a best friend named Gulfax, for example. Gulfax is an albino version of Chewbacca and evokes incontrollable chuckles whenever he opens his poodlesnout to yelp something incomprehensible. The obstacles during journey back home are hilariously irrelevant to the plot and simply serve as padding footage to cover up the lack of actual content. Simon has nightmarish visions inside the tent of a suspicious forest nymph, Kor settles an old score with the pigfaced nemesis whose sister he refused to marry and there is the supposedly horrible suicide cave where you can only sing your way out of.

Not only that, Mr. Sherman cowrote the screenplay and it was his idea to use Bob Livingstone, a washedup, 69 year old Western star of the old Hollywood era to be his male lead in a picture that Sherman thought would capitalize on the recent success of Swinging Stewardesses. Now why would you want to have a wrinkled old man as your male lead in what is supposed to be a softcore exploitation feature? It defies explanation, but that is Sam Sherman for you. His obsession with old Hollywood colored a lot of his films for Independent International Pictures, and he and Al Adamson frequently tried to get hasbeen actors for their films e.g. J. Carrol Naish, Russ Tamblyn, Lon Chaney Jr.,etc.. But Bob Livingstone? Tell me the drivein demographic knew who this 40s secondrater was; it is ridiculous! But then again, Naughty Stewardesses was a successful picture for them, so we cannot just write this off as a Sherman fiasco. Still, by any aesthetic standard, it is an incoherent mess. Al Adamson wanted out of this picture, and it is easy to see why. First off, it has no genre focus at all and drifts around from super soft core tits and asssimulated sex only to a kidnapping thriller shades of Stecklers Rat Pfink and Boo Boo! In between, we get subjected to painfully boring sequences of the stewardesses traipsing around Vegas to the hackneyed music of Sparrow, or Richard Smedley and Connie Hoffmann on a photo shoot in San Francisco. Worst of all, we get Bob Livingstone as a Jack LaLanne wannabe in a blue jumpsuit trying to be sexy...gag! Thankfully, his big sex scene with Connie Hoffmann was deleted, but you can catch him slurping on her titties on the DVD in the Special Features section. Creepy. This is a terrible, terrible movie, but I will give it three stars for Gary Gravers photography and out of sympathy to Connie Hoffmann for having to make it with Wrinkles Livingstone.

There is no grand art here. The movie was designed to make money and exploit a growing trend at the time to put nymphomaniacal stewardesses in films so that the audience could live out vicariously their voyeuristic tastes.

Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, and the great Christopher Walken. With such a cast, one can only expect the best.

Both are making a decent living, but because Tim has a better performance at work, he is able to afford more than his buddy Nick. Nick is a dreamer who is always coming up with new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick comes up with the idea for a spray can that makes dog poop disappear Yes, I am serious. Falling in love with the idea, Nick decides to really invent this product. He makes an offer to Tim to invest in his idea and share the profits 5050. Tim refuses thinking the idea will never work.Nicks invention, titled vapoorize again, i am serious, ends up making millions. He enjoys spending his money on things like a much larger house, a horse, a personal trainer, and fancy deserts. Tim starts feeling envy for Nick. Hence the name of the movie.The concept is not bad, but it still turns out awful. This movie contains some of the worst dialog and very poor performances from all the cast. Then again, as I mentioned earlier, none of them could save this mess. Not even the great Christoper Walken, playing a homeless character named Jman, made this movie funny.

The jokes which are few and far between are NOT funny in any way... the story line is crap, and they never answer the question... WHERE DOES THE SHT GO? Of course the answer to that is NO ONE CARES. This film lacks any sort of comedy value, and as a few other users have said the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching is Christopher Walken as the Jman.

Stiller and Black do not show all their talent in this movie.So, if you are about to rent a comedy, I suggest you definitely do not go for this one.

I found the sheer absurdity of Zoolander utterly hilarious when it was released, Starsky and Hutch was also enjoyable, and then Dodgeball kept the laughs going for a lot of people, although personally i was a bit tired of the overthetop characters  especially when the scenario was not quite so funny perhaps the comedy of a Dodgeball tournament does not quite translate to Australia, where it is rarely played. So in an attempt to do something a little more original, Envy moves away from an absurd scenario and instead revolves around the absurd creation of Jack Blacks character i will not spoil what it is for those who intend to see the movie. The problem is that the movie seems to drag, i am not a big enough movie buff to be able to think of examples, but it seems like this set up has been done a thousand times before  and very rarely successfully. So instead of a nice, crisp, enjoyable and fresh comedy, you get a film that seems to just go through the motions. Sure the motions can be quite amusing, and they are centred on an idea that is quirky enough to provide a few laughs  especially with Jack Black playing the excited and amusing, though a bit 2D, creator. Ben Stiller on the other hand seems a bit lost, he is asked to play a fuller role than the ridiculous characters of his Zoolander breed of movies, but he struggles as a family man, whether his fault or the scripts, there is not enough depth to the character and the result is a movie of Ben Stiller doing those typical mannerisms and generally becoming tedious. The performance does not leave an imprint on the viewer he is just Ben Stiller, Jack Black manages to actually portray a character  though not a challenging one. The last annoying element of the movie is Christopher Walkens role as The J Man, which is about as typical and two dimensional as characters come, and naturally he becomes monotonous and frustrating very quickly.It is really not as unbearable as some people would have you think, it is watchable, especially if you are in the right mood feeling silly would be a good prerequisite for seeing this film. Hire it on a movie night with friends and watch it after you have watched a scary film and feel like something light  hopefully you will also be somewhat tipsy by then too.

Stiller is his unfunny self,but now even with someone to bail him out, proves that he is way overrated as a comic. It is no wonder why this movie tanked badly, and was available of the dollar movie theaters after only a handful of weeks. I warn you, and you must warn your friends, Do not watch this flick, it is just awful, worst then Gothika personally, i would never thought i would say that, worst the Plan 9, Worst the Ishtar, worst then The Golden Child.

Christopher Walken especially would like to forget this bomb, because his character is so weak.

No matter how bad they are, I can find something to like about Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn or Will Ferrell or Jack Black.

This time, it is Ben and Jack Black as a couple of nutty neighbors, one of whom Black discovers a aerosol spray to make animal poop disappear and becomes incredibly wealthy while the other Stiller writhes in envy. That is supposedly the plot, but then it veers off in other directions that do not really make much sense.I guess the Vapoorize thing is sort of amusing at first. The problem is, they try to sustain the gag for the whole picture Black has a license plate that reads Caca King and it gets fairly tiresome. But even Ben and Jack are used poorly; the energy level for both of their performances seems significantly dialed down. The two best performances by far are Rachel Weisz and Chris Walken. Walkens neohippiedippie guy is so offbeat and so wellmodulated a performance that it really never suggests any of Walkens other familiar nutcase characters. It is completely unique, yet comes across as unmistakably Walken. And Weisz is about the best actress in the business that nobody knows about. Even with limited screen time, she still dominates every scene she is in.The whole crux of the socalled drama is that Ben, in a jealous drunken stupor, accidentally shoots Jacks prize white stallion, and then goes to ridiculous lengths to cover it up, fearing his best friend will find out and cut him dead. But the plot twist is not believable because there is nothing about Jacks character to indicate that he would do such a thing. He plays such a sweet guy that it renders the whole excruciating horse chase null and void. You discount it completely. It is all filler. And what is the point of the outofcontrol merrygoround, except that Barry Levinson wants us to know that he is seen Strangers on a Train? The screenplay is painfully bad and the acting of the two leads poorly directed. Someone with Levinsons track record should know better.

Yes, there are unlikeable characters. That is not the problem. It is that they are unlikeable and we do not care for them at all. The War of the Roses featured unlikeable characters but due to proper introductions we grew to at least find ourselves interested in their fate, whereas in Envy the introduction is thin, the characters are never believable, and the plot only makes things worse.Ben Stiller is simply repulsive in his role and I am a fan of his work most of the time. Stiller campaigned to have this released straighttovideo and now I can see why. The movie proposes that he is best friends with Jack Black, but from the first five minutes we are given footage that seems to indicate Stiller hates Black. I thought this would develop into some sort of onesided relationship a la The Cable Guy but it never does, instead Stiller insists he is his best friend and I felt confused as he seemed to treat Black like, well, poo. The movies plot is ridiculous but it does not matter, because it is supposed to be an exaggerated morality tale. Unfortunately the message is lost in the mess. Walken gives a good performance but Black is offkey and annoying and I usually find him very funny. No, it is not a horrible film but I still cannot believe Barry Levinson Rain Man, Sleepers is responsible for this  it is not one of the worst films of all time but it could certainly be a whole lot better.

This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than the Michael Keaton piece of crap, becuz that was made too be a good movie, and that version is as bad as this.","label":0},{"index":3451,"txt":"Jack Frost, no kids it is not the warm hearted family movie about a dad who comes back from the dead in the form of a snow man. It is about a sadistic killer named Jack Frost who is sprayed with some acid fluid and is morphed into a killer snow man. I happened to catch a copy of this movie so I could have a nice sit back and laugh at it. A killer snow man? Ha, sounds like the perfect comedyhorror movie! Well I was wrong, very wrong.Jack Frost is about a killer who is being transported via truck to jail so he could fry in the chair at midnight. But it is a snowy night and it collides with a government tanker carrying a new DNA fluid. Jack escapes only to be burnt to death by the acid and morphs into a killer snowman. He returns to the small town of Snowmonton where he was caught by a small time sheriff. Here he is ready to kill again, now as a snow man with cooler powers. He can condense into water, shoot out ice cycles as spears, and grow killer fangs. The only question is, who can stop Frost? This movie is below the typical BMovie line. The movies begins cheesy but as soon as Jack is burned by the acid, it quickly drops below the cheese line and goes flat. The acting for one is appalling! Here we have a whole cast of unheard of actors who either cannot act, can act but has a pointless character, or is just here for a few extra bucks. The only good actor is Scott MacDonald who plays Jack. He looks like a young Richard Kiel combined with Frankenstein. Sadly his appearance is only reduced to three minutes and all we ever see of him is his new snow man form and his wise cracking voice. Plus his wisecracks are anything but funny. Groaning, stupid, and bad.The plot is horrible! Throughout history there have been numerous murderers. A killer in a hockey mask, a killer with a razer glove, a chainsaw wielding moron, a rapid St. Bernard, but now we stoop to a tacky killer snow man? Oh come on! And the way the characters are introduced are terrible. For one I really wanted Jack to kill the sheriffs son, I mean giving his dad oats with Antifreeze in them so they will not freeze? All the characters are dumb and pointless and the deaths are to cartoony. One woman in strangled with Christmas lights and has her head smashed into a decoration box and a girl is humped to death in the shower where is the carrot in that scene eh?.And to top of this horrible movie is the special effects. The first big special effect we have is Jacks DNA mixing in with snow and boy is it terrible. I mean it looks like a 60s fashion of art design, PU! Jack looks fake as well. He looks like a person covered with rubber snow man skin. All the blood and gore is cheesy and the film never takes off with greatness but instead stoops to low levels.Jack Frost is one of the worst slasher movies ever made. I thought it would be a riot but no! It does not try to be funny and it actually tries to be scary. Jack Frost gets 4 out of 10, it at least made me laugh from it is awfulness.

I am just not in it. Even though I did not like the movie as a whole, there were some scenes I found amusing. Such as the bathtub scene and the postexplosion scene with the Picasso reference.

I honestly thought it would be a campy horror film with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever, boy I got the cold shoulder that time. This movie was, and I am truthful, pretty damn good. It was not scary at all but the campiness and the sly humor really mad this movie interesting. Some to the horrible acting and clich\u00e9 killings were so painful to watch, I almost laughed at how bad it was, but to some extent I enjoyed it. The killings all vaguely relate to snow sports and Christmas, which made things more intriguing. The POV camera angles were awesome.The movie is about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident collision with a chemical truck while being transported to prison. He is later resurrected in that very same chemical with snow spliced into the mixture. These were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman. He than takes his revenge, as the snowman, on the police officer who convicted him.This movie had such bad acting, with the exception of Christopher Allport, that is was funny. I will say that I am also pretty disappointed that this movie was not a horror, but in fact a dark sitcom. They had a great story with a good plot but it was not executed right.

Even John Ford never made that many with so much quality. The curious thing about them all is how uneven they are. Fords My Darling Clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them. Or at least two. The real hero of them besides Mann and Stewart is Chase. Chase being responsible for the brilliant Red River. Chase wrote far country, bend of the river, and probably some others. But none of them are as finished as My Darling Clementine, but then very few films, western or otherwise are. Each of the five films of Mann have huge gaps, or is it six, lets see. Bend, Far, Man of the West, Furies, Winchester 73, and yep, six, Naked Spur. Each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene, with fairly glaring lapses. Yet so does Red River, which is still the single greatest western ever made. So perfection is not everything. But The Far Country has huge, huge holes. It is mawkish, and really comes alive only when Stewart and Mc Entire are locking horns. The rest is pretty pedestrian, with the usual exception of Manns camera. Manns camera is a one man course in cinematography. It is about as good an eye as anybody who ever got behind a strip of moving film. It is almost never in the wrong place, never. The Far Country has one amazing moment. And as usual it comes from Stewart. Nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man. He is absolutely amazing look at him in Bend, Far, Winchester, and Man from Laramie in Bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so believably and with such boiling hatred he looks like somebody displaced from Dachau, in Far he is shot off a raft with such violence, it looks so convincing that you wince, and of course when he is dragged through the fire in Man, well you find yourself looking for the burn marks. What an actor. Not to mention the moment in Winchester when he is beaten up early in the hotel room, also as well as anybody ever did it. But that was Manns territory look at Gary Cooper fighting with Jack Lord in Man of the West. As painful as any fight scene ever recorded. Cooper while not being quite as convincing as Stewart, nevertheless is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight. In short, nobody but nobody but nobody ever showed the human being in extremis as well as Mann. What a great, great director. See every western he ever made. They are his real monuments, even if all are scetchy. But so what. When he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody, including Ford. And his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone, period.Thanks, Anthony.","label":0},{"index":3455,"txt":"The 1998 Michael Keaton kiddie comedy of the same title was roundly condemned for it is, um, shoddy special effects, but compared to what Screaming Mad George cooked up for this horror comedy they are positively mindboggling.

The snowman, Jack Frost, is after the country town Sherif who put him behind bars.

This is suppose to be a sexy thriller but its not. Mostly its people talking about things followed by lots of walking from place to place and lead to lead.Periodically through out the film various people get undressed and everything has more than a touch of SM to the proceedings. The violence and fetish material is of the sort to provoke laughter rather than horror or even excitement, its all so incredibly fake. Worse there is not even enough nudity to keep it interesting.

The picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities, but the real incongruity is the major assumption on which the plot turns \u0096 that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the Canadian Yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the lawlessness. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the Yukon border with their cattle, the customs shack is empty.Where is the constable? asks Brennan.Up on the Pelly River. Trouble with the Chilkats, someone replies. He is got a real tough job, that constable. He patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles. Sometimes he do not get home for two or three months at a time. The historical truth is that the Yukon Territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state British North America has ever seen. The Northwest Mounted Police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the Klondike strike. They controlled every route into the Yukon and they brooked no nonsense. They collected customs duties, often over the wails of the new arrivals, made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation, and turned men back if they did not have enough supplies, or if they simply looked bad. In true Canadian fashion, they laid down moral laws for the community. In Dawson the Lords Day Act was strictly observed; it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on Sunday; and plump young women were arrested for what the sternfaced police called giving a risqu\u00e9 performance in the theatre, generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tights.In such a community, a gunbelt was unthinkable. One notorious bad man from Tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable, who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly. The bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman, upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over. No man has yet taken a gun away from me, said the American. Well, I am taking it, the constable said mildly and did so, without further resistance. So many revolvers were confiscated in Dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiece.In 1898, the big year of the stampede, there was not a serious crime \u0096 let alone a murder \u0096 in Dawson. The contrast with Skagway on the American side, which was a lawless town run by Soapy Smith, the Denver confidence man, was remarkable. But in The Far Country Dawson is seen as a community without any law, which a Soapy Smith character from Skagway \u0096 he is called Gannon in the picture \u0096 can easily control. In real life, one of Smiths men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a mounted police sergeant.{in the movie the lone Mountie says} Yes I am the law. I represent the law in the Yukon Territory. About fifty thousand square miles of it.Then why are not there more of you?Because yesterday this was a wilderness. We did not expect you to pour in by the thousands. Now that you are here, we will protect you.When?Therell be a post established here in Dawson early in May.What happens between now and May? You going to be here to keep order?Part of the time.What about the rest of the time?Pick yourselves a good man. Swear him in. Have him act as marshal\u0085The movie Mountie leaves and does not appear again in the picture. His astonishing suggestion \u0096 that an American town marshal, complete with tin star, be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under British jurisprudence \u0096 is accepted. Naturally they want to make Jimmy Stewart the marshal; he clearly fits the part. But Stewart is playing the role of the Loner who looks after Number One and so another man is elected to get shot. And he does. Others get shot. Even Walter Brennan gets shot. Stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own. He pins on the tin star and he and the bully, Gannon, blast away at each other in the inevitable western climax.To anybody with a passing knowledge of the Canadian north, this bald retelling of the story passes rational belief. \u0085excerpt from Hollywoods Canada, by Pierre Berton, 1975.","label":0},{"index":3466,"txt":"I used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters, but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap.

The stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement, frequent hand gestures, and offkey pacing. 2 The script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility. Oftentimes lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plot elements. 3 Shots are frequently framed in offbalance angles, poking fun at genre excesses. 4 A popeyed Jeff Goldblum delivers complex and classically preposterous dialog in a winningly sarcastic manner.The film has a guiding intelligence, deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from the Bfilms of the 1930s a secret code with a structure that would defy explanation by Carl Sagan. The films overthetop acting is used mostly for comic effect during the first 90 minutes. In an early running gag, Fay Grims son Ned is so frequently told to leave that you cannot help chuckling while feeling sorry for the lad. Parker Poseys nicely choreographed fall from bed also helps set a humorous tone early in the film.The films slow pacing does not enhance the comedy elements or the drama elements that later emerge. The films impact as drama is significantly lessened by the early comedy. Moreover, it is hard to be overly involved with the characters and their fates when the early portions of the film are so sarcastic.

Instead I got flimsy structure, goofy dialog, flabby characterizations, a convoluted plot, and a tone that shifts so often it suggests that Hartley changed the script according to his mood at any given time. I can hang for a long time with a frustrating, hardtofollow plot e.g. Duplicity because I figure that the loose ends eventually will come together. Even when they do not, or they do but they leave lingering questions e.g. Duplicity, sharp writing and acting can hold ones interest. But halfway through Fay Grim I reached a deadly realizationI did not know what was going on, and I did not care. Too bad, because I really like Parker Posey, reduced here to working with an absurd part that asked her to morph from indifferent, estranged wife and indifferent, clueless mother to tough, shrewd international player capable of psychological mano a mano with terrorists.

Then there is the sticky question of the characters ages. Goldblum was 54 when he made Fay Grim; Thomas Jay Ryan, who plays Henry Fool, was 44. Neither was made to look or seem older than their actual ages. Yet, a key point in the story is that they served as CIA agents in Nicaragua back in the 70s. Goldblums character would have been in his 20s then; Henry Fool would have been a teenager. Was Hartley being quirky or lazy? The problems are too numerous to list...","label":0},{"index":3474,"txt":"I say I would figure in that line because, frankly, I have not seen a Hal Hartley movie until now. It is not that I have not heard of him though, as he was seen as one of those small NY filmmakers when I say small I mean even smaller than Jim Jarmusch, who made ultrapersonal projects on limited budgets. In an ironic way, much as with Pasolinis Salo, though in a slightly different context, Fay Grim interests me to see some of Hartleys more acclaimed features, because there seems to be at least present some semblance of talent behind it, as if Hartley could be a very good filmmaker who may be so good he is just taken a big experimental blunder. Or, on the other hand, he could just be someone far too impressed with his own idiosyncrasies and wouldbe Godardlike cinematic collisions.I cannot quite explain the story, which may or may not be a problem I suppose, however it is not really in due to not having seen the film that preceded Fay Grim, Henry Fool. I think even if I had that experience it would not make too much of a difference based on the final results. There is a lot of international espionage, a double plot wrapped inside of another that is fallen through the fake pockets of the title character, played in an aloof way by Parker Posey not sure if that is good or bad either, maybe both, and also involving a CIA operative Jeff Goldblum, as usual a solid presence amid the mania, even conjuring some laughs, not to mention an orgyladen picture box, and author Henry Fool. It is not that the script is totally impenetrable, however much it goes into overextended loopholes just for the sake of it, because there are some touches of witty or affectingly strange dialog.Quite simply, the direction just sucks. Harltey is in love with the Third Man, which is fine, but he imposes a consistently headache inducing style of everything being tilted in angle, with characters having to get into frame equally oddly. Not since Battlefield Earth, in fact, has a director come off so annoyingly in trying to make the unnecessary choice of titled angles for some bizarre dramatic effect, only this time Hartley is not amid a clusterf, he is mostly responsible for it. This, along with the crazy wannabe Godard titlecards that pop in here and there, some a little amusing and some just totally stupid, and the montage segments all in still shots, AND a couple of moments involving action that almost call to mind Ed Wood, undermine any of the potential that is in the script, which is already fairly hard to decipher. In a way, it is fascinating to watch how bad this all goes, but a kind of fascination that comes in seeing the flipside to total creative control on a sortof smallscale story.But let it be known you will likely not come across a more wretchedly pretentious example of American independent filmmaking this year.","label":0},{"index":3475,"txt":"It is hard to believe that this is a sequel to Henry Fool.

This is no fault of the actors, who are good Parker Posey or great Jeff Goldblum  the blame lies entirely with the plot, the dialog, and even some of the filming low budget is no excuse. A huge disappointment. Sorry I could not pay attention to the plot, I was so bored, so disappointed... if you enjoyed this one you might not enjoy Henry Fool so much... the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other... there is no continuity in the characters personalities... it is all a fraud to entice fans of Henry Fool to watch the sequel.I am switching this off now  Henry in some sort of jail with a Taliban?!?!","label":0},{"index":3476,"txt":"Sorry, gave it a 1, which is the rating I give to movies on which I walk out or fall asleep.

It is from Austria, and it attempts to stumble along in the footsteps of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet scenes about various characters living in a suburban area with a dark underbelly.

Not the flabby nudity, not the cringeinducing soundtrack, not the shockless scenes involving guns. I was offended that someone actually spent money to make this when there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding. I was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see Dog Days and come out wondering if that was the best us Montrealers could find.

This is pseudosocial criticism with a sledge hammer. And it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way. It shows ugly people  that is not the reason why I hate it.

Depending on the films in question, this can be attributed to a number of things, sometimes generic special effects and plotdriven Hollywood garbage like War Of The Worlds, but in the case of overthetop, uninteresting attempts at social commentary and a desperate struggle to put art back into cinema, it is movies like Dog Days that are to blame.I normally have a very high tolerance for movies, no matter how dull or pointless I find them ranging from good, long ones like Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to ones I have considered painful to sit through a la Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West. I shut this movie off 45 minutes in, which is 30 minutes more than I actually should have. I was not interested in any of the characters whatsoever and found nothing substantial beyond a thin veil of unfocused pessimism. In an attempt to say something about the dregs of society, this film too easily falls into being selfindulgent, trite, and exploitative in a very sincere sense. Granted, I have seen many disturbing movies on the same subject, but there are so many better films out there about depressing, pathetic people Happiness, Gummo, Kids, Salo, Storytelling, Irreversible that actually contain characters of great emotional depth and personality. Dog Days had none more than an eighth graders distaste for society, choosing to ignore any true intelligence about the way people actually are, and instead choosing to be a dull, awful, and hopelessly unoriginal attempt at a work of art.

This is a much inferior copy of the original, and even as a regular kungfu movie, it is below average.First of all, this movie does not have much acting.

Unfortunately in this dimension Gone... is a flashy, vacuous, testosteronefuelled moronfest starring Nicolas Cage.For reasons not really worth getting into, he and his large number of cronies have four days to steal fifty expensive cars, only one of which has an alarm. This crew consists of the guy with the funnyshaped ears who is rumoured to be the new Superman; a guy who conducted electricity in The XFiles; an exprofessional footballer and two token black men.Their enemies are cops, rival car thieves and Bilborough from Cracker, his Manchester accent suitably flattened and broadened for American audiences who are now used to that sort of thing since Daphne in Frasier. There is also Angelina Jolie, who gets no character; save to be a receptacle to mens sexual desires. She and Cage are supposed to be old flames, which is odd, as they never have anything approaching a normal conversation in all of the films overlong 135m running time.In fact, characterisation is so poor that whenever anyone has a moment a violin plays in the background to accentuate the emotion. It is no spoiler to reveal that Vinnie Jones who recreates his famous Paul Gasgoine hand ball manoeuvre and is quite menacing when silent only gets one line; not because his inability to speak is integral to the plot but because his eloquent summing up of the films dubious morality after appearing mute the whole way through is funny. Allegedly. After he struggles through it in his notquiteactingbutit willdo London drawl, Cage quips I always thought you were from Long Island. My ribs, as you might imagine, were well and truly tickled.In fact humour is the most undeveloped aspect, from the tactless comedy policeman to the two token black characters. This sees the biggest aspect of Hollywood take hold; why is it that a black man cannot appear in a major motion picture without being constantly aware of his skin tone and endlessly refer to it? The younger man, who, like the elder, jivetalks for the whole duration, proclaims us black people do not like the cold ... we are tropical people. He then goes on to express an urge to smoke a joint and watch Roots. He is, of course, parodying the image of black people, but how funny is that? His older counterpart cannot speak without referring to himself, and thereby his colour, in third person. My black ass this, my black ass that. Does anyone know any black people who actually speak like that? Thought not.The films soundtrack is played almost nonstop and with increasing volume, some of the tracks  especially Apollo 440s Do not Stop The Rock  so loud they are actually more audible than the sound effects and dialogue. The surroundsound system even separates the two to such a degree that it makes them sound like two different films running together. No background music concept here, it is the aural equivalent of trying to watch a film while someone at the back of the cinema has their stereo turned up full blast. Keep that music down, young man!This is not the worst film in the world and in many ways I enjoyed it. It is just that it is predictable, lazy and witless, with minimal effort in its construction.

This film has NO ACTION. This film is BORING. Where are the cars? Where are the chases? Where is the tension? Where is the suspense? Where is the rush? Where!!?? This is not really a movie at all, it is a bad commercial. 50 cars in 24 hours? That is wrong. They have 3 days to steal them, the ad is wrong. How bad is that? The leads acting is stiff, wooden and forced. The villain, the cop, the others...who cares. They utter their pointless lines, they serve the illogical plot. They slog through it the best they can as the music video director says do not worry we will make a lot of fast cuts and no one will notice how bad the film is or we will fix it with lots of loud music The script is not really a script at all, it is more like a list of cliches with an ending that is a total ripoff of Warning  possible spoiler 54321 The Fugitive. The biggest crime of all is the underuse of Vinnie Jones, man....this is the baddest, coolest mofo since Jules in Pulp Fiction. And what do they do!? They make him a mute who is hardly in the film! Make Vinnie the main villain and he could have saved the film. How could they have been so dumb? How? How? Why? The original film is very entertaining with a cool trick at the end that gets the driver away. The original has a great 40 minute chase that delivers! Go find the original. Or if you are craving some real car chase action go rent RONIN. The chases in Ronin raised the bar by which all other car chases will now be judged. Bruckheimer and Cage had all that money, all those resources, all that experience, and they cannot even come close to matching a film made 25 years ago for 250,000? How can that be?

So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging out front, and the trailer coming by before MI2, expectations were rising. A Jerry Bruckheimer production. Big cars. Nic Cage and fresh from an Oscar Angelina Jolie. What can possibly go wrong? A lot. The script is neither funny which it tries really hard to be nor exciting. You put in a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and Woohhaa!! you have got comedy? I do not think so. Excitement is totally out of the picture. First of all and this is probably said many times there are no sympathetic characters so who cares who gets killed? IF you can stomach the premise that a psycho is gonna kill Nics brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, next thing you know is that Kip the brother is walking with Nic in the streets again. Is this excitement? Think not. Then comes the best bit the romance between Nic and Angelina. She actually looks bored having to utter all these stupid lines to Nic. Do you have a girlfriend? Are you seeing anybody? What went wrong? etc.Then there is only one sparkle of hope left the car chases. They are disappointing to say the least, because the trailer made it look like it was full of them, and there is only one. A very long one, caught in irritatingly hectic camera movement.

Well, now that I think about it, I guess I can see why Buster Keaton starred in this godawful episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. He would lost much of his fortune after a messy divorce in the early 1930s and his film career as a leading man was long passed as well. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed the money and loved his resurgence in popularity so he whored himself out to anyone willing to payappearing in Beach films and this mess of an episode of a great series.The biggest problem with the episode is that it is just terribly written and Buster deserved much better.

The general gist of Ron Howards adaptation is that the Grinchs bane against Christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the Whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for Cindy Lou Who played very well by Taylor Momsen. This movie makes an ardent, ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of Seuss story, but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of Chuck Jones animated version. Jim Carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish Grinch, but whether it is the dialogue, the pacing, or extraneous storylines heaped upon the initial plot, the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly. There are some wonderful visuals and the makeup work is amazing, yet beyond the technical triumphs there is an element or two here that is missing.Succinctness?Soul?Or maybe Jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25minute cartoon that Howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long. Howard, Carey, and crew are all very capable and talented, but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product.

SEUSS HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS  2000  out of fourIf you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional Dr. Seuss classic fable, do not see Dr. Seuss How the Grinch Stole Christmas. If you are old enough to read this review, then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture. It contains lots of colors, creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction, joyous load noises, and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village Whoville. Unfortunately that is where the movies positive elements end; the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for Jim Carrey to cackle on screen while giving a devilish grin, all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to do.Many people recognize the story of how the grinch stole Christmas from Whoville, so I will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read. However, I will say that the movies story is executed in three major acts; the development of the grinch and setting, the Whoville festival, and the Dr. Seuss vision of the mean one robbing the Who is from their Christmas. There are many familiar names within the credits here, but no familiar faces. Like in Battlefield Earth, I just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup and costumes. Regardless, there is SNLs Molly Shannon as Betty Lou, the wife of Bill Irwin, the later playing Lou Lou, the father of little Cindy Lou, played by Taylor Momsen. Jeffrey Tambor is the Whoville mayor, Anthony Hopkins lends his bellowing voice for the films narrator, and Christine Baranski is the Grinchs lone lost lover.The filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little Cindy Lou. The screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape; there is little if any focus by director Ron Howard and the screenplay is predictable, too extensive, and contrived. The only character given any distinctions here is the Grinch himself, all of the other characters are puppets of the plot, shapeless and uninteresting. And the dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic. ExampleGrinch Oh, the Whomanity!The movies redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer Michael Corenblith, the costume designer Rita Ryack, and the ample makeup department. How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a very goodlooking production. The sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative; it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream. The people of Whoville are plastered with makeup, to the point in which we cannot tell the actor reciting the humorless lines. Although dazzling, I really cannot give credit to the performances, for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their place.Jim Carrey is one actor who I can talk about. His performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself He is way too egotistic as the Grinch, too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of Seuss. Surprisingly, although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences, no laughs come from Jim Carrys zany silliness. It is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for Carry to overplay his part. This factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy, which is only a pale shadow of the original Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas.After this movie, historians should check the coffin of the late author, Dr. Seuss may have rolled over in his grave.","label":0},{"index":3527,"txt":"Ron Howard directed this? The 1966 cartoon is charming, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot. In this movie, Howard gives us a Whoville filled with greedy, manipulative, selfcentered Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I am sure it is not his fault; I imagine the script called for the nastiest person imaginable, so Carrey channeled Tom Green and the result is movie magic. Much like Danny Devitos Penguin in Batman Returns, Carreys Grinch is so thoroughly unlikeable that any degree of comedy that might be mined from his character simply evaporates. Where the 1966 cartoon featured a Grinch that we could all identify with, Carreys Grinch is that angry, soulless old man that we have all seen at one time or another, sitting in a parked car muttering to himself or tripping toddlers at the supermarket with his cane. This Grinch is thoroughly bereft of any degree of humanity, humor, or insight whatsoever, and his redemption at the end of the movie rings false. The whole movie rings false there is some stupid Christmas lighting competition, a failed attempt at explaining why the Grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood, and an indecipherable mystery as to why some of the Whos have that weird lip extension and some of them do not. Contrary to the 1966 cartoon, I would imagine children would find this movie tiresome, irritating, and filled with contradictory messages. Did we really need to see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives. Throw in the requisite butt jokes, fart jokes, sex jokes, and other obligatory Carreyesque lowbrow humor, and you have a movie that is about as far from the 1966 cartoon or book that inspired it as George W.

First off, following a classic act like Chuck Jones animated TV special is going to be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so heavyhanded and padded as to be positively numbing. I will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags, but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab, at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of Christmas. Jim Carrey is typically over the top here, but that is completely at odds with the character of the Grinch. As characterised by Boris Karloff, he was a slow burn; methodical and sly. There is no method to Carreys madness, and that is only the most obvious error made. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are utterly wasted here. Why, Universal, why? I mean , I understand that Tony Hopkins will take just about any role offered much like his countryman Michael Caine, but this one needs to be filed under Films that should never have been made. This does not bode well for the Cat in the Hat, an even thinner tome that Universal is prepping for this Christmas. I get the feeling that I will be making the same recommendation for that one as I am with this one skip it, and either read the book or watch the TV special.

He turned them down, insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 also in mind, perhaps, was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953s The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T. When the good Dr. died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights. But with the commonplace use of CGI effects becoming a reality, Mrs. Geisel had a change of heart. Universal made her a generous offer she accepted; she also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character. Supposedly she was satisfied with the final result. Well, Mrs. Geisel, that makes one of us.The film was given a 123,000,000 budget which is more than even Heavens Gate cost, including the adjustment for inflation, which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup, set design, and special effects which are underminedsomewhat by the rather hazy cinematography. Unfortunately, it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, which made much betteruse of a high budget turned in. Whereas the TV special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials, this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the Grinch. It turns out that, as a child, he was the subject of ridicule, including an especially humiliating experience one Christmas at the age of eight. So it turns out that everything that ails our poor Mr. Grinch is directly because of the Whos. Trouble is, it seems like a rather long 105 minutes, with too much dead wood clogging up the story. That might not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a little more...well, Grinchy. The character that Dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change and exponential growth of heart. Carreys Grinch is a loud, hyperactive oaf and, at times, a thug who, when made the holiday Cheermeister, trashes the Whoville town square in angerhopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked. This undermines the scripts attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all the Whos down in Whoville so unsympathetic at least in this interpretation.The Whoville of Dr. Seusss vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. The Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic ninnies; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism. This is offensivelyhypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from American consumerism, and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandisingcampaign.The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original. The innocent twoyearold waif who walked in on this spurious Santa is now older and wiser, constantly questioning the false values of the Whos and trying to understand the Grinchs point of view her one major scene from the original is reenacted, making it seem out of character. Sheseems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, thus making her a completely different, and more annoying, character.Those who celebrate Christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in theirstockings on the morning of December 25 than a copy of this overlong, overacted, excruciatingly tedious, hamhanded, crude attempt to turn the childrens classic into a feature film. It proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity,manipulation, and heavyhandedness are inadequate substitutes for charm, wit, sincerity, and heart.

But Cindy LouWho is curious and worried about the Grinch that lives above them and that he is not going to get as good of a Christmas as the other who is. He kicks her out and decides that he does not want Christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal Christmas all together to show the who is what his version of Christmas is all about. But soon he realizes that the who is may know that it is a little bit more than what is the materialized version of Christmas.How the Grinch Stole Christmas was not needed and was a bit over the top. I really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version, at least in my opinion. The make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done, not to mention that How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you grateful for the Boris Karloff version that is played every Christmas.110","label":0},{"index":3531,"txt":"Some have praised AtlantisThe Lost Empire as a Disney adventure for adults.

Quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest. Even a child can see the missing logic to characters behaviors. Todays kids need creative stories which would inspire them, which would make them daydream about the events. That is precisely what happened with movies like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago. How many kids imagined about becoming Jedi Knights and igniting their own lightsabers? Seriously do not waste your time  money on this one.","label":0},{"index":3535,"txt":"If the makers of Atlantis had something to say in this film, its theme was literally drowned out by the emphasis on special effects over characterization. Almost as if in an attempt to keep up with the rest of the summer action blockbusters, Disney has ditched the characterdriven, moviewithamessage approach in favor of a Star Wars shootemup with stereotype heroes and villains.The art is cartoony and the producers think that they can rely on computer generated images CGI of flying fishcraft and submarines to fill the gap. They are wrong, and the days of beautiful, handcrafted animation is fast flying out the window in favor of assemblyline CGI.This movie is all spectacle with no heart. At times the film comes close to being a good, worthwhile movie, but frustratingly misses the mark so many times by copping out of talking about something meaningful and instead choosing to go with the glitz.Another problem with the movie is the pacing. It starts confusingly and then begins to rocket along with a choppy story editing style that is not appreciated. The viewer is rushed out of the door along with Milo Thatch voiced well by Michael J. Fox and is left thinking Gee there must be an awful lot of stuff that is going to happen once we get to Atlantis. Unfortunately, not much happens. The secret of Atlantis remains a secret with the storytellers not really knowing how to explain the legendary islandcontinent. They are afraid to commit to saying where Atlantis is, even in a fictional story. Is it in the Atlantic? Is it in the Mediterranean Sea? Who knows? Nothing is hypothesized, even from a purely fantasybased point of view. The viewer will leave the theatre asking themselves Now what was that all about? What was the point of the movie? Why could not the surviving Atlanteans remember how to read when many of them lived through the disaster to the present day? And WHY did Atlantis sink? and then promptly begin to forget about what they saw. There is nothing left to think about or mill over... except the loss of money in their wallets.The characters and their motivations are equally unfathomable. From the eccentric zillionaire who founds the expedition with seemingly more money that existed on the entire planet in 1914, to the spoiler collective consciousness that enters Kida and VOLUNTARILY deserts its people!?! The crew are a collection of quirky, 2dimensional people of anachronistically for 1914 P.C. race and gender. The demolitions expert talks like he came right out of a Warner Brothers Bugs Bunny short. Most of the jokes are gross oneliners that are largely missed by the audience for two reasons They are delivered at lightningspeed pacing and usually mumbled. The way these supporting players do a moral turnaround near the end of the movie is hard to believe.While we applaud Disney for trying to create animated movies for adults  and this is the first Disney not to have cute, talking animals or objects  it fails to make the transition. Younger children will be frightened by some of the action scenes and be left in the dark by the large amount of subtitles when the characters speak Atlantean. In the first five minutes of the expedition, approximately 200 people are killed without a second thought. Obviously Disney thinks that if you did not know who those people were, then why should you care? Again, the movie has no feelings on any level.Mulan and Tarzan were the last animated movies produced by Disney that were done extremely well. Sadly, Atlantis harkens back to those failed attempts in the past such as the Black Cauldron and Hunchback of Notre Dame. Disney needs to get back to their roots. A sequel to Peter Pan is coming out shortly but one never knows what the results will be until you see it for yourself. And now that Disney has discovered Science Fiction one hopes that they will realize that that genre must have more than spectacle to it. We also hope that the upcoming Treasure Planet, a scifi adaptation of Robert L. Stevensons Treasure Island, will have more heart to it than the unfathomable Atlantis The Lost Empire.","label":0},{"index":3536,"txt":"Final Score an average of various classic cinematic qualities acting, visuals, creativity, payoff, humor, fun, ect4.3 out of 10Had Atlantis The Lost Empire come out a few years ago it would have seemed like a bold, serious new direction in Disney animation. However, it comes just a year after the innovative and nearly genius The Emperors New Groove and marks a step back in freeing Disney from it is repetative Disney Formula. I am a big fan of the feature length Disney animated films. Have to see them all love it or hate it. Atlantis is an animated throwback to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and similar liveaction scifi adventures of the 50s and 60s. Problem is that this version hardly contains one original idea. It feels like a remake of something, even more so than actual Disney remakesTarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The characters are little more than a walking cliches of the usual suspects that typically populate these type of films the oddball mechanic, the gung ho general, the sassy tough women. Beyond Milo Thatch Fox and Rourke Garner the supporting cast is flatout obnoxious. The movie also suffers from it is succinct pace. Instead of fleshing it out into an epic story, Disney jams a lot in the usually brief running time brushing over opportunities to develop...suspence, characters, anything really. They thow us into this new and wonderous world and barely let us get our barings. The awkward pace sometimes makes confusing what is a relatively simple story. The animation is dark and dreary and cheap. This thing looks like a slapped together saturday morning cartoon. Let us hope they have not forgotten that 2D traditional animation can still be wonderous.

S. Navys deepsea diver training program that is run by a racist zealot Robert DeNiro. If the program were not bad enough, it is got to be located in Bayonne, New Jersey.There is nothing wrong with the performances. Robert De Niro activates his Southern accent and shouts gibberish effectively. Cuba Gooding, raised by a stern father as a poor black farm boy in the South, is the expectable paragon of rectitude. The girls  one could hardly call them women  are Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee. They have minor roles and are mostly there to argue that their men should exercise common sense. Other decent performers  Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook  have even more perfunctory roles.That is about it. Almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer. A ship is called a boat. Robert De Niro salutes indoors, uncovered. After a brutal assault on hospital personnel, he is transferred out of his outfit instead of being busted. Somebody shouts I am outta here in the early 1950s. Maybe it was a common expression at the time. If so, my bad. People address each other by rank  Lieutenant, Boatswains Mate, Commander, as they do in the Army, whereas in the Navy they are simple Mister if an officer or addressed by their last name if enlisted. I did not bother to check if there was a rank called Senior Master Chief in 1950.Cuba Gooding has a tough row to hoe. Everyone in the Navy, it seems, hates Negroes except for one guy from Wisconsin. He stutters and is held in contempt by the others in his class. It is like the scene in Animal House, in which the applicant to a tony fraternity is asked to wait in a room with a Sikh, a black man, and a blind kid.Gooding is an enlisted man, a second class petty officer. He manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from medical school. In one of their arguments she pleads with him. She just wants to be a doctor and he should join her, quit the Navy, and lead a quiet life. And just let life pass you by?, he retorts. Yes. Yes, just be a doctors spouse and let life pass you by. You can wave to it from the golf course in Boca Raton.These kinds of flicks were common enough in World War II. Bombardier, Airial Gunner, that sort of thing. Cheap as they often were, they had some educational features. You learned something about becoming a bombardier or a gunner. Here, the technical details are skipped over, perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them except Boyles law, which we learned in highschool chemistry.I could not follow what was happening during some of the emergencies without which a movie like this would not exist. If I got the mechanical problems right, it was because I guessed correctly. The direction is no help either. The movie abounds in close ups, so many that they lose any dramatic impact they might have had. And the emergencies are confusing because they are ill focused.Why go on? Want to see a better example of this kind of movie? Almost any will do  except maybe G. I. Jane, in which the abused hero is a heroin. Try the training camp scenes in The Young Lions. There the victim is a Jew. Or try From Here to Eternity, in which no easy sympathy buttons are pushed and the victim is a grown man who refuses to bend and who is active in bringing the conflict on, just like Cool Hand Luke. No easy excuses are offered, because easy excuses are too easy.Thoroughly formulaic, and not well done.","label":0},{"index":3538,"txt":"Chinese Ghost Story III is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films.

None of the women make an impression in the film, which is regrettable, because Maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.","label":0},{"index":3544,"txt":"the writing of the journalists and the required over eager reckless press officer and sobbing grandma was hamfisted and clich\u00e9 ridden.I cant blame the actors, but surely someone must have said are you joking I cant say this!This episode had a press perspective and police perspective, while the police perspective was standard enough, the press perspective and characterization was overdrawn exaggerated and at points insultingly unbelievable.I notice that this was an HBO co production, if so then perhaps the sledgehammer stereotypes can be explained in that light,I was completely cringing during the press conference scene. it lacked any credibility and did not remotely ring true. 40 minutes into the first episode and I am still waiting for the suspense.Skip Five Daysthis. the 20089 production with these characters is far better and more suspenseful even if the crime is over the top.This story had unforgivable moments which can only be described as staggeringly unbelievable.For a press officer to start a press conference without an investigating officer present to take press questions.so unbelievable it felt like amateur hour.I then began looking for Journalists called Scoop and for Perry White to make an appearance.I saw the 2009 Hunter before five daysmade it to Australia, not realizing it was a prequel and was looking forward to Bonneville and McTeer going around again.Head shakingly awful.","label":0},{"index":3545,"txt":"I cannot believe that I wasted five hours of my life on this rubbish.

Notable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old stagers whose diction was exemplary. Do producers not listen to productions before they are aired to make sure the dialogue is audible? As a result I suppose I lost track of what was going on, and since the original plot line seemed to metamorphose into to the standard themandus thing between Muslims and the rest I soon lost interest.

On the other hand, if you enjoy British crime mysteries, following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end, you will be very disappointed.Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment  While the police utilize the CCTV cameras early on to gather clues about the mystery, the huge truck that stopped and blocked the childrens view just before her disappearance does not get caught on camera. This is a critical piece of the mystery. It is inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery. The movie goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the childrens movements but misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from cameravisible locations adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing clues. In England, driving is on the left. The director goes out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right, several meters away from the flower kiosk, when it could have easily parked immediately behind, or even on the side; as the huge truck did. The police forensics team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime, but cannot find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene, even though they secured the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfall. Search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children; this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and hunting. It is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower kiosk. It is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails for her eventual murder investigators \u0096even coaxing her daughter to do the same while she simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home. If she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails, she could of just as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential park. The suspect that abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slowdimwitted justifying his unknowingly drowning of the mother\u0097 but, he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to selfincriminate.There are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a true sleuth aficionados disappointment.

When I heard Shaggy and ScoobyDoo Get a Clue was in the works, I thought it could be better. But when I saw a pic of how Scooby and Shaggy were going to appear, I knew this show was going to be bad, if not worse. I watched a few episodes, and believe me, it is just yet another Teen Titans or Loonatics Unleashedwannabe. No longer are Scooby and Shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool, creepy monsters that rob banks. Now they are going after a typical supervillain whom wants to destroy the world. Shaggy and ScoobyDoo have become more brave, too. Also, since Shaggy IS NOT going to be a vegetarian in this series, Casey Kasem whom actually IS a vegetarian, the original voice of Shaggy, will NOT voice Shaggy. He will only voice Shaggy if he does not eat meat, and that was just a stupid corporatedone change to update the franchise, as if the Internet jokes were not enough. So Scott Menville whom previously voiced Red Herring on A Pup Named ScoobyDoo voices Shaggy here. Believe me, the voice is REALLY BAD! It makes Shaggy sound like a squeaky 10yearold, and I must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look. However, Kasem DOES voice Shaggys Uncle Albert, which is a sort of good thing. ScoobyDoo, on the other hand, does not look that well. He seems to have been designed to look more like the CGI ScoobyDoo from the liveaction movies. Also, Scoobys Frank Welker voice need I mention Brain the Dog again? still has not improved. Robi, the robotic butler, is practically worse than ScrappyDoo! He tries to be funny and does comical impressions and gives safety tips Remember kids, do not stand under trees during a thunderstorm!, but it just does not fit into a ScoobyDoo cartoon. Again, the HannaBarbera sound effects are rarely used here. However, on one episode, Lightning Strikes Twice, they use the Castle thunder thunderclaps during it, almost extensively! Although they DO still use the newlyrecorded thunder sound effects, too. ScoobyDoo has not use Castle thunder sound effects since 1991. But my question is, why use Castle thunder on Shaggy and ScoobyDoo Get a Clue, while NOT use it on the directtovideo movies or even on What is New ScoobyDoo! Two episodes of WNSD used it, and it was not enough, unfortunately. If WNSD and the DTV movies used it, then they might be better than this crappy cartoon. The day this show premiered, I watched the first episode, and it was SO bad I turned it off after only five minutes! To get my mind off of this poor show, I rented ScoobyDoo, Pirates Ahoy! which came out around the same time. And you know what? The Pirates Ahoy movie was actually BETTER than Shaggy and ScoobyDoo Get a Clue and even better than What is New, ScoobyDoo! And it looks like the new designs that the characters have is not permanent to the franchise. The directtovideo movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs, thankfully. But, whether you loved or hated What is New ScoobyDoo, I do not recommend it. But if you HATE the old series, THEN you will love it! Oh god, I hope the old ScoobyDoo cartoon stay better than this new !

But that in essence is the problem it is in it is current format so light weight that it will not have the longevity of the old Scooby and gang. I am sure it may succeed in a quick monetary return but I am sure the long term buy in of old and young is in very real danger of being lost.

Anyway, back to Get a Clue! I watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what I saw of it, I was not impressed at all. First of all, I hated the animation. It was flat, deflated and very Saturday morning cartoon standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some shows I really hate had slightly better animation. Even worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when Scooby Doo was positively good. I also hated the character changes, because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superhero, something they would have never had done in the movies or in the ScoobyDoo Where Are You? show. The theme tune was not very good either, I cannot even remember it, and the jokes were lame and contrived. Though, I do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast, had they had better material, and had not been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible, which they did, might I add.

So, what happens when you have been everywhere and done everything with the formula? You switch it up right? Wrong. You stop production and let it rest for a decade or so and then run it again, keeping the core of its success intact. That is to say, stick with the formula for the most part but add your particular flavour to it. This to me is why What is New Scooby Doo worked, they want back to the classic Scooby Doo formula which had only successfully resurfaced a decade earlier in A Pup Named Scooby Doo but for the most part had not been tapped since the original Scooby Doo Where Are You.The first sign to me of a weak offering is the inclusion of extraneous characters; there might be a few fond memories from past iterations but generally if you think Scooby Doo you are not thinking of FilmFlam, Scrappy Doo or Scooby Dum. Even worse, the exclusion of the other core members of Mystery Inc generally indicate a group of production people who do not understand from a kids point of view how the show works. The basic premise has always been a group of people who are diametrically opposed getting together and through their own individual, stereotyped qualities manage to surmount the tasks given at hand.This next paragraph is just my theorizing so skip it if you want I hope that I can explain why I think fiddling around with the basic elements of the show are detrimental with my interpretation of what the gang represents and how they contribute to the whole; Fred represents the Driver, I think in general it is the purpose of Fred to give the group direction, organization and subtasks. Fred is not a happygolucky teenager, he is your boss, your teacher, your dad, your authority figure. Fred moves without hesitation and is driven by tasks problem always equals solution for Fred. In many ways Fred is the antithesis to Shaggy. Shaggy is your best friend, that guy who is just a little more afraid of things than you are, he enables you to be brave, to not be at the back of the pack. Shaggy represents emotion and is frequently showing emotional extremes from elation to fear. Velma represents rational thought, she applies logic but as we see time and again on the show she requires clues that for the most part are collected in pieces by the other members of the show. Left on her own would Velma solve a mystery? The group often finds itself in situations where truths are not obvious and only through chance encounters do they achieve the necessary information to complete their task, chance is represented by Daphne. At one point I think it is the first Scooby Doo series she was known as danger prone. Writers have used Daphne to link unrelated events together through accident. She frequently is the one who finds the secret door, collection of objects or some other detail that can help the gang link clues together. Finally Scooby himself represents us, the participant. He is always in the centre of events, capable of all the things the rest of the gang are capable of, yet handicapped because he is not human and much like us the television viewer is unable to truly participate. Scooby Doo works because all these personified elements of problem solving are immediately identifiable and entertaining.Maybe I am over thinking things but, in my life I have seen a lot of Scooby Doo being a 30 year old selfproclaimed nerd, it kind of rolls with the territory. To me there is a magic with the classic Scooby Doo formula that should never be messed with.As many have pointed out; Scooby Doo is not a great work of art nor is it completely trite, it falls into the category of programming that can be watched by young eyes with a hearty bowl of breakfast cereal. Messing about with the raw simplicity transforms it into something else, something lesser.","label":0},{"index":3557,"txt":"Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. That is the first, most important, and most disturbing thing about this attempt at reimagining ScoobyDoo and company.Shaggys voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the Scooby shows. They have also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original.I am not sure what they are on about yet with the villain angle, but it surely is not following the formula used in any of the previous Scooby shows.And the animation style is very bizarre and distorted. I like it, but it is not real ScoobyDoo type animation. But the weird animation used for other WB shows grew on me; this might, too.It is worth a glance at  once  if you can handle the lack of proper Shaggy voice. That right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly. Besides, I am trying not to be an inflexible, nitpicking fan. Evolve or die, as the saying goes.

This new show instead features Shaggy and Scooby battling a James Bond type supervillain and his henchmen while living in a mansion. There is not even a van called The Mystery Machine and the teaser for the next episode which promised a transformers type robot car did NOT put my mind at ease.

The plot for Darkness Falls goes something like this The Tooth Fairy, a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her out of revenge. In The Tooth Fairy 2006, the disfigured Tooth Fairy who, yeah, hides her face unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone. A little too similar to be coincidence.But, what must be asked is this If you are going to directly steal the exact plot from a movie, why choose something as mediocre as Darkness Falls? Sure it made a few bucks at the box office, but that was strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered. A lowbudget, straighttovideo movie will not have that same effect. And it did not.As I watched the opening 1520 minutes of the film, my expectations actually rose. There seemed to be at least SOME production value. The story did not seem terrible, just blatantly ripped off. Past the first scene, we get an okay cast of characters including an exdoctor with secrets played by that guy who looks like a Busey and some hot veterinary student Jenifer from Argentos Masters of Horror Jenifer. After those few minutes, however, the film just slowly goes down the drain. It serves all the basic horrible clich\u00e9s including, but not limited to some crazy old person with an unheeded warning, the buff dumb jock, the psychic, and the stripper with the heartofgold.One of the biggest problems this film had was its inability to stick with a target audience. It is kind of like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on screen at the time. When the adults were on screen, it had a more mature feel. When Star the stripper and whatshisface the jock were on screen, the dialogue went down to a more stupid, err immature, level. When the kid was on screen, it felt like an episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark?. . . only less scary.Technically, the film is all over the place. The visuals range from fairly good to plain boring. The writing is subpar, as is the acting for the most part. On the plus side, there is some excessive gore at parts including a fairly cool yet painfully predictable woodchipper scene and a pretty vicious nailgun scene. Also, if you are looking for a bit of the sexy stuff, there is a brief topless scene but if you want to see this chick topless, there are better films to do that. Other than that, there is not much to bother with when it comes to this film.If you are a huge fan of Darkness Falls do those exist?, maybe you can check it out to see the story done in a different way. . . but, that is about the only reason I can find to see this one.Final Verdict 310 AP3","label":0},{"index":3560,"txt":"This movie is so stupid it simply goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous.

The second thing that came to mind was how similar this looked to another terrible movie Darkness Falls, the tale of this dumb witch who killed people in the dark. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was quite the masterpiece compared to this pile of garbage, and this movie should not have been made.The film starts off with a small back story for the witch, or, more like a pointless introduction of two little kids who are going to go meet the tooth fairy in hopes of her giving them a shiny new bicycle for their tooth. The opening is filmed poorly, and like the rest of the movie, it is certainly not scary. In present time, the movie is about Peter Lochlyn Munroe. Peters renting out his house, and his exgirlfriend Darcy Chandra West, and her daughter Cole come to stay there. Cole meets a neighborhood child, and they talk of the Tooth Fairy, and how you should not lose your tooth, or she will come for you. Unfortunately seconds later, it looks like the Tooth Fairy steals her bike and knocks her tooth out How ironic. Will Cole survive the wrath of the Tooth Fairy, and will her mother and Peter be able to save her, and rekindle their romance...this is a bad movie, you could probably figure it out.One of the main problems with this idiotic film is how undefined the Tooth Fairy is. They say she kills you if you lose your tooth, but nope. She is more like a serial killer who kills at random, and if you lose your tooth, you are definitely going to go. She steals a bike, so apparently she is a thief too. I said earlier that the idea for this movie was based on Darkness Falls, but where did they get the inspiration for the Tooth Fairys appearance? Let us see. She looks like a burn victim, and she previously went around the neighborhood slaughtering children. Hmmm...it is almost as though she is an exact ripoff of Freddy Krueger from the Nightmare on Elm Street films. And this is not the worst part of this awful mess, the climax is. This movie might have the most laughable climax Not literally laughable because I found it more sickening than funny I have ever seen. Do not see this.Just a little trivia. Lochlyn Munroe was in Scary Movie, and Jianna Ballard was in Scary Movie 3, and they both were in this, so apparently Scary Movie stars are forced to end out their career with bad scary movies.My rating 12 out of . 80 mins.

The result, Dead Above Ground, is an abysmal piece of junk. Now, had I noticed his name in association with THIS particular film I would have put it back but no, I did not have my glasses on and therefore I missed it, damn, I really do need to bring those with me while video shopping. First question would be, who the heck is the target audience for this? It is almost like a scary kids movie, but then again there is topless babes and some gore and some bad words spouted here and there. The main characters are so cute that you want to see someone, anyone, go after them with farm implements of SOME kind. Seems that a guy opens a bed and breakfast that has a checkered past, a childmurdering witch that collected childrens teeth lived there. Probably something the real estate agent failed to mention. Of course now in the modern day there is a little girls ghost around to warn the reallive little girl that now lives there that something bad is going to happen. It does, and there is also two Bubbas that were squatting on that property when the new owner took over so they are out for revenge too. This whole thing has the feel of some madeforcable junk that is for the kids at Halloween except for, of course, the things that are not suitable for little kids, so not only is this mediocre, it is confused, too. A big boo and hiss to Anchor Bay for putting this out too, considering their usual track record with fine releases this is a new low. The UK gets a Phantasm Box Set, we get The Tooth Fairy.

Although this inn has a terrible past and Pamela learns from one the girls who lives in the town that a deformed witch once reside in that house. They called her the Tooth Fairy as she would kill kids after getting their last baby tooth. This work on the inn, has awoken the Tooth Fairy. Now she has her sights on Pamela and her last baby tooth, but if any gets in the way they face the same fate that awaits Pamela.This flicks old folk myth of the Tooth Fairy does not paint her in a very generous way, as you would believe when you were a child. Do not they just love turning happy childhood memories into nightmares! Another one which did fall into the same category was Darkness Falls 2003. I cannot compare how similar they are in the premises, because I have not seen the latter, but I mostly read they have basically share the same idea. For a little straight to DVD film, this DTV effort looks good and has some promising images surrounding the senseless and traditionally by the book plot device. Low expectations are needed, as I would not class it as an success, but I found it be to marginally entertaining.Cory Strode and Cookie Rae Browns story or background for this Tooth Fairy character is completely bare with it leaning more towards a slasher vehicle than anything really supernatural. Silly is a good way to describe what is happening in this poorly scripted story, but it never really feels like a fairytale horror. The dialogues can seem rather redundant and morally hounded. While the acting is simply subpar with the bland characters they have to work off, but director Chuck Bowman offers up some inventive blood splatter and terribly nasty jolts. This kinda makes up for the lack of suspense, the zero scares and generic tone. His direction is reasonably earnest and visually able, where he gets some atmospheric lighting contrasting well with its slick photography. The promising opening scene is creepily effective. His pacing can slow up in parts and there is the odd and unnecessary slowmotion scene put in, but nonetheless it never gets too stodgy with something active occurring which made sure that I was not bored.The makeup special effects provided the goods, as there is enough repulsive gruel and the Tooth Fairys appearance is especially gooey. The figure of the tooth Fairy can look threatening in its black robe, bubbling makeup and swift movements. Being on location helps carve out a more natural feel and can get atmospherically rich in its sense of eeriness. Child actors can be incredibly annoying, but Nicole Mu\u00f1oz was decent in her part. Lochlyn Munro and Chandra West are somewhat solid, but can be a little too causal in their performances as Peter and Darcey. The radiantly gorgeous Carrie Anne Fleming is one of their lodgers. P.J Soles shows up in small part as a superstitious neighbour who tries to warn them about the evil that lurks at the inn.I thought it was a okay timewaster that has a sound concept, which just is not fleshed out enough and the execution is pretty textbook stuff. Watchable nonsense, but at the same time extremely forgettable.","label":0},{"index":3574,"txt":"The Tooth Fairy is set in a small town somewhere in Northern California where Peter Campbell Lochlyn Munro has brought a farming property which he is renovating  planning to turn into a holiday inn, he is joined by his girlfriend Darcy Wagner Chandra West  her young 12 year old daughter Pamela Nicole Munoz who arrive to help for the weekend. While exploring the property Pamela meets another young girl named Emma Jianna Ballard who warns her that evil lurks within her new home, she tells a tale of an evil old witch known as the Tooth Fairy who takes baby teeth from children  then kills them. Pamela is worried  becomes even more so when she falls off her bike  her last baby tooth falls out, it is not long before the evil ghost of the Tooth Fairy has her eyes on Pamelas tooth  just for kicks she also decides to kill anyone she comes across...Directed by Chuck Bowman I thought The Tooth Fairy was just another poor straighttovideo low budget horror film that fails to distinguish itself from the countless others which litter video shop shelves  fill late night obscure cable TV schedules, basically it is not very good. The script by producer Stephen J. Cannell, Corey Strode  Cookie Rae Brown is a complete snoozefest for the first 40 odd minutes, nothing of any great interest happen during this period at all  is basically dull exposition as if this stuff was going to surprise anyone. It introduces the characters, sets the Tooth Fairy legend up  that is it. The second half of the film improves slightly but even then it is hardly spectacular stuff, there are a few decent setpiece gore scenes but apart from that it is all very predictable  forgettable stuff. The characters are not great  most of them are there purely to be killed off, the story has inconsistencies like the story of the Tooth Fairy herself, it says she kills children after they give her their baby teeth so why does she go on an indiscriminate killing spree that has nothing to do with teeth? What happened to her after the prologue set during 1949? Why has she come back as a ghost? Despite being a ghost of some sort she seems very human having to open doors herself  using weapons to kill people, there is no attempt to make any use of the supernatural elements except the ghostly children who are played for maximum sentiment.Director Bowman does OK, it is reasonably well made  there are a couple of half decent scenes but nothing to get that excited about. There is nothing I would describe as scary or atmospheric in here  do not take any notice of the comparisons between this  Darkness Falls 2003 as besides the teeth thing they are quite different. The gore is OK, someone is shoved into a woodchipping machine, there is a decapitation, someone has their penis chopped off  the best scene when someone is nailed to a door  then has their stomach hacked open with an axe  their guts slide out.With a supposed budget of about 1,500,000 The Tooth Fairy is generally well made but there is nothing special on show here. The acting is not anything great but it is not too bad  unusually I did not find the child actors that annoying so that is something I suppose.The Tooth Fairy is the usual just below average low budget modern straighttovideo horror fare that seems everywhere these days, if you can find a cheap copy then it might pass 90 odd minutes if your not too demanding otherwise it is pretty poor  forgettable stuff.","label":0},{"index":3575,"txt":"Just saw this film and I must say that although there was shown in the beginning some effort to produce a decent film, this was absolutely horrible  but not in the sense that was intended I am sure.It was like a child was directing this insult to intelligence with the belief that all wouldbe viewers are morons OR extremely hard up for entertainment OR both.... Thank God for fast forward! I cannot imagine the type of viewer the producer had in mind when making this film.

Wenderss introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly  alluding to worlds culture or actually, American culture traveling in space, but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid.

To do this, she reassembles the titular Gang of Roses supposedly based on a true story of a female gang and they go out and exact revenge and, along the way, there is some subplot or something or other about some gold that might be buried in the town.

It is the kind of thing the show could do with more of, but it seems all too often to flatten every potentially emotional, inspiring or exciting moment under it is relentlessly lowkey direction.Unfortunately Francesco Quinn makes a staggeringly anonymous hero, blending in with the walls and coming over less as a Roman officer than that quiet, slightly gormless but inoffensive guy who works in the same office as you who never says much at office parties  you know, the one who you think is called Dave or something like that. The budgetary limitations are very visible once its Meet the Lions time for the Christians and Ursus battle with the bull is so determinedly low key that it just passes over you before the show just abruptly loses interest and suddenly ends.Not a trip I can particularly recommend, I am afraid, but if you do embark on it it is one not entirely without its small rewards.","label":0},{"index":3603,"txt":"This film, originally released at Christmas, 1940, was long thought lost.

I played the innocent philanderer Jimmy Smith onstage in 1974, and thought this 1 DVD would bring back memories. Not a chance. Even the anticipated delight of seeing Topper Roland Young play my part was a major disappointment. Three songs from the play remain, and are done very poorly. Even the classic duet, Tea For Two, is done as a virtual solo. The many familiar faces in this 1940 fiasco do not do themselves proud at all, and the star, Anna Neagle, just embarrasses herself. When I feel gypped by spending a dollar, I know the film must be bad.

A great number of fine character actors appear in this film Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden, but the material falls remarkably short of their talents. Still, it is interesting to see how such accomplished performers make the most of the weak writing. The musical numbers there are really only two are quite horrible.

But of coarse from the soundtrack I had no idea what the film was about. So the other day I saw a copy of it at the video store and I rented what was supposed to be a long lost version of the film. I was thinking that it was going to be amazing, because the soundtrack is so cute. Unfortunately most of the songs that I loved were nowhere to be found in the video I saw. Now I have never seen the 1930 version of the musical but this version was sadly disappointing because there was very little singing and practically no dancing and beside that the sound was really bad through out and you could not really understand what people were saying a lot of the time. Really the only highlights of this film were the outrageous 1940s fashion. Nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that stick out like rabbit ears and Kansas Kitty has this bizarre feather muff that she keeps on her fore arm and then has herself wrapped in this net scarf. The one dance sequence is a little weird too with Nanette doing this weird ballet stuff with pinup girl imagery superimposed on top of her. Actually one more bright spot of the film was the artist Guillespe who dreams of being a fine artist but it currently condemned to drawing pinup girls for money. I like how Guillespe keeps it old school, and disses Nanette when his masterpiece, the piece that was to make his career, is sold by Nanette for a paltry 5250.

It is about a hit man, my friend said. Well. . . and it is Brazilian, I added. Beautiful multicolored people, tropical weather, lush rhythms, and a hip gangster plot? Ample enticements no doubt.Somebody forgot to tell us one little detail this is a very bad movie, really pretty horrible, and as unpleasant to watch as it is poorly made.So how on earth did Contra Todos get to make the rounds of Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, numerous smaller local festivals, and now San Francisco? Apparently, because of the way the promotional process and the film festival circuit work.First of all, it won first prize at the Rio Film Festival where it was called the best Brazilian movie of the year. It must have been a bad year; they have had much, much better ones. Next, snappy synopses in catalogs plus imaginary buzz lead to crowded auditoriums and  since the movie is not featured anywhere and so avoids close scrutiny by critics  it keeps going the rounds.Festival blurbs aimed at promotion sometimes goose it up a lot. A Chicago Festival one called Contra Todos a speedball cocktail shot straight out of Brazil and referred to Claudias s boyfriend as the stud of the slumlike neighborhood. Soninha is Teodoros nymphlike teenaged daughter of burgeoning sexuality. The movie is shot with the urgency of a frequently handheld camera and the director works up a genuine and palpable sense of frustration borne from domestic desperation and decay. The effect is  unbearably raw and honest, and the movie hurtles toward a conclusion as deadended as the lives on display. Not the best writing, but it sure pumps up the excitement for a certain kind of potential viewer.Contra Todos does concern a hit man, two hit men actually, and a wife and daughter and a bornagain Christian girlfriend. It is shot  in execrably ugly digital video with no talent behind the camerawork  mostly in a barrenlooking poor suburb rather than in one of the teeming favelas or villagelike Brazilian city slums where such wonderful films as Black Orpheus, Pixote, and City of God were made, and not in Rio this time, but S\u00e3o Paulo.The hit man with family problems is Teodoro  Giulio Lopez and his partner with a drug problem is Waldomiro Ailtan Gra\u00e7a. Both actors have a little TV experience as does the actress who plays Teodoros sluttish blonde wife Cl\u00e1udia Leona Cavalli and Silvia Loren\u00e7o who plays his pouting, readytorevolt daughter Soninha. These actors might make it through the back corners of a few telenovelas. Who knows?  in a better directed film they might even be good. Aside from them there are some young men who get bumped off by Teordoro or, when he is busy, gangs of thugs. The principals do not work up much presence, even though the camera magnifies their pores.A couple of observers, one at the Berlin Festival and one at Londons, did see this movies failings but alas they are buried in the Web hinterlands. Henry Sheehan noted from Berlin that the film his quotes was the worst of the video works shown. The filmmaker seems to have chosen video simply because it was a cheap alternative to film, Sheehan wrote, and has not made any creative use of the new medium  nor, he adds, done anything else creative.Sheehan pointed out the movies first big mistake it starts off as a domestic drama that is supposed to ratchet up when, half an hour into the action, Moreira reveals that the father and one of his friends are professional hit men. Waiting the thirty minutes adds nothing to the movie; it seems like a perfectly arbitrary decision and is, at the very least, a waste of time. But ratcheting up is all Moreira ever does, like a little kid who is gotten a tool kit for his birthday, and goes around banging everything in sight without rhyme, reason or skill. Devastating, but true.Writing about the 2004 London festival for Kamera.com, Metin Alsanjak tried to look at the positive side but nonetheless gave away the lack of redeeming features in calling the performances easily the films best feature. Yes, very easily, given that everything else is so bad. Alsanjak admitted that  this lowbudget, violent and seedy account of the lawless in Sao Paulo is devoid of any likable characters, and as a result, of hope. Too dark and cynical to be a telling account of the human condition, the film is not helped by poor subtitling.. . Alsanjaks connecting Contra Todos to Dogme and Mike Leigh did not help matters.Apart from that meaningless first half hour in which nothing redeems the boredom of our wait for the first acts of violence  which, when they come, are just banging everything in sight without rhyme, reason or skill  Moreira clumsily tries to redeem his abrupt finale by adding what appear to be outtakes right after it, followed by an implausible ironic concluding scene where one of the characters gets married. No doubt the director wanted to exhibit the banality of evil of lowlevel hit men in working class neighborhoods, but he cannot make the characters, which he sees generically, come alive for us. And the structure of the film shows that he also cannot edit his material.

I did not enjoy the movie that much, and it clarifies something that I did not see before that the visual elements can be the defining positive aspect of a film, but without a good story and strong characters, it can all be for nothing. I will not go so far as to say that this movie comes to nothing, but sometimes it comes dangerously close. I love Dark scifi thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two films I thought were wonderful. But Blade Runner had its tragic villain and Dark City had its thoughtprovoking story arc. Renaissance has shadow and light, but little else. I wish I could have liked this movie more, but the weak story and the empty characters stood in the way of that.

In fact it is so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it as soon as it was built.I am not crazy about horror genre books, but this one was hard to put down when I came across it around ten years ago. The main characters are not the kind of people to look for anything occult in life, and this is one of the books strengths. They are not people who would conclude that the architect was some type of demon..or the devil personified without witnessing and analyzing the events described so well in the book.

You know that when the critical moments precede the commercials, which of course, one cannot find in this version we watched.The films star is Lara Flynn Boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through. From the new eyebrows to other parts of her body, Ms. Boyle is hardly recognizable as Col Kennedy, the character at the center of the mystery. This was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera. That goes for the rest of the mainly Canadian actors that deserved better.The film has a feeling of a cross between Desperate Houswives with The Stepford Wives and other better known features, combined with a mild dose of creepiness.

I kept staring at them. They look so out of place on her face! They make her look completely different and not better.MarkPaul Gosselaar, the actor who plays Kim the architect who designs and pours his heart and soul into the house, does a fine job. And Lara as Col is also quite good but those lips! as the owner of the house next door. Her husband, Walker Colin Ferguson is appropriately wooden. The various characters who live in the house were also fine. I particularly liked Pie Charlotte Sullivan and her husband, Buddy Stephen Amell, the first people to move into the house. The attempt to involve us in the overall neighborhood vibe fails, unfortunately, as the other neighbors are not particularly likable.For some reason the director was unable to make the haunted house particularly ominous. Other movies such as Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House manage to achieve that spooky feel, but it just does not happen here. The closest is when Col paints a depiction of the house.Another thing that did not work for me is the plot twist that occurs with Kim, the architect. Initially, he appears to be a victim of the house like the others it has sucked him dry of inspiration, but later he seems to have joined forces with it in evil.Overall, not a bad movie for horror fans if you can take your eyes off those big lips!","label":0},{"index":3622,"txt":"That reviewers liked this movie surprises me.

Such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for; but to be effective they must also be entertaining. Unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read; whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round. The first such work to become really widely known was probably George Orwells 1984 first published in 1948, and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a film.Watch or read it and then, when you are feeling a little depressed by mans inhumanity to man, reach for Cinderella 2000. This is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing; and as with 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period. Most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments. To exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a DVD or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption. There are many worse films appearing as DVDs these days, and frankly I do not care much what happens either way.So far the best of the films of this genre has probably been The Handmaidens Tale, but I would very happily swap them all for a well made film of Jack Londons towering novel The Iron Heel.

She has a love scene with Anthony John Denison and also has a shower scene  shot at a distance.STORY  We have seen this plot before  a hundred times over, and oftentimes done much better. The true culprit, when trying to decipher why this film was a dud, is William Riead. The mans dialogue is sophomoric and moronic. The man has no storytelling abilities and fails to build believable human reactions to the plot. These people, of the upper strata of society, talk like middle school kids  with a habit of sleeping during English class. I have placed Riead on the NevertobeViewedAgain list.ACTING  The acting was not phonedin as the insiders say, but was hindered a great deal by Rieads juvenile script. Olivia Hussey resorts to calling Anthony Jonh Denison weird and crazy to his face when he begins to stalk her. Hussey, who is still beautiful, delivers the best performance here but Denison was equal to the task of portraying a demented, lovecrazed stalker. Don Murray was basically just there  his character not fleshed out, and Edward Asner, a terrific actor when given something with substance, is illused in this film.","label":0},{"index":3632,"txt":"Oh man, this sucked sucked....

A contestant is given the beginning of a phrase, such as Which team lost . . . with three choices, A, B, or C, each which completes the phrase. The contestant has three chances to give an answer to one of these 3 choices. The host  William Shatner, at his obnoxious smarmiest  asks the contestant if he wants to lock into the answer and when the contestant says yes, he picks a dancer, to whom he yells Show me the money! She opens a scroll that has an amount, and if his answer was right, he adds that amount to his winnings; if he was wrong, the amount is subtracted. So theoretically, it is possible for a contestant on this dreary debacle to actually wind up owing Shatner money. There is also a Killer Card and if the contestant picks the girl who has that vile scroll, but he has answered properly, nothing happens. If he is answered wrong, the game goes into Sudden Death and has to answer another question. If he gets that one wrong, he leaves with nothing.Before going to commercials, Shatner yells, let us dance and Shatner, the contestant and the 12 dancers shake booty.

As Ben Stein so stoically and nasally says, wooww.The only thing likable about this show was the fact that you knew it would eventually be over. Sitting through a full hour of it was like going to the dentist...you find yourself looking at the clock in what you think are 10 minute intervals, only to find out that only a minute has passed but seemed like an eternity since you last glanced at the clock.

When a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer, you can rest assured that absolutely nothing exciting will happen in the next few minutes. It would greatly help the pace of this show to reveal the correct answer FIRST, and THEN have the player select a dancer, instead of Shat wasting time talking about what will happen if the player gets an answer wrong when we all know they are right.

Too much time is wasted while not enough is happening... and the fact that players cannot choose to quit the game early guarantees that there WILL be a lot of time wasted.Oh, and I have NO interest in watching Shat shake his groove thang, especially right after I have eaten dinner.I am a lifelong game show fan, but even I had a lot of trouble sitting through an hour of this.

You had the always entertaining William Shatner as your host, surrounded by a bakers dozen of beautiful leggy models collectively called The Million Dollar Dancers. You had knowledgeable contestants who had interesting stories to tell of their lives and who presumably knew a lot of pop culture trivia. And you had big money! So, what went wrong? The format of this game was the failure. A good game show needs at least two of three things very simple rules, exciting pacing and the ability for the viewer to play along at home. The best, most enduring ones have all three.Unfortunately, SMTM had none.The rules for this game were among the most complex of any prime time game show in history. Let me try to explain how the game worked, as briefly as possible.A contestant began with a single word or short phrase followed by the choice letters A, B, C subtle plug for the network?. Each letter was connected to a separate question, all starting with that word or phrase. Once a contestant chose one of the letters, they could either answer that question or pass and select a second letter. If they passed, they got to view the next question, and had the same option. However, if they passed the second question, they were required to answer the third option.After they answered and before they found out if their answer was correct, they then had to select one of the 13 dancers on stage, each with a different amount of money in a scroll by their side. They revealed their dollar amount ranging from 20,000 to 250,000 and depending on if the contestant answered right... or answered wrong... that amount would be added to or subtracted from their pot.Still with me so far? In addition, there was one dancer who held something known as The Killer Card. If you selected the dancer with the Killer Card and you had gotten your question right, you were safe, and the game continued. If, however, you were incorrect, you had one final question to answer. If you got that final question wrong, you were out of the game. If you got it right, then, the game continued.There was no quitting, no walking away with the money earned until you either answered six questions correctly or got six questions wrong or you were so far in the hole you could not earn enough money to get back out. Got it? Okay! The biggest problem, as I saw it, was a complete lack of tension, because of the design of the game. A contestant could pass questions they knew they did not know, and answer many questions they did know, making the pressure even less. Then, they could still find a low dollar amount, even after knowingly missing a question, which meant there still was not any drama. And the fact that they could answer five questions wrong and still have a chance to win was a big mistake. And the pacing of the questions was deadly slow often the questions were so obvious, it was ridiculous to try to create tension, as if there was any doubt about some of the most common answers.The pacing, the lack of any real tension at any point during the show and those very complicated rules prevented this program from working, despite Shatners terpsichorean talents.","label":0},{"index":3643,"txt":"I do not see enough TV game shows to understand the attraction of SHOW ME THE MONEY, but I suppose it holds some appeal for undemanding audiences. Ostensibly a quiz show, it offers contestants huge sums of money for answering a few simple questions. However, its quiz elements play only a small part in the proceedings, which I find tortuously complicated. For example, before answering a question, a contestant selects which question is to be asked by choosing from among random A, B, or C choices. Does this serve any purpose other than to slow the game down? It would be a lot quicker simply to start with A. Contestants can pass on questions, but must answer one of the three questions in each category.After responding to a question, the contestant is then asked to lock in the answeranother delaying tactic. The contestants next task is to name which woman from about a dozen gogo dancers in cages is to unveil a card that indicates how much the question is worth. A correct answer adds the cards dollar figure to the contestants running total; a wrong answer subtracts the same sum. This timeconsuming step actually has some entertainment value, as it allows the audience to get a close look at the scantily clad and uniformly gorgeous dancers. Meanwhile, the contestant is reminded that an unlucky selection of the killer card will end the game instantly. This naturally makes the contestant sweat and causes further delays as the nervous contestant contemplates the sudden loss of the hundreds of thousands of dollars. My suspicion is that the possibility of sudden disaster is the show is chief audience appeal.Meanwhile, the whole process is slowed down even more by a lot of empty banter between host William Shatner and the contestant, along with occasional routines by the caged dancers. All these delays burn up so much time that it might be possible for audiences to forget what the original question is by the time the correct answer is revealed.A typical 30minute episode of JEOPARDY often gets through as many as 60 questions. The first 30 minutes of SMTM that I watched got through only six questions many of which pertained to other TV shows. No one in his right mind would watch this show because it is fun to play along by answering the questions at home. That leaves three possible reasons to watch the show.A. To see how a contestant responds to being on the verge of winning as much as one million dollars, only to lose everything in one stroke.B. To look at gorgeous young women performing sexually suggestive dance routines.C. To enjoy William Shatners scintillating banter.My choice is B, but the women are not on camera long enough to justify suffering through an hour of this show.","label":0},{"index":3644,"txt":"That is not the sound of bees, that is the effect induced by watching this extremely long, extremely boring, badly acted movie.

But the guy is funny.The girls who are in the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls, will be pretty much outofluck when this turkey is canceled  unless there is a revival of the whiskeyagogo genre, with a resurrected demand for shapely young women to dance in elevated cages once more.I watched the first contestant, who was annoying, and literally dumber than a post, yet through sheer luck, walked away with a quarter mil or so. The second contestant, somewhat more intelligent, but whod be lucky to gain 1,000 on Jeopardy!, got zonked by the card which requires answering a special question  which he did not know, and thereby left with zilch.This plethora of game shows, which dangle, and sometimes award, large sums to everyday individuals, are admittedly a cheap effort, overall, to attempt to woo viewers. Even if the host is wellcompensated, and they give away six figures in an average episode, I suppose that the revenue versus costs can be favorable  since you do not have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures, per episode, with some big residual deals as well.But I suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long.

As I said, it has a definite made directly to video look about it. It also has narration and acting that just scream unprofessionalshow could this be?! The film is filled with lots of corpses and blood. Normally this would turn me off completely, as I hate ultraviolent films and do not like seeing all that gore. However, given that none of it is that realistic, it is bearable. However, I should warn you that there are a few scenes that are still pretty disturbing. For example, the scene with the kid throwing a radio into a ladys tub and watching her naked and frying is pretty bad. There are also scenes where you can hear the thought of psychos as they fantasize about killing women. With a level of misogyny that is pretty awful. the people who wrote this are pretty sicklike killing women is meant to be for our entertainment.After a bunch of senseless murders, the film goes to a dining room tablearound which are a bunch of goofballs wearing black hoods WITHOUT eye holes!

While they tried to act like Americans and the film was supposed to be in California, the accents are STRONG. Perhaps German audiences watched this and marveled at how realistic the acting was, but to any American it is obvious these folks as not their fellow Americans!

I was also heavily disappointed that all the killings were done with a gun what kind of gore is that. That is not a copycat the Zodiac did not kill using just a gun the authorities would have known it was not him. Another thing that really bothered me was that they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4 when that is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders not the name of the disorder. Overall I think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done with a low budget at least not as low as they had or they could have made sure they had better actors or more gore.

La Maman et La Putain has surely passed into history as an influence on much of what is been done in France and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film, certainly, should be dissuaded from watching it. To express a purely subjective judgement, however, I feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people Do not watch it; it is a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry. And by that I do not mean sick and angry about the human condition or anything so general and profound as that, because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film  an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty and so on  and, if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort, then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself, however pessimistic his conclusions may be. My beef with the film is rather that I do not see this hourslong record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any GENERALLY relevant message at all. All three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals Alexandre to the greatest degree, of course, because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds; Marie perhaps to the least degree, because we see the least of her. Alexandres affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value, of course, but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that JeanPierre L\u00e9aud is most likely not even acting and that, with absurd remarks like un homme beau comme un film de Nicholas Ray, he really was just reproducing wordforword opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he, along with the director Eustache, had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film. I suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout 100 of the film, it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow, worthless and despicable post68 milieu. What made, however, this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to Alexandre and Veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us. If a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman, sleeping mostly in this very flat with another, and running around Paris proposing marriage to yet a third, well, I suppose I can wish him the best of luck in the dogeatdog world he is chosen to create for himself. What I cannot, however, in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his anxiety and his despair. The same goes double for the even more despicable Veronika, whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by Marie and Alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty. As I say, if La Maman et La Putain is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of Alexandre, Veronika and Marie, three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home, then I suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being unflinching though why one should even feel like flinching once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe I cannot imagine. The problem, however, is that the director is clearly convinced  and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics  that Alexander, Veronika and Marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings emotional capabilities. This latter idea, however, is arrant and offensive nonsense. There may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular. But the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work. It surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like Alexandre is going to end up hated, miserable, and alone, or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like Alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter. Watch La Maman et La Putain if you are historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post68 Parisian milieu which was probably, unfortunately, not restricted to just a few particularly antisocial types like these.

On the box it says from the director of the boogeyman so I figured...eh whatever, if this was made recently I am sure the directing at least will not be TOO bad \\, but after I saw the movie and looked at what boogeyman they were talking about, it is some nonsense from the early 1980s that he made. Great way to rope in unsuspecting viewers.ANYWAY, I think that they just liked the name Zodiac Killer, and did not bother to research any of the actual Zodiacs crimes or his MO, or even the years that he was active. All of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the Zodiac and the stories about the original Zodiac take place several years after the actual Zodiacs crimes did. They also compare the Zodiac to Vampire of Dusseldorf Fritz Haarman throughout the movie and talk to Fritzs son quite often. The Zodiac and Haarman were nothing alike, and it makes more sense to compare him to BTK who also shot people, not a man who killed people by chewing through their necks. None of the Haarman facts are correct either, just a bunch of jumbled nonsense. His son even says Do not forget, his name was Fritz Haarman with 2 ts...His actual name just has one! I think that the writerdirector simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest ones that came up were the Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman. Ooh those sound like cool names, let us make a movie about them without doing any outside research! great idea!Perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from DSMIV and getting cured of it. I was also diagnosed with DSMIV and have since recovered, etc. For those of you who do not know, DSMIV is the psychological manual for mental disorders. If anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some SERIOUS problems! Haha.Anyway, my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time list, and it is rare that a movie ever reaches that point. But, if you are interested in watching a totally nonfact based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring, full of inexperienced actors, and not completely rational, I would say check out this movie....Oh, and I liked how the killer tear gassed a few of his victims with dry ice. Nice touch...","label":0},{"index":3657,"txt":"Well I will start with the good points. The movie was only 86 minutes long, and some of it was so bad it was funny. Now for the low points. My first warning sign came with an actual warning on the film. When it started the following warning was displayed The film you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images. Because contrary to popular belief being killed is neither fun, pretty or romantic. I should have saved myself the 86 minutes and turned it off then. The first words of the film were I am at the glue factory. It was some guy talking on his phone, and he was referring to a nursing home as a glue factory. I do not know why. So the basis of the movie is some kid is obsessed with the Zodiac Killer and starts imitating him. The budget for this film was at least 50 bucks and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find. The acting was worse than me reading straight from a script. That is what is looked like they were doing. The script was horrible, and the big twist was that this guy who wrote a biography on the Zodiac Killer was actually the Zodiac Killer. Of course they tried to show this subtly but made it totally obvious within the first 10 minutes. Without any more painful details of the plot, here were some horrible highlights of the movie. They try to make the Zodiac Killer compare himself to an army of one because soldiers are really just murderers. Then they tried to make an attempt at Satanic Worship by showing some guys in black hoods in a meeting. The great computer hacker was able to get this kids address when someone gave him the kids name and phone number. For some reason he had to hack into the FBI to get someone address. I am not sure why he did not just look it up in the phone book or use whitepages.com. There was also a random allusion to 911 for no reason. I also learned that no matter where you get shot, blood will come out of your mouth within seconds.So if you like really bad acting, subpar scripts, bad camera work and an obvious plot, you will love Zodiac Killer!","label":0},{"index":3658,"txt":"Zodiac Killer. 1 out of 10.

There is a recent trend among young filmmakers of utilizing digital video for their early projects, which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock. But many of these young filmmakers have also wised up to the notion of filtering the finished movie so that it appears qualitatively more like celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really only works for the mockumentary style, because it never looks like anything other than video. Therein lies the primary trouble with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer. It does not feel like watching a movie. And what is even more unforgivable is that the Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker. He ought to know better. He ought to know that it is virtually impossible to generate horror or even suspense! on video. For the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties! He may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business. And lucky us, he wrote the script too!

I really like the show but mainly due to the cast and the 3 or so good episodes each year but who ever is on the writing cast that works or used to work on the soaps needs to be canned. This was by far one of the worst. With in the first 4 minutes you know that what is going on is bogus and anything happening is a dream based on Clarks infliction obviously caused by a phantom zone character and when he wakes up he will win and blah blah blah so the writers do not have to really create a villain that will progress the story line any this week.

Capote coined the phrase nonfiction novel to describe the book on which this film is based, and the spirit of that form was carried over into the film script, which he cowrote. Despite the fact that we were well into the era of color film, Richard Brooks elected to present this film in black and white to underscore both the starkness of the landscape and the bleakness of the story. This is the first problem with the TV remake color changes the tone of the story. In addition, the confinement of shooting a film for TV makes reduces the options of how the shots are framed and focused. As a result, we lose the dramatic clash which makes the second part of the original film police interviews, trial, imprisonment, and execution so claustrophobic. On the small screen, it is just another version of Law and Order spinoffs. Hollywoods search for scripts continuously takes it back to movies that were successful in another age. Usually, that is a mistake, and this is no exception.All of the actors are competent. The script is OK. The directing does not get in the way. It is just that the movie does not work as well as the original precision instrument. It does not hook the viewer into the ambivalence toward Smith and Hickock that the original film provokes.

Not that the dancing man sequence is that great either  it definitely has its moments of not being clever as Shapiro desperately tries to fill in the time for the entire song  but it actually was somewhat watchable.

As Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful.

I have always considered this the worst STTNG episode with the exception of Shades of Gray, which barely counts as an episode at all.I keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script redpenciled by the authors Writing 101 teacher SHOW, Do not TELL! From Deanna Trois pronouncement, and everyone elses constant elbowing reminders about what a charming, dangerous rogue Okona is, to Guinans explanation about how funny her droid joke is it is not, to the whocares resolution to the conflict, there is not a plot point that is not highlighted and tripleunderlined for our edification, and there as not a believable moment in any of it. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is too puppydog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot. On the other hand, it could be that no one short of John Barrowman Jack Harkness from Doctor Who could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role.Zero points, by the way, to the Data subplot. While I think Joe Piscopo stopped being funny decades ago, he and Brent Spiner had nothing to work with here.

On this account, however, I was sadly disappointed. I found the jokes predictable apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war and the characters completely onedimensional.

I was never eager to see this film after I saw the ads for it, I ended up seeing it only by chance because some friends of mine had tickets and had one spare so I tagged along. Before seeing it I had a fairly good idea that it would not be genius  the premise seemed far too silly and stupid for anything good to come out of it, but at the back of my mind I was thinking but there must be something good about it for UMA THURMAN and Luke Wilson do to the film... not that I think either of them are particularly terrific but they are bignamed stars who would normally only do films that would enhance their reputations. However, about 1020 minutes into the feature I realized that the movie was probably worse than I had at first anticipated. I was shocked at how terrible the script was. It really gave the actors NOTHING to work with, so much so that they really looked like they did not know what they were doing especially Luke Wilson. The story was completely predictable  if you have seen the ad then you have pretty much seen the movie! And there was nothing original about it  it pretty much borrows from every superhero story that has ever been which would be acceptable had the film been set up as a satire of that genre, but alas it was not. The direction seemed to be of realism. I got the feeling that the director wanted the film to feel completely realistic and not satire at all, and yet there were some moments in the film that were so unbelievably unrealistic that it would have worked if it were a satire. At one moment in the movie two of the characters seem to die and one of the surviving characters has a line like Oh well, she is dead...time to move on and he says it in such a droll voice that it completely did not make any sense. I found myself checking my watch after about 40 minutes to see how much longer I would have to sit through it. And then it struck me...I began to think I wonder if the studio have made this picture as a test to see if they can make the worst possible movie ever made, and still pull a large audience... I could not think of any other reason why this film would be made. For movies to be made these days, the script goes to a massive screening process and very very few scripts actually make it to the production stage...I cannot comprehend how this one got past the first draft stage... By the end, and exceedingly, dumbfoundingLy stupid climax, I was laughing heartily  just not at what the filmmakers wanted me to laugh at, but instead at how ridiculous and stupid the movie was. Thank God I did not have to pay money to see it...because that would have really annoyed me!!! Oh, and could I just add, that of the two Wilson brothers, I have always preferred Luke because I think he is a better, more versatile actor...but if he wants to step even further into OWENs shadow then this is exactly the way to do it...I doubt that he will get many more job offers after this crappy waste of 2 hours!!! and remember, it only got a generous 110 because I could not select 0!","label":0},{"index":3694,"txt":"I have to admit when I went to see this movie, I did not really have high expectations. But even with my low expectations I was totally and utterly disappointed...Basically Luke Wilson is a hot shot who tends to go out with slightly crazy girlfriends. There is slight mention of a girl stalking him but that is pretty much it for that character. Which i do not quite mind cause it would probably be just as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie.So while on a subway Rainn Wilson who i actually liked before this movie convinces him to talk to a hot girl, Uma Thurman. This is strange to say the least, as everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman does not belong under the category of hot.Rainn Wilsons performance is also far from hot. Normally I am all for his acting, but even he could not salvage this movie. His character was jumpy, unrealistic and rather annoying. You could never tell if the writers were trying to make him the comical token closet gay guy, or just desperate. It was almost painful.But anyway, someone steals her purse as she goes to leave the subway, and Luke Wilson being the charming savior he is runs after the robber. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is the superhero, or GGirl as they like to call her in the movie. It still baffles me as to what the G stands for, but we will leave that for the message boards to debate.The sex scenes I assume are supposed to be funny, but I find myself asking who has sex like that? They nearly throw the bed through the wall because of Uma Thurmans passion let us say. It makes my head hurt, but not in the I am thinking really hard to understand this way.When Uma insults Anna Faris, calling her a whore I had no debate with that. Apart from the fact that she cannot choose movies properly, she cannot act and relies souly on the fact that she is blonde and typical.Overall I would have walked out of the theater if i had not paid 8.75 to see it. The characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry, especially Uma Thurman. Someone should let her know that just because you move your head a lot does not mean you are acting.Also, the script and storyline could have used either a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid. I actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors, and their dying careers.

Thurmans early performances in films like Henry  June and Jennifer 8 showcased an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic poise; her films with Quentin Tarantino helped expose her sinewy hardness and intensity, but that came at a price the actress has seemingly lost her graceful touch. The picture is exceedingly wellproduced and shot, with expensiveseeming special effects, yet nobody bothered to find the humor in this scenario. It is pushy, leering, ugly, and badlycast.

And when the effects people apparently could not master the superheros fasterthanaspeedingbullet flying or fight scenes, they covered over everything with a swirling vortex of blurred screen  which hid the awful effects quite nicely.

It was at that point when I gave up, realizing I could not care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truck.The last time the movie was interesting was when Luke Wilson climbs out of the dumpster, hair dryer in hand, and first meets the heroine, Uma Thurman. That scene ended with the pursesnatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far, far above the departing Luke and Uma.

Every time the movie approached excitement, it fizzled out, heading in the opposite direction.

From the first every other scene was a discussion about how little sex they where getting, how long its been since they got some, when their next sexual liaison will be, and with whom it should be with. On top of that the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced, not felt, and they filled their lack of content with sleazy sex scenes.

Girlfriend is an exercise in pointlessness. The onetrick pony plot is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes. The film cannot decide whether to be romantic comedy or superhero drama. The result is a film the flipflops between both, with neither aspect being very well done. Uma Thurman is tops, as usual, and Luke Wilson pulls off his role too, though his slacker antics quickly grow tired. What is even more maddening is that, in certain scenes such as when a very turned on Uma knocks a headboard through a wall, you sense a witty, raucous Reitman opus practically screaming to get out.

My Super ExGirlfriend is still an enjoyable comedy however it relies too much on cheap sex jokes and it ends up being a forgettable experience. What went wrong? The cast and the director could not overcome the weakness of the script and I did not like the way they played it out. I was expecting the guy to be a jerk and it could have been a female fantasy revenge film. However, they made the guy likable and they made the superhero a psycho. It just was not very fresh and after about forty minutes, the film wore out it is welcome. Sure, there were a few funny lines however the weak middle and horrible ending kept it from really breaking out.Director Ivan Reitman has lost his touch. After a successful run in the eighties and early nineties, he started making crap like Evolution and Fathers Day. I would not say My Super ExGirlfriend is a complete bust but I do not give him credit for any of the quality the movie holds, which is not too much. Don Payne did an awful job with the screenplay. The majority of the jokes were lame and most of the supporting characters were just onenote. He also kept reusing a lot of the same jokes making the thing really tedious at times.A few of the actors were good enough to save the film. Uma Thurman was great as GGirl and she had many funny lines. Luke Wilson was a bit pale and not very interesting. I do not think he makes for an appealing leading man and he is better in supporting roles like in The Family Stone. Anna Faris was just doing her Scary Movie routine and it is getting a little old. She needs a challenge or at least some better scripts. Wanda Sykes is either hit or miss for me. She was great in MonsterInLaw and she was bad in Clerks 2.

Outdoor sequences that ruin the feeling of being somewhere else yes, that is a Ford Focus sitting in the background. Lots and lots of teenage angst. LOTS of gyrating naked women but in the background. Which I am sure will be cut for the series and a token view of some men in towels. None of the actors except Polly Walker took my attention at all. At an hour and a half, I was still wondering when it was going to be over.So what exactly is it that is supposed to bring me back? The science fiction? It is awfully light on that. The actors? Besides Polly Walkers fine turn, there is not much interesting being done here. There are not even any hotties in the cast, except for maybe Esai, although for the younger set he is pretty old, since he is over 25.I loved BSG.

Usually I have no problem with science fiction that is mostly dialog driven as opposed to a visual bonanza of special effects. If the script is tight with some original ideas delivered by good actors one can create a profound film with little CGI money spent. This prequel has none of those aforementioned requirements going for it. The virtual reality world created by the terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous  unbelievable. This scene was simply put there to raise the release rating to Restricted. Not that teens do not love virtual reality mosh pits filled with sex  violence  heavy dance music. Its the part about those same teens having the intellectual depth  reason or political  religious passion as to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers that perplexes me. These kids are definitely not from this planet. The movie plays out like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being slightly interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz giving his cyborg a devine conscienceness via the student firmware upgrade was amusing if not entertaining. But this old concept was far better portrayed  much more believable in the brilliant, classic original Frankenstein with Boris Karloff. Caprica rips off its only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror film. No surprise there! Overall this movie was bland  unoriginal  cheap looking, using recycled CGI of Caprica from BSG.

However, Caprica does not have the action of the original series to offset the slower parts.Let me give you some helpful advice when viewing movies As a general rule, if there is a lot of excessive exploitive titillation, then you know the movie will be a dud. Caprica has lots of this. The directorwriter usually attempts to compensate for his poor abilities by throwing in a few naked bodies. It never works and all it does is demean the very young actresses involved and I feel sorry for them. Directorswriters who do this should be banned from the business.If you want to be bored for an hour and a half, by all means, rent Caprica.

Also, sorry for the caps.Starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that is all the more annoying for talking nonsense, it goes on with nonsense and unnecessary drama. That is badly but accurately put.We know space travel is a risky enterprise. There is a complicated system with a lot of potential for malfunctions, radiation, stressrelated symptoms etc, and unexpected things are bound to happen in largely unknown environments. They knew stuff could go wrong. In fact, stuff had gone wrong. It is called learning. Granted, Appollo 11 was not safe by todays standards and there was immense political pressure, but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive.Assorted mistakescomments I had not even to look up1 Nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong. Well duh. That is what I would have done. It was the apex of a propaganda war, after all.2 NASA gives green light despite the fact that Appollo 11 will probably blow up. This is only implicit, though. Yeah, that is why they let people and press watch in almostrealtime.3 The capsule ejection would not work. Like it did not work the time a chimp was in it. The one that survived? It was a test launch and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated away and landed with a parachute. There is a video of it, you can probably find it on youtube or at least look it up somewhere.4 One interviewed guy says an explosion would have wiped out a fair part of Florida. I can only assume it was meant as a hyperbole, ecause if not, I am just aghast how he could get it so wrong.5 The technology then was primitive compared to todays standards. Actually, relatively primitive software and hardware is used even today, the reason being that it must not crash. It is even worse for spacecraft, because their computers must be built of comparably large components that are not that susceptible to radiation. And the craft itself must be pilotable manually anyway, so a complex steering system like the B2s would not do. What is with the fact that they were using TV screens rather than computer screens? It is the same damn technology. Actually TV monitors were and are produced with a significantly higher definition.6 If that object was not part of the rocket, it could be only one thing. We see where this is going. Apart from the fact that the statement is wrong, who says it was not a rocket part? At least an interviewee clears up that if a thing is flying and you do not know what it is, it is by definition an Unidentified Flying Object.7 The voiceover as well as some misquotes make it seem as though the landers radiation foil was actually its hull. Which would make it thinner than a space suit.8 Neil Armstrongs near death during a practice flight is footage I can appreciate; I had not seen it before. As I said, any piece of manifest technology can go wrong, especially if it is not been tested sufficiently on account of being, you know, unprecedented.9The trajectory discrepancy of the descending lander due to irregularities in the Moons density was at no time acutely lifethreatening. Neither was the fifteen seconds of fuel left, which was, in fact, fifteen seconds of fuel left before having to abort the mission and returning to the command module.10 A catastrophic chain of events usually results in catastrophe. I really do not know how to put it any simpler. This, however, is a prime example of the rhetoric used.11 There is a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid, followed by the voiceover telling us that the reason for this strange behavior can now be revealed. Turns out, he was walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid. Hilarious stuff.12 It is mentioned that during reentry, all contact was lost. This is a perfectly natural phenomenon and it was as well known at the time as it is impossible to circumvent with contemporary technology. Again, the gravity of this is implicit, but very purposely so.13 There was never a shuttle lost in space itself, while the voiceover presents this fact as evidence that Appollo 11 was a pile of crap. Appollo 13 was a nearloss, but the two real disasters happened during liftoff and reentry, respectively. In any case, comparing shuttles to Saturn rockets is somehow ... well, okay, just plain stupid. Even ignoring that, the successful shuttle missions seem to not have been deemed of interest to the audience.14 What the hells up with the UFO? Even in the context of the movie, it makes no sense. Unless you assume it was made for entertainment purposes, aimed at a specific audience which seems to include people with next to no understanding of either history, science, or rhetorics.Even the point of the movie is somewhat obscure. Catchphrases like covered up until now, publically revealed here for the first time, come up, but the film does not place any blame or offer a lesson or anything, which could be expected of a film so emotionally done. In the good old tradition of sensationalism, there are numerous interview shots and recording fragments that are often out of context or with people that we know nothing about except NASA scientist. Wow, so the astronauts were very nervous before the endeavor? Fancy that. What does this have to do with the point of the movie again? Oh yeah, which point.In summary, in addition to being either willfully or incompetently inaccurate, it is not even good entertainment.

It makes the computer overload problem the 1202 and 1201 alarms encountered during the final landing sequence sound like a nearcatastrophe when it was just an annoyance and not a risk to the crew at all.

The plot follows a wellworn pattern with characters who have specific wellknown functions and masks that are unveiled about who they really are. Verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat. A bad editing fades a little more the film with this bad habit from Rapp to abruptly cut many sequences. Even the actors sincere input in the venture is debatable. They seem to be bored and to recite their texts than to live them, especially Sandrine Kiberlain.

Would not any female under the age of 20 do? Watching Bela go through these gyrations to get his victims, I was reminded of the idiotic Fisherman in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. In each case, there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective than employing a seemingly impossible plan that depends way to much on circumstances out of your control.

I was curious about the original title and, after some research, I found out that it refers to Shakespeares Merchant of Venice, where the usurer Shylock makes a terrible bond with the merchant Antonio, who will have to give him a pound of his flesh, in case he is not able to repay his debt. Whereas the Italian translation makes Bens plan something deeply human, characterized by human sympathy, the original one, though cultivated enough to remain unperceived by anyone, makes it, just in its reference to the flesh, something cold, rational, deeprooted in the physical side of man. Unfortunately, I think that the real quality of Bens plan is revealed by the original title ita a cold machination, aimed at donating parts of his body, but lacking any authentic human empathy, at least the audience is not given the chance to see or perceive any pure relation of souls within the whole movie. The only exception is the lovestory with the girl, which seems to be a sort of nonprogrammed incident, to which Ben yields, but incapable of conveying true emotional involvement. I really did not like the idea at the core of the movie the idea that a person, however devoured by the pain for the death of his beloved and of other people he himself has caused, takes the resolute decision to expiate his sense of guilt through suicide besides being improbable, it makes no sense. I would have liked, and I think it would have been more positive if, in the end, Ben had decided to abandon the idea of committing suicide and go on living, thus helping those same people, and maybe many more, just standing near them, and helping them through his presence. He would not have saved their lives miraculously, of course this would have probably caused more suffering, but I think it could have been more constructive from a human, and moral point of view. There are many illogical and disturbing things the initial reference to Gods creation in seven days which, by the way, according to the Bible, are six! what does it mean? And what about a woman suffering from heartdisease which prevents her from running and even from singing without feeling bad, who can have normal sex with a man who, feeling, as it should be, destroyed by the death of his wife and having donated organs and pieces of his body, does not seem to feel so much tried, both emotionally and physically, from his impaired condition?

Some people may perceive this is a heroic action and some others think he behaves cowardly, in the end this was a disturbing action to me.2. The movie story line is overdramatized, but the logic is oversimplified. Medically, blood type match is required to be an organ donor. Toward the end of the film we learnt that Emily had rear blood type that limited her chance to get the donor within short time period. Nevertheless, it seemed that Ben had the rare blood type, same as hers which allowed him to be her donor and conveniently, despite the rarity of Bens blood type, he was able to donate not only his heart, but also his kidney, his cornea and his bone marrow which in all cases require not only matching blood type but also tissue antigen.3. Why the doctors allow Bens organs being donated despite the jellyfish venom he used to kill himself?I might be overanalyzing the whole story as after all this is just a movie.

I was not curious to know why he was calling in his own suicide. There were absolutely no surprises. The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had some decent on screen chemistry. Also, I do not know her name, but the hispanic woman did an excellent job with her role as a scared and beaten wife. Woody Harrelson had very limited screen time, but I would say he stole the show whenever he was on.All in all, just an extremely run of the mill unoriginal plot.

It is overlong, it drags, the songs that are in this version and not in the film version are boring and unimaginative.

I did not know it existed and was fully prepared to see the 1963 film version when I turned it on.I played Albert a long time ago and I am thinking of putting on an amateur production of the show because I remembered it as being so much fun to do. I was not impressed with this newer version. It just was not enough fun. It was not colorful. It lacked the exuberance of youth. The lighting was bad. No one seemed to mention this fact. This is not a moody musical, it is bright and up beat. The lighting decision was a poor creative choice.Bye Bye Birdy is a farce, a comedy of errors. I got no sense of that in this version. The lighting was awful and it dulled the overall performances. The dance numbers seemed anemic as well. We do have music videos these day. At least the dance numbers should have measured up to some of the best of those, or how about some of the best of Broadway. The choreographer was asleep at the wheel it seemed.Although all the actors were supremely talented, there were some really bad casting choices. Vanessa Williams is not Latin, and with so many talented Latin performers out there, would not it have been more correct to cast one of them in the role of Rosie. Vanessa is African American, lovely and talented, but bad casting. Jason Alexanders effort was astounding, he always does intelligent work, but he just was not Albert. He was miscast and I think that is obvious to most people who see this version.The medium of film is not the medium of stage. There needs to be translation from one medium to another. The exuberance and the flash of stage musical must be TRANSLATED to film. There is no merit being faithful to a stage script when it is being filmed. The spirit, the essence of the production must be brought forth. To me the 1963 film production of Bye Bye Birdy was bright and lively, while the 1995 production was as gloomy as the lighting and as lackluster as the dance numbers.

My point is this do not discredit this review by thinking I am not a part of the choir Cusack is preaching to in War, Inc. There is no question WIs politics are tailored to appeal to my demographic, but the problem is, the tailoring is substandard and the the film Cusack co wrote, produced and stars in, fits worse than a cheap suit.As they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Cusack, his cowriters, director Joshua Seftel and even the actors involved, no doubt had every intention of making an anti war film every bit as biting and funny as Robert Altmans MASH, unfortunately for the viewer, they ended up with one as unfunny and unintelligent as Michael Moores Canadian Bacon.The current state of US politics, foreign policy and the war effort is already absurd and, as a result, tragic, pathetic and, regrettably comical  just watch The Daily Show and see for yourself. The bottom line is you cannot write material as funny as what the Bush administration provides us on a daily basis, so why try to compete?The main problem with WI is that it feels it was put together in a hurry. To get it done, Cusack basically cannibalized Grosse Pointe Blank one of his best films, changed the setting and crammed in a shopping list of ideas lifted from the collected works of Naomi Klein. Most of these ideas are rammed down your throat in the first twenty minutes of the film and what makes them so obnoxious is none of the jokes or gags or deliberately obvious references to Halliburton, the NeoCons and the US occupation of Iraq, are imaginative, clever or funny. The writers are so blinded by their \u0010own dogma they felt that by simply referencing these issues the film would be funny and subversive. The trouble is...it is not. By now these ideas are yesterdays news and unless you have been living under or rock or are so blinded by ignorance, denial and sheer stupidity read a rightwing Christian, these jokes insultingly simple.Perhaps WI would work if it was more nuanced, subversive, offensive and fattened up with detailed researchinsights into the Occupation. As it is, the jokes and sight gags are all surface and are so bad, with so little finesse, subtlety or satirical wickedness, they did little more than make me groan. Homer Simpson once said It is funny ecause it is true and The Daily Show proves this every night; War, Inc. however proves that just because it is true does not make it funny.

It seems, to me, quite rough, and almost brutal, right from the do notSingalongs to the characterization.While I remember the characters telling a story through a song, this films soundtrack was laid over the top, and did not seem to fit. Jaqs transformation into a human is a prime example Where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there, he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall! And in the ballroom, there is old barn dance type country music. It is as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set. The upbeat fiddles certainly did not fit.Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 is not up to scratch with the original. The artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed. And we see part of Cinderellas hoop skirt, which does not feel right.The movie itself could have been it is own story, I think that it should have been just that.

I am not saying the jokes are bad, but they make up most of the movie. The first time I saw the movie, I would have given it a 110.

Unfortunately, the sequel, while not the worst of the DTV sequels completely lacks the sparkle.The biggest letdown is a lack of a story. Like Belles Magical World, the characters are told through a series of vignettes. Magical World, while marginally better, still manages to make a mess of the story. In between the vignettes, we see the mice at work, and I personally think the antics of Jaq and Gus are the redeeming merits of this movie.The first vignette is the best, about Cinderella getting used to being to being a princess. This is the best, because the mice were at their funniest here. The worst of the vignettes, when Jaq turns into a human, is cute at times, but has a lack of imagination. The last vignette, when Anastasia falls in love, was also cute. The problem was, I could not imagine Anastasia being friendly with Cinderella, as I considered her the meaner out of the stepsisters. This was also marred by a rather ridiculous subplot about Lucifer falling in love with PomPom.The incidental music was very pleasant to listen to;however I hated the songs, they were really uninspired, and nothing like the beautiful Tchaikovsky inspired melodies of the original.The characters were the strongest development here. Cinderella while still caring, had lost her sincerity, and a lot of her charm from the original, though she does wear some very pretty clothes. The Duke had some truly funny moments but they were not enough to save the film, likewise with Prudence and the king. As I mentioned, the mice were the redeeming merits of the movie, as they alone contributed to the films cuteness. I have to say also the animation is colourful and above average, and the voice acting was surprisingly good.All in all, a cute, if unoriginal sequel, that was marred by the songs and a lack of a story. 410 for the mice, the voice acting, the animation and some pretty dresses.

First of all, the movie was made during the height of Disneys sequel rampage. It was created around the same time as The Little Mermaid II, The Jungle Book II, and Peter Pan II, all of which were disservices to their original film classics. Disney also made The Hunchback of Notre Dame II and Atlantis II, but I am going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place. Let me go ahead and say that I am an avid supporter of good Disney films, and I absolutely adore the original Disney Cinderella. The sequel to Cinderella, however, was a waste of time. The character of Cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that I grew up watching. In the original, Cinderella was kind and loving. The new Cinderella had very outofcharacter moments with currentera phrasing like, I am going to do this banquet my way! Let me also tell you that new Cinderella as I have affectionately named her says, Ewww! That is the antiCinderella. I try to find the best in people, but in the sequel, Anastasia, one of the stepsisters, is good! What the heck? Why? They made it all out to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just horrible family members for poor little Anastasia. My question to the world did the people at Disney watch the original Cinderella when making this sequel? Well, it surely does not seem so. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was just as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I am all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no point of redemption for Anastasia in this movie. In the first one, Anastasia was evil. In the second one, she is good.

How could anyone let such laboured delivery pass without reshooting the scenes? Again and again, Much sounds as if he is struggling with halfcomprehended Shakespeare rather than letting loose with a salty quip; I hoped at the onset that it was just a failed comedy trait in a character clearly destined for the role of comedy sidekick, but then it started spreading throughout the rest of the cast.Whatever else you say about Errol Flynn in the role, he had the knack of delivering highflown dialogue as naturally as if he would just thought it up on the spur of the moment... and as this production shows, that is not at all as easy as it sounds! If they were going to cast the characters as cheeky chappies, the actors in question should have been given appropriate lines they sound as if they have not a clue how to handle them.I am afraid I did not even like the pantomime Sheriff, for a similar reason; the lines are clearly not intended to be taken seriously but delivered and in this case written with a nudge and a wink at the audience. They are out of place all right  fourthwallbusting stuff  but really not that funny.This muchpromised production reminded me of a limping school play.

The British director J. Lee Thompson made some excellent films, notably Ice Cold in Alex and Cape Fear, but Country Dance is one of his more curious offerings. The story is set among the upper classes of rural Scotland, and details the strange triangular relationship between Sir Charles Ferguson, an eccentric aristocratic landowner, his sister Hilary, and Hilarys estranged husband Douglas, who is hoping for a reconciliation with her. We learn that during his career as an Army officer, Charles was regarded as having low moral fibre. This appears to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition; throughout the film he displays an attitude of gloomy disillusionment with the world, and his main sources of emotional support seem to be Hilary and his whisky bottle. The film ends with his committal to an upperclass lunatic asylum. Peter OToole was, when he was at his best as in Lawrence of Arabia, one of Britains leading actors, but the quality of his work was very uneven, and Country Dance is not one of his better films. He overacts frantically, making Charles into a caricature of the useless inbred aristocrat, as though he were auditioning for a part in the Monty Python UpperClass Twit of the Year sketch. Susannah York as Hilary and Michael Craig as Douglas are rather better, but there is no really outstanding acting performance in the film. There is also little in the way of coherent plot, beyond the tale of Charless inexorable downward slide.The main problem with the film, however, is neither the acting nor the plot, but rather that of the Theme That Dare Not Speak Its Name. There are halfhearted hints of an incestuous relationship between Charles and Hilary, or at least of an incestuous attraction towards her on his part, and that his dislike of Douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy. Unfortunately, even in the swinging sixties and early seventies the date of the film is variously given as either 1969 or 1970 there was a limit to what the British Board of Film Censors was willing to allow, and a film with an explicitly incestuous theme was definitely offlimits. The American title for the film was Brotherly Love, but this was not used in Britain; was it too suggestive for the liking of the BBFC? These hints are therefore never developed and we never get to see what motivates Charles or what has caused his moral collapse, resulting in a hollow film with a hole at its centre. 410","label":0},{"index":3796,"txt":"To Die For 1989 was just another d.t.v. feature that made an appearance on cable ad nasuem during the early nineties.

It is not the most cinematic of games, and the long, talky middle part in which their marriage falls apart just about kills the film.There is one interesting bit though. As Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk start their climactic game, a series of quick shots show airplanes, trains, football games, even a diver in midair, freezing in anticipation of the event.

After the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of Romanian were kind of complicate.On my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere, I do not feel any particular impression and effect from the movie. The love proceeding of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and her brother Sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story.The two main reasons I do not like this movie are, firstly, the film did not told us how they started to fall in love? Sounds like after Alex moved into the building which Kiki was living, then two girls are fall in love. It does not make sense at all. How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too much fragments, you need to image and connect those stories by your mind. Secondly, The whole film did not have a scene of Alex and Kiks sexual intercourse, that s what I was waiting for\u0085\u0085. However, it still had some parts were deserved to recommend. The ear piercing  part was kind of interesting. Alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kiks love. That was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love.

While a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony, it certainly cannot promote winning bridge, so the satire did not work for me. But there were some items I found enjoyable anyway, especially with the big bridge match between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film. It is treated like very much like a championship boxing match. Not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring, there is a referee hovering between the contestants, and radio broadcaster Roscoe Karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings. At one point he even enumerates One... Two... Three... Four... as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event. And people were glued to their radios for it all, a common event for championship boxing matches. That spoof worked very well indeed.Unfortunately, few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire. Paul Lukas does not have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast; lovely Loretta Young and the usual comic Frank McHugh were not given good enough lines; Glenda Farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film, but she practically disappears thereafter.

Let the wacky hijinks and low budget buffoonery ensueat least, such were my hopes for this film.Now I like the occasional terrible movie, and if you are reading the comments on Exterminators of the Year 3000, you probably do too. That being said, I rated this film a solid 1awfulnot because I completely hated the film but because it is one of the most legitimately dreadful efforts at moviemaking I have ever seen. The dialogue, the acting, the cinematography, the soundediting, the editing in general, the plot, etc., etc., etcall are worthy of what must surely be low spectator expectations given that marvelous title.So what is really good about this bad movie? It does have several of what my circle affectionately terms quality kills. A quality kill, for those few of you unfamiliar with the phrase, is not a hard and fast term, but in general refers to someone killed in a particularly gruesome, creative, or ridiculous fashion.Exterminators of the Year 3000 also has a fair supply of dialoguesobaditbecomesfunny, provided in great part by Crazy Bull, the aptly titled leader of the hapless motorpsycho gangwho incidentally also provide most of the quality kills if you are hoping for big things from the nuke mutants, think again, they play essentially zero part in the movie...shucks!. Crazy Bull, however, is all you could ask for in a bmovie motorpsycho. Shakespearean paraphrase and oddly PGstyle insults are all he knows how to say...and that is terrific.Despite its quality kills and bad dialogue, however, if you are looking for a truly entertaining bad movie, Exterminators of the Year 3000 does disappoint somewhat in that with its draw limited to things like silly and outdated special effects, quality killing, and bad dialogue, there is simply not enough to justify a full feature length, owing principally to the forty minutes or so in which the audience is forced to follow the characters in protracted and boring car chases and long desert hiking sequences...All in all, a pretty good awful movie, but hey, it is no Death Race 2000.","label":0},{"index":3804,"txt":"It is hard to believe people actually LIKE this dreck!

Three years after this, she would star in Airplane! as the woman who hangs herself while listening to Robert Hays pine for Julie Hagerty. I could not get that image out of my head.Matt Boston is a fifteen year old with problems. He has headaches. His mother had a nervous breakdown. His grandfather had a massive heart attack. A chain smoking psychiatrist decides to find out what the devil is going on with this family. First she hypnotizes Grandma Nelson. Nelson tells a tale in flashback that fills the entire first half of the film.She and Grandpa bought an RV, cheap, and drive it around to all the tourist traps in desert California. The RV soon has a mind of its own, going off the road and such. Then, large boulders begin hurling themselves at it. The elderly couple are appropriately afraid, but stay in the vehicle in order to move the plot along.Eventually, Grandpa has a heart attack after being stranded on the RV roof when it goes for another unplanned ride.Bostons mom begins talking to some Native American mummies she has lying around the house. She fancies herself an author, and makes copious notes about the musty corpses. The psychiatrist reads the detailed notes, and uses her imagination to fill in the blanks. We see the mother semiflip out, but her mental breakdown occurs offscreen, much like Gramps heart attack.Finally, the patient de resistance, little Matt. Matt goes under the hypnosis gun and tells his own tale. He thinks mom is wigging out this was made in 1977. Apparently, mom is making the astral bodies of the Native American mummies sort of fly through the air. One hits Matt like a bee hits a windshield, and Matt begins acting all crazy.The psychiatrist takes Grandma and Matt into the desert. Matt is inexplicably in a wheelchair now, and the trio confront the unseen and unexplained forces.Flocker has no sense of scene construction. The one pro here involves the RV stranded in a salt flat in the desert. In the distance, the couple notice some boulders rolling toward the RV. This is a pretty creepy little scene that is eventually overplayed. As the boulders begin hurling themselves toward the vehicle, the special effects become obvious.The scenes where the RV runs off the highway, then back on again, take forever. The scenes where Grandpa is trapped on the RV roof as it careens down a dirt road takes forever. Moms conversations with the mummy take forever. Matts out of body experiences take forever. This film takes forever.I was tempted to hit the fast forward button at least a dozen times. As scenes dragged on, it was obvious Flocker was padding. Cut the fat here, and this would have clocked in at an hour. The final explanation, that the mummies spirits were trying to kill those close to Matt never holds water. Did they inhabit the RV? The film maker never brings up the fact that the spirits are no good at their murderous ways, they never kill anybody!As I kept thinking of Nelson in Airplane!, I also thought of other movies. Anything to keep me from falling asleep during this one. Boston is terrible as the kid, playing a fifteen year old as a cute ten year old who has a smart alecky line for all these adults who fall over themselves loving him.In the end, Flocker has written and directed a mess. The title is just the beginning of this exercise in making the audience feel ill at ease.

I will bet Virgnina Leath, who played the head in a pan had to spend a lot of uncomfortable time wearing that pan around her neck and squatting under a table.

It is very difficult to imagine how a script this repulsively sexist could have been written without the intention of selfparody. And the themes that are expressed repeatedly by the female lead, Ginny Leith  a detached head kept alive by machines, IVs and clamps  seem to confirm that the film was meant to simultaneously exploit and critique gender stereotypes. Shades of the underrated Boxing Helena.The genderisms are plentiful, and about as irritating as an army of angry ants. The dialog is hyperbolic, overdramatic and unbelievable, and the acting is merely OK but not consistent. Why have I given this film a 4? Because some thought clearly went into it. I am really not sure what point the film was really trying to make, but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually edgy and raw sort of horror without the blood and guts todays audiences expect.Another unique and interesting aspect of the Brain is that there really are not any heroes in this film, and none of the characters are particularly likable.All considered, this is a fairly painful and disturbing look at early 1960s American pop sexuality, from the viewpoint of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what should have been a fatal car crash. Her lover is threatening to sew a fresh, high quality, body onto her and force her to continue living with him. She is understandably nonplussed by all of this and forced to befriend a creature who is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend. Oh, there are also some vague references to the 1950s60s clich\u00e9 about the evils of science run amok.Recommended for B sci fi buffs and graduate students in gender studies.

That is to say, for a guy in a big rubber suit in an actionscifihorror flick that could benefit from some mystery, the shark gets a lot of screen time. Granted, it is usually shaky and erratic.

The camera goes back to the person about to get eaten, only now they are screaming and armless. And so on.The costuming is bad, the acting is poor, and the special effects are subpar, but the writing is by far the worst. Things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten, or so something can explode. Because LET ME TELL YOU, the people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions  more better mindset. Characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion. They shoot helicopters, there is a massive explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, WHATEVER, they all explode, so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end.Speaking of which, I do not care how crazy a person is, I find it hard to believe that anyone would think trying to make a giant halfperson halfshark have sex with a woman in order to make freaky shark people babies is a good idea. That is, UNLESS that person is the mad scientist in this movie.The bad thing is, the movie is so random and at times, boring that even its badness is not really enough to hold a persons prolonged interest.

This island affords him the opportunity to recruit fresh victims for his work and son. They think it is a professional affair in regards to a breakthrough in stem cell research which could lead to cures for a variety of diseases. Combs son was dying of kidney cancer when he decided to perform his mad science on him, creating this bloodthirsty, flesheating creature which can both swim and walk on dry land..although, at first the hammerhead could only remain outside for short time periods. Tylo was dating Combs son, hence the connection besides the two having worked for Roberts, who brings along his trophy wife, Mariya Ignatova. Also accompanying Tylo and Forsythe, Roberts and Ignatova, are their colleagues, Elise Muller and GR Johnson. Combs traps them in a conference room, but they are able to escape onto the island as he sends after them his well paid mercenaries and hammerhead shark son.Like similar scifi channel creature features of it is type, HammerheadShark Frenzy has some rather unappealing computer generated effects and the attacks..where the shark rips apart limbsare shot in a quickedit, frenzied camera format where you have a hard time ever seeing any of the ensuing gory carnage. You have this vague notion that a person is being eaten..ripped to shreds, but the attacks themselves are shot in a very erratic fashion which, truth be told, is rather infuriating. The monster itself is never seen in it is entirety, just momentary glimpses of an eye or a body part being gnawed on as the victim screams out in horror. One things for certain, you do see teeth. We do get cgi shots of the hammerhead shark swimming toward the screen, all menacing, ready to feast on flesh. A constant is while..and aftervictims are attacked, we see a great deal of blood and bits of flesh bubbling to the waters surface..this is really director Michael Oblowitzs main cue as to inform the viewer that those being torn apart are goners.Combs does not break new ground as the scientist, but he is always had an ability to convey a quiet madness under this coldblooded resolve. It is fun seeing Forsythe in a rare cleancut hero role, very against type as an electronics wiz..to his credit, he actually pulls it offwho must assume a leadership position when the group faces unprecedented peril. Tylo is also in a very different kind of role, a scientist who can defend herself quite well. Roberts can play the millionaire businessman roles in his sleep, and it is kind of neat seeing him firing off a machine gun at Combs soldiers..although, his fate is not pleasant. Mentioning that, it was also really entertaining watching Forythe and Tylo downing Combs hired goons with confiscated automatic machine guns. As expected, the screenplay allows those who created the murderous fiend to put themselves in unnecessary danger just so that they can pay for their sins..I mean, seriously, would these people knowingly leave themselves so vulnerable to attack after seeing just what damage to the human anatomy it could do?

It always winds up feeling so damned convenient and I immediately deduct points from any movie that uses this hackneyed device. Hammerhead is the story of a mad scientist who is conducting experiments on one of these uncharted islands, so the movie already had a lot to make up for before it even began.The island in this movie used to belong to Dr. Moreau, but has recently been purchased by the ReAnimator himself, Jeffrey Combs. Old Jeffrey is doing some kind of cutting edge stem cell research, which has led him to start working with sharks while searching for a cure for cancer. If that sounds familiar, that is because this is roughly the same basic setup as the smart shark facility in Deep Blue Sea, not to mention a host of other Nu Image movies. So apparently, Jeffreys son was dying of cancer which prompted our mad doctor to start experimenting on his progeny. He did some kind of super fancy gene splicing and so forth, turning his son into a sharkman.William Forsythe leads a crew of unknown actors to the island to look into the doctors experiments. If someone would have given him a sailors hat, William would have been a dead ringer for the Skipper from Gilligans Island. In typical Bond Villain fashion, the doctor decides that all of these intruders would make nice chum for his son. Not chums, like buddies... chum, like shark food. So enter sharkboy who starts stalking the Skipper and his cohorts all over the island. They, of course, make halfhearted attempts to escape and are thwarted over and over again while being chased by a guy in a rubber sharkman suit. The movie did not make up any of the points that it lost for taking place on one of those dastardly deserted islands. It is funny that this movie is called Hammerhead, it made me think of an old joke. Why do you hit yourself in the head with a hammer? Because it feels so good when you stop.

Spare me the cheap attempt at SciFi and do me the service of actually making an attempt at the willing suspension of disbelief.However, having seriously defamed the overall concept of this film, let me tell you again that, as sad as it may sound, this is probably worth your time. If nothing else, it is a tour de force of bad SciFi  worth the education for the new movie buff and certainly worthy of a refresher course for those who have seen a few movies in their day.The crazy hunchback mad scientist with a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it is a good idea to spoon canfuls of blood into the nearby water makes me question not only the intelligence of mankind, but also the ability of B movie writers to come up with remotely plausible plot lines.This film also pretty much fulfills one of my longtime bad movie contentions  bad guys always wear sunglasses.If this were not 2005, I would be deadset on the fact this film was some sort of insanely poor metaphor for the Cold War. I mean, you might as well have Khan on the bridge of a Klingon Bird of Prey inserting leaches into Chekhovs ear.One of the most moving lines of the movie is when the chick without the bra insists that the Charlton Heston lookalike, wait for Tom as he is trying to lift the escape helicopter off the ground. The thing is, Tom is wasting the bad sunglass guys with his neverending banana clip attached to his Kalashnikov, or AK47, in laymans terms.As the mad scientist says near the end of the film, my goal is to evolve the human species  suffice it to say that this movie contributed only to a devolution of humankind. The faint Freudian references uttered by the mad scientist as he prepping the female protagonist to be mated with a hammerhead shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction we can all find something to laugh about.","label":0},{"index":3853,"txt":"I do admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view, nearly 30 years after the making of this movie and at the time of its conception, it may have been a brilliant horrorthriller movie.Beginning on Halloween night 1968, 6 year old Michael commits the brutal murder of his 18 year old sister. Michael is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later escapes and returns to his home town to murder again.From this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable. The beginning of every scene is easily predictable in the way it will end whilst the music for each scene containing Michael the murderer is exactly the same throughout the movie, thus alerting the viewer to the likely events to follow.For the horrorthriller enthusiast, there is a severe lack of bloodgore compared to modern day films although I am not akin to the amount that is displayed in this day and age. A happier medium could have been found.From a half hour into the movie, not one scene is unexpected. The acting for a horrorthriller film is fairly typical of the era and thus lacks any punch for the modern day enthusiast.A positive for the film is its lingering camera shots and dark lighting which creates a frightening atmosphere. A second positive would be the character of Michaels doctor, who provides clues to the probability of where the story may lead.However, it is clear that the star, in JamieLee Curtis, is in the infancy stages of her acting career and thus fails to provide a truly frightened central victim.It is hard for me to rate this film as it was in its day, but from other horrorthriller films of indeed the 80s and to a lesser extent, the 90s, it falls far short of a truly great horrorthriller film.I suggest you move on and find a classic from the 80s.

And generally, I hate remakes.Surely he will more than compensate for all the random timefilling gaps with some quirky points of interest that the original severely lacks.This is a movie we feel we have to like, much like the way we are taught that we SHOULD enjoy Dickens.Do not assume this is a classic.","label":0},{"index":3855,"txt":"I was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise, the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man.Intriguing.NOT!

I felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension, the lesbian subplot went nowhere and those smokingdrinking women all 3 in their forties??? were very unrealistic  even in the baby scene  screw the baby, gimme a cigarette!

The most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter. The film goes downhill from there and does not pick up until the last fifteen minutes, but by then it is too late, we the audience have lost all interest in the story. There is barely any character development, and people always rave about Laurie being such an exceptional heroine, when there really is not much to her. I am sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie, but if you want a great horror movie go watch The Shining or Rosemarys Baby. Those are the two best horror films ever made.

There is no character development, no back story, no character arcs, nothing. The good guys do things because they are good, while the bad guys do things solely because they are bad.

The story is puerile, the animation is TV quality  I insist that it is considerably worse than his 70s stuff  and whereas Wizards had real imagination, quirkiness, some gorgeous background art, and an underground, adult sensibility, Fire and Ice is just designed for 14 year old boys, and has the intellectual clout of Robinson Crusoe on Mars.Yes, if you liked the Gor books, you might like this.

I know immediately they have a case of barelyhidden amusement  horror. You see, I was the cinematographer on the film.Let me clarify some points regarding this interesting life experience.Originally, SNITCHD was called ONE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July of 1999, a day after I wrapped TRIANGLE SQUARE, a great little 35mm feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival accolades...it fell eternal victim to the fine print of SAGs notorious Experimental Feature contract. But I digress...I though I was on a roll, and when James asked me to shoot his little gangster flick in 16mm with a shooting budget of about 25,000, not wanting to break pace, I took it. After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI... I too believed the myth back then.Let us just chalk it up as film school for many involved, myself included. SNITCHD was shot over two weeks in August, 1999, in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA. Cahill taught Drama at a High School in the latter city  yes, he is a Drama and English teacher...consider THAT while watching the film, or even observing the use of apostrophe in title , hence the locations and cast.Of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of L.A.s Channel 2 Morning News weather girl Vera Jimenez, and of greater impact, the debut of Eva Longoria, who had just arrived in Hollywood and was as eager as I to get a film under her belt. I must say her professional dedication, focus and let us do this attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardomyettocome. SNITCHD suffered from poor optics, few lights or electricity, several boom operators du jour, and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication. None of that overshadows the actual content, which speaks for itself.Anyway, by 2003, the film was sold to distributors  at a net loss, I understand  who inexplicably had no photos of Eva on the box  by then she was a rising, working name  but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic Latino gangster to lend credibility to SNITCHD. Since Cahills other passion is antiquarian book dealing, it appears to confirm he believes you can, in fact, judge a book by it is cover... as so many have picked up this DVD based on it is sleeve.  One year later, Eva, now on a soap, and I met James for one day to shoot a simple short film he had concocted, SPLIT SECOND, which I think has never seen any play despite festival intent. 6 years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill film titled JUAREZ, Mexico. I though he had worked out the process; my participation was contingent on casting, script and crew control, and the resultant film actually looked promising in dailies, for what it was... a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in Juarez; despite claims here and elsewhere, the film has NEVER appeared in any festival or venue, although Cahill has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the DVD release of two studio pictures on the same subject, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and BORDER TOWN.","label":0},{"index":3864,"txt":"This movie is weak ,The boxcover says East LAs toughest gang and it is really Santa Anas , James Cahill acts like a closet queen taking down all the tough guys in the tough Chlo gang .

There is a Swedish girl, a Danish, a German and a Chinese. The story contrives to get the clothes off all of them, involve them in some Carry Ontype humour and couple them with various misfits from the British film and TV culture of the time, including Man About the House star Richard OSullivan, future Coronation Street rogue Johnny Briggs and horror film stalwart Ferdy Mayne playing a sheik. There is a pretty risqu\u00e9 amount of female nudity on display, for those who like that kind of thing but obviously nothing hardcore.Most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential; the girls are stereotypes, and German Anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder  she is a moron obsessed with colour TV who acts like a kind of uninhibited child  dresses to deliberately show her private parts; in another more serious film, she would be a psychiatric case. The most interesting section of the film involves the Swedish girl being taken to a club in London where some dodgy types are still trying to swing, being seduced by a middleaged rocker, losing her virginity and realising that the scene is not for her. These sequences have some energy in them and point to a more intriguing film than we have ended up with, in which promiscuity and the dregs of the music business and upper classes live soulless and seedy lives there is a fine turn by John Standing as an impotent public school rou\u00e9. The strangest of the stories has the Chinese girl future cannibal film veteran Me Me Lay getting off with her childish piano prodigy employer, falling mutually in love with and then leaving in the middle of the night for no good reason at all, except some orientalist notion that Chinese birds are inscrutable, as not they?! The film is pretty demeaning to its women characters and there is a smattering of homophobia in the dialogue and one of the characterisations. The end is striking, as Maynes sheik for no earthly reason except they have to end the film somehow whisks all of the girls away to his Arab kingdom for what looks to all the world like a future in the white slave trade, which they are all delighted about.Stuff and nonsense for the most part then, but directed with a fair amount of skill by veteran Val Guest, which puts it as a piece of filmmaking a notch above most of the 70s Brit sexploitation flicks.","label":0},{"index":3879,"txt":"I remember rather enjoying this a few years back but coming to it again, I wonder why.

What is more this begins predictably enough as a sex farce similar in vein to the Confessions films but about a third of the way through whilst we are beginning to enjoy the presence of the lovely Me Me Lai the film asks us to start taking it seriously. Not only that but the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forced and just look stilted. In short this is neither as innocently silly or as intelligently serious as it seems to intend. Richard OSullivan maybe, as such a central figure, could have helped but I reckon this to be one of his worst performances. Just worth it for the ladies.","label":0},{"index":3880,"txt":"I caught this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival. I had not heard much about it; only that it was a tightlypaced thriller, shot digitally on a very low budget. I was hoping to catch the next big BritFlick.

This Is Not A Love Song follows two criminals, who, after accidentally shooting and killing a farmers young daughter, become embroiled in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt them down.The real problem is that this is yet another example of style over substance in a British film. The camera angles and editing are completely at odds with the story, as are the over the top performances, and the appalling use of slow motion, which only serves to make the whole thing look like an expensive home video. There are repeated attempts to make the film look edgy and gritty, which instead come over as hilarious and over the topCue a pathetic, obligatory drug scene, and countless, pointless camera zooms. No amount of cliche is such as this can disguise the fact that this is a pretty bad story.We have seen this kind of thing many times before, and made a hundred times better, particularly in John Boormans masterful Deliverance. But while in the latter film, we actually cared about the characters, in this film, I found myself just wanting them to be hunted down and killed as quickly as possible. Even this would not have been so bad if their adversaries had been frightening or worthwhile, but instead, are merely a collection of stereotypical, inbredlooking countryfolk. Again, another offensive, overused cliche coming to the fore. Surely there are some nice people in the country, filmmakers?In its defense, This Is Not A Love Song does contain a couple of good, suspenseful moments, but it is hard to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video, or, at a push, getting a very limited cinema release.

John Norman Howard is a worn out, disillusioned rock star on the decline, embarking upon a romance with a fresh, talented new singing sensation, Esther Hoffman.

The only redeeming parts of the film are a few numbers by Streisand, because the Kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to. The main problem of this film is that we never see Kristoffersons character at his peak or Streisands character struggling. The first should be seen in decline and the second rising. The final Streisand number _could have been_ one of the greatest finales in film, if it was directed and edited properly. The single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake. Had the band, audience and wide shots of the stage been shown, this number could have been dynamic and interesting. This film must have been directed and edited by an NYU film school dropout.

As I watched it for the first time I was expecting another romantic, tearjerking Barbra Streisand film; Something like The Way We Were. I was certainly wrong. The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and her John Howard, was nonexistent, making it impossible to get attached to the characters. There was not anything romantic about it. Streisands character fell for an alcoholic drug addict who could not sing a single note without making me want to hit the fastforward button. At one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later. There is nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who cannot seem to realize it until he actually dies. Parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on, and I kept asking myself when it was going to end.The death of John Howard was completely predictable. There was totally obvious foreshadowing of his reckless behavior early on in the movie, and when he died I felt no emotion whatsoever. It was not a tragic accident, it was him basically being an idiot. Not to mention throughout the movie I was distracted by his hideous beard.The only parts of this movie worth seeing are the Streisand songs. The ending of the movie when she sings With One More Look At YouWatch Closely Now was my reason for giving this film a whopping 310. Those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie I actually felt an emotion other than irritation and anger.","label":0},{"index":3892,"txt":"To grasp where this 1976 version of A STAR IS BORN is coming from consider this Its final number is sung by Barbra Streisand in a seven minute and forty second closeup, followed by another twoandhalfminute freeze frame of Ms. Streisand  striking a Christlike pose  behind the closing credits. Over ten uninterrupted minutes of Barbras distinctive visage dead center, filling the big screen with uncompromising ego. That just might be some sort of cinematic record.Or think about this The plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars, yet, while Streisands songs are performed in their entirety  including the interminable finale  her costar Kris Kristofferson is not allowed to complete even one single song he performs. Nor, though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her ditties, do they actually sing a duet.Or consider this Streisands name appears in the credits at least six times, including taking credit for musical concepts and her wardrobe from her closet  and she also allegedly wanted, but failed to get codirecting credit as well. One of her credits was as executive producer, with a producer credit going to her thenboyfriend and former hairdresser, Jon Peters. As such, Streisand controlled the final cut of the film, which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction. What it does not explain is how come, given every opportunity to make The Great Diva look good, their efforts only make Streisand look bad. Even though this was one of Streisands greatest box office hits, it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performance.Anyway, moving the melodrama from Hollywood to the world of sexdrugsandrocknroll, Streisand plays Esther Hoffman, a pop singer on the road to stardom, who shares the fast lane for a while with Kristoffersons John Norman Howard, a hard rocker heading for the off ramp to Hasbeenville. In the previous incarnations of the story, Norman Maine sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer Vicky Lester achieve her success. In the feminist seventies, Streisand  Co. want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man, so the trajectory is skewed; she will succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one; he is a burden she must endure in the name of love. As such, there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just tougher, but almost ruthless, while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twit.Kristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material; making little attempt to give much of a performance, and oddly it serves his aimless, listless character well. Streisand, on the other hand, exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen. Everything she does seems, if not too rehearsed, at least too controlled. Even her apparent ad libs seem awkwardly premeditated and her moments of supposed hysteria coldly mechanical. The two have no chemistry, making the central love affair totally unbelievable. You might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence, though at age 34, Streisand does not seem particularly young or naive. The only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom. And, indeed, had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way, to make Streisands character openly play an exploitive villain, the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to exist.But I guess the filmmakers actually see Esther as a sympathetic victim; they do not seem to be aware just how coldblooded and self absorbed she is. But sensitivity is not one of the films strong points note the petty joke of giving Barbra two African American back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism of calling the trio The Oreos. And the film makes a big deal of pointing out that Esther retains her ethnic identity by using her given name of Hoffman, yet the filmmakers have changed the characters name of the previous films from Esther Blodgett so that Streisand will not be burdened with a name that is too Jewish or too unattractive. So much for ethnic pride.The backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the films release is near legendary, so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable. Nominal director Frank Pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie, with considerable help from ace cinematographer Robert Surtees. And the film did serve its purpose, producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes including the Oscarwinning Evergreen by Paul Williams and Streisand. But overall the film turned out to be the one thing Streisand reportedly claimed she did not want it to be, a vanity project.","label":0},{"index":3893,"txt":"OK, people, honestly... this gotta be one of the worst movies about show biz that is ever been made, but I have been laughing myself silly which may be why I enjoyed it.

I was told that this movie really had little to do with Springer himself, rather it centered on the lives of those who would appear on Springer. Handled better, this movie might have actually been a fascinating look at how pathetic these peoples lives actually are. I will admit, I felt a twinge of empathy for Connie Molly Hagan. This is all she has in life. How sad that she feels she must go on Jerrys show in order to resolve this.I really feel sorry for Molly Hagan appearing in this. Have you noticed that after this movie, she has mainly been relegated to B roles on TV? I will say this about Hagan. She is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no doubt that she is very earnest in her acting and she tries to play her roles with a lot of empathy. The problem is that Hagan cannot carry a scene on her own.

While his show is undeniably offensive and stupid, it also gives us a chance to see that, relatively speaking, most of us have it real good. When you look at the trailer park livin, dollar whiskey drinkin, incest lovin people on the Springer show, it makes even your worst day seem like a walk in the park. Jerry is performing a public service, and we should be grateful. He ditched a political career to host the show, just for us.What we should not be grateful for in any way is the piece of garbage movie Ringmaster. Ringmaster shows what life is like for people who wind up being guests on the show, or so they would like us to think. The movie follows the prerequisite Springer story line Love triangles. One triangle involves Connie, her daughter Angel, and her husband Rusty. The other involves Starletta, Vonda, and Demond. When the two hapless groups meet up in LA, their lives intertwine and collide headon, all culminating in an explosive episode of the Springer show. It is like what Short Cuts would be if Robert Altman had had a severe crack habit.Ringmaster is true to the show, as it is stupid and offensive from start to finish. It also makes me very glad that I do not live in the squalor it is characters do. But the movie has a problem. It is billed as a comedy, but it just is not very funny. What laughs there are to be had are few and far between. Maybe some people watch this and laugh nonstop. If you think blow jobs and rape are funny, well then I guess you are one of those folks. Personally, I laughed two or three times and spent the rest of the movie in utter awe of the agonizing horrors of whitetrash life.The Jerry Springer Show just is not meant to make the leap from TV to the silver screen. What is funny in an hour long show less, when you count commercials is not necessarily going to be funny in a ninety minute movie. Movies have to tell a story, and that is something else Ringmaster has trouble with. The story is threadbare. There are so many plot holes and continuity errors that any attempt at telling a cohesive narrative is quickly put asunder. And even if there were not such problems, how much fun can you pull out of a story of stereotypical people in a stereotypical story? Even the Hollywood formula could not make this better. Ringmaster is so bad, it even screws up the best part of the Springer show the Final Thought. Somehow, even the smartest and simplest aspect of the show wound up blowing harder than the slutty women the film is built around.The worst offender in all of this is Springer himself. He is such a bad actor that he cannot even play himself convincingly. Watching Springer play Springer is sad. It is like he was going for a What if Woody Allen played Jerry Springer vibe, and he failed. Miserably. He went to the trouble of producing this disaster, the least he could do is try to make it just that much better.Not that I am saying everyone else in this movie put in an award worthy performance. Just the opposite. They all suck. Not so surprisingly, no one in this movie went on to greatness. The best any of them was did was Molly Hagan landing a job on a Nickelodeon sitcom. Apparently, Nickelodeon has no problem with hiring a woman who starred in the most vile film of the 90s to star in a childrens program. It makes you wonder what kind of things the other adults on that channel have done in their pasts.Here are my Final Thoughts What we have here is a group of people with no self respect and a man with money to burn, who have met and put their resources together to produce a film that shows how much they hate themselves and how little they think of the intelligence of their viewing audience. Should we accept people who make movies that treat us like severely braindamaged lumps of goo? I say no. Somewhere out there, in this crazy, mixed up world, there is a perfect movie for each of us.

The film would be better off if it were, because at least the worst film I have ever seen, Prom Night II interested me enough for me to hate it. My only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when I looked up at the clock and discovered that only 90 minutes had passed. It had seemed much more like years. It is an endless repetition of poor people, or what Jerry Springer seems to believe poor people are, screwing each other, hitting each other, insulting each other, and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing. The plot, which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the Jerry Springer mill, advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters. This makes it impossible to care what happens to them. It never mattered to me whether they got on the show, or what they said, or who slept with whom. Maybe I am not supposed to care about them. Maybe I am supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny. Too bad it is not. The humor is not outrageous. It is innocuous. It is predictable. Humor has to have something behind it, some kind of painful irony or life experience, in order to function. Scatology is not wit. An example. A mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed. To take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughters boyfriend. Since I was over the shock of Jerry Springers show a long time ago, I had the same reaction I had to Andrew Dice Clays obscene nursery rhymes; not laughter, just yawning. Lastly, I found Springers pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing. If he really were an advocate of the poor, he would bring on a single mom from BedSty to talk about trying to raise her kids in New York City on 12,000 a year. Or, failing that, he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits. Jerry Springer gets millions for his shows, his movie, his book and videos. His guests just get round trip air fare, hotel accommodations, and a chance to humiliate themselves. If he liked poor people so much, he would give them at least some of the money they earn for him. It appears that Springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself. Jeez, with all his fine work, you would think he would have earned our respect already.

It is so badly edited, with scenes that just do not connect, and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and it is simply all over the map! Just imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce. With seldom laughs. My only positive note is a hot girlgirl scene. That is as risque as it gets.

There is a very similar feel to James Whales Frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of Lionel Atwills Dr Niemann character, complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancement.The vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a redherring by having suspicion fall on batloving village simpleton Herman Dwight Frye, thus providing the excuse for a torchwielding mob to go on the rampage  as if they needed one.This is one of a trio of early horror films in which Lional Atwill and Fay Wray costarred also Doctor X and The Mystery of the Wax Museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from illadvised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements. Taken in context though, The Vampire Bat is still weak and derivative.All we are left with is a poorquality Frankenstein imitation, with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink Dracula fans.

The script by Edward T. Lowe Jr. takes itself rather seriously  sets up the basic story that something is killing local villagers  that something could possibly be a Vampire, then for most of it is duration the film focuses on Brettschneider  his incompetent investigations which are, not to put too fine a point on it, boring. The Vampire Bat also has a bit of an identity crisis as it does not quite know what it wants to be, the title would suggest a horror film while the majority of it could easily be described as a thriller with the final few minutes descending into silly scifi. There is no Vampire Bat, the attempts to fool you are pathetic, all the characters are broad stereotypes  you can tell the villain of the piece straight away  as a whole there is nothing particularly exciting or entertaining about The Vampire Bat. I know it is old but that is not an excuse as cinema has moved on a lot since 1933  a bland, flat, dull, boring  misleading film such as The Vampire Bat just does not cut it these days, just look at the original King Kong 1933 released the same year  how brilliantly that still holds up today. I did not like it  I doubt many modern filmgoers would either, it is as simple  straight forward as that.Director Strayer does not do anything special but this is a case in point where I can cut the film some slack because of it is age, as a whole it is pretty much point, shoot  hope for the best stuff. There is not much in the way of atmosphere or scares although some of the sets which were already existing ones taken from The Old Dark House 1932  Universals European set on their backlot are nice  add a certain ambiance to things.Technically The Vampire Bat cannot compare to anything even remotely modern, for the age of it it is alright I suppose but again I draw your attention back to the original King Kong. Speaking of King Kong it is star Fay Wray has a role in this as does horror icon Lionel Atwill, I will be kind  say the acting is OK.The Vampire Bat will I imagine fool a lot of people into thinking that it is a horror film about Vampire Bats when in fact it is not, personally I thought the whole thing was a bit of a bore.

That is the disappointment.We get little more than the formulaic elements of such films but with slow pacing, low budget, not enough of Dwight Frye, the overdone presence of Maude Eburne Aunt Gussie, and the premise for Lionel Atwill Dr. von Niemann to require human blood or how he exhibits mind control over his servant Emil Robert Frazier never made very clear.Do not watch the technicolor Dr. X 1932  which also stars Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray but as father and daughter  before watching this the way I did; it is an Oscar winner by comparison.

It plods along with too much talking or unnecessary comic relief, without focusing strongly on the vampiric villainy.Besides Dr. X and Mystery of the Wax Museum both 1932 and co starring Fay Wray, Lionel Atwills most famous appearances are as the one armed gendarme in Son of Frankenstein 1939 and as Moriarity in Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon 1943.

In the first fifteen minutes or so of the film there are brief hints of child abuse, domestic violence and a gang rape, but these are all rushed past and then never referred to again. You get the impression that Harron and Guinevere Turner cowriter wanted to gloss over anything that was not glamorous and flattering. You go into this film expecting to gain an insight into who the person behind the posters was, but all you are given is a list of things that she did and recreations of some of her most famous photo shoots.All in all the film really frustrates you as you watch, desperately waiting for some extra layer to reveal itself. How did she balance her religion with her job? What made this young Tennessee girl move from modelling into bondage photography. The film simply shows her going to another modelling agency and putting on whatever she is told, but surely it would have involved some shock and deliberation, this was after all the 50s.It seems to me that Harron is trying to make a point about how tame all this is by todays standards Page never took any photos of explicit sexual actions and how the reaction some gave this kind of thing was really overzealous And although this is true, she never actually makes it seem sordid in the eyes of others. Today we look at a young girl posing topless and think nothing off it, but we should have got some sort of feeling about how shocking it would have been to a contemporary audience. This woman was a central part of a Senate hearing on Juvenile Delinquency, but no one is ever really shown as shocked.Basically I left this film just thinking how tame it was. Harron and Turner have managed to avoid anything that might be unpleasant to a viewer. They come across as two lifelong fans of Miss Page and are desperate to make sure that nothing, absolutely nothing, could possibly put a bad light on their heroine, and have therefore avoided any in depth probing into who she really was.

The most interesting part of this movie is how quaint Ms. Pages naughty photos seem in 2007.

Bettie did not leave the biz because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious issues though she became a bornagain later in life, through the influence of her 3rd husband a minister. She left it, because she was in her late 30s, her acting career had gone nowhere and she felt she was losing her looks. The hints of molestation and rape are unvalidated and denied in Betties own words and are the directors attempts to claim that any woman who did what Bettie did must have been victimized by men. Harron fails to point out that Bettie designed her own clothes in almost all her shoots not handed to her by sick fetishists. Harron also fails to make a point that Bunny Yeager, who did many famous photo shoots of Bettie, also did many naughty shoots with Bettie and was not the morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the film.The only saving grace is Gretchen Mol looks very much like Bettie.

Haddad was not made aware that her new lodger had, in fact, come fresh from The Patton State Mental Hospital where she had been incarcerated for an inexplicable knife attack on a married couple three years previously. Haddad soon realised that something was rotten in Denmark when the woman began to lock herself in the bathroom with a tape recorder reciting prophesies about seven Gods. Haddads fears were confirmed one night when she awoke to find her lodger sitting astride her chest holding a bread knife announcing that God has inspired me to kill you. Haddad managed to knock her assailant out with a telephone but not before she had lost a finger and suffered deep lacerations to her face and chest. It was a miracle she survived. The lodger was judged to be innocent by reason of insanity but sent, kicking and screaming, back to the laughing academy. Ten years later she was released and found that she was now a celebrity; but not for the brutal attacks on her innocent victims, but for her incarnation of 25 years earlier when she was known as the Queen of the Curves, the Tennessee Tease and Miss Pin Up Girl of the World  the Notorious Bettie Page. Director Mary Harron, mainly known for American Psycho takes us back to the glory days of a legendary cheesecake and bondage model played solidly enough by Gretchen Mol who inadvertently wrote the blue print for fetish iconography and whose influence can be detected in everything from comic books to catwalks. T.N.B.P is dayglo fun ride through an evocative depiction of the 1950s where Page, with the familial help of good intentioned boyfriends and photographers, becomes the number one star of pocket sized mens glossies with titles like Wink, Tab and Parade. Her real dream of movie stardom evades her and a brush with the authorities over obscenity charges in 1957 is the inciting incident which leads her to retire from modelling and give herself to God. The overall style of the film is light and frothy and only darkens momentarily with an allusion to her fathers incestuous attentions and a sexual assault which inexplicably appears to have no discernible effect on her. Mol plays Page as she seems in her photographs, happy, carefree and fun  even the bondage shots betray little more than a good humoured incomprehensibility. The film ends on the upbeat with Page cheerfully handing out bibles in a park with no indication of the real life unhappy marriages, personal tragedy and decent into murderous insanity which lay before her; avoiding what I think is the essential core of Pages story  rebirth and resurrection. Having emerged from a decade of incarceration Page found that her cult had been in the ascendance since the mid 1980s and that she had become a huge underground icon, during which, many were asking whatever happened to Bettie Page. Her mysterious disappearance fed the fires of any number of conspiracy theories only adding to the allure of her legend. When the worlds media finally caught up with her she gave no hint of her darker past and she was soon giving interviews for magazines, T.V and being photographed at Playboy parties with the likes of Pamela Anderson and the equally tragic Anna Nicole Smith. She found that she was now more famous than she ever was in her glory years but in the glare of this resurrection it was only a matter of time before the full story would come to light.

But what really annoyed me is that it made Batman look like a sort of wimp who just cannot take care of himself in a battle, without the help of two, even three sidekicks. I mean, he is Batman, for Gods sake! I know the comic books, I know that Nightwing and Batgirl are supposed to be Batmans allies, besides Robin, but still... making Batman say that he needs help from them... What, he cannot handle a few punches? In BTAS, he could face a dozen adversaries without any problem... He is getting old? Come on...And another thing I really do not think that Batman would allow a kid like Tim Drake to go into battle that soon, without years of hard training. One, it is irresponsible and Batman is everything, but irresponsible, and two, it is not what happened in the comics, if we are to remain faithful to them.Batman  The Animated Series made history, with its animation, its stories and its characters...

Of course, Tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly, it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other.

To make matters worse, it is been on the air since 1966, implying that thousands if not millions of people are buying into its hate and lies. Headed by Pat Robertson, the unscrupulous, megalomaniacal founder and leader of the Christian Coalition, The 700 Club takes us from misinformation to misunderstanding, broadcasting news as they like to think of it and trying to convince its audience that all of the worlds problems are to blame on homosexuals, Wiccans, New Age spiritualists, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, nonFundamentalist Christians, Democrats, single mothers, foreigners, feminists, evolutionists, environmentalists, NASA scientists, and anyone else who does not share their fanatical religious views. It is actually the best fake news since The Daily Show or the Weekend Update segment of Saturday Night Live, or since FOX News, for that matter. Of course, Pats always the one who makes each of the decisions, saying whatever comes to mind and not giving a damn who it offends or hurts. In the meantime, he continues his part in the struggle to transform the United States into a militarized police state by having the Religious Wrong stick their noses in everything they can and asking for one donation after another  no less than a measly 100 to become a member, by the way  to fund Pats African diamond mines and buy oil from companies reprimanded by the government in the past for their abuse of the environment. No, never mind that Pat was good friends with the genocidal dictators of Zaire and Zimbabwe in order to help him acquire such wealth; it is all for the greater glory of God, do not you know? And of course, the hosts of The 700 Club are always willing to read letters written by viewers as they like to put it, coincidentally each typed in the same format and all on the same color of paper by viewers supposedly healed of various afflictions by the said hosts they claim to have words of knowledge come to them but who NEVER APPEAR on the program to say what happened to them. Honestly, how can anyone take a show seriously when they are using a poor applause recording? It should make people wonder why there is no studio audience.The sad thing that Pats cronies and viewers do not realize or just do not WANT to realize are the horrible things he is done and said. This is a guy who agreed with Jerry Falwell that the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States were the result of God punishing us for our acceptance of homosexuality and feminism. Ironic, considering that Pat has twice publicly referred to the implementation of a nuclear weapon in the State Department; I have little doubt it was his wealth that kept him from getting arrested for such statements. His rants against homosexuals, single mothers, and any number of sexual practices he considers sinful are interesting, considering he was known to frequent a number of brothels during the Korean War. As the Bible says, be fruitful and multiply, so congratulations, Pat  thanks to you, there is probably a number of children born to single Korean mothers. Then, of course, there was the time he called for the assassination of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez not that he is a saint, but still. Oh, yes, and let us not soon forget the time this crusader for human life supported forced abortions in China. Very Christian of him, would not you say?And just in case Pat has forgotten, I have not forgotten his little speech that evangelical Christians today are being treated exactly as the Jews were in Nazi Germany. Honestly, to compare his plight to the horrors of the Holocaust is almost unforgivable. Speaking of which, need I mention about how he blatantly lied that homosexuality ran rampant among the Nazi party in a pathetic attempt to discredit homosexuals? Of course, history shows us that the Nazis acted toward homosexuals the same way they acted toward Jews. Pat Robertson is one of the biggest liars in history. If he was Pinocchio, his nose would encircle the Earth.Unfortunately, more and more people continue to believe him every day. This is your wakeup call, people; The 700 Club is one of the most if not the single most vile program in television history. It is evil masquerading as good; it is a wolfinsheepsclothing. It is bigoted filth that tries to look clean, pretty, and loving. It is living proof that hateful, dangerous religious views are not confined to certain groups in the Middle East. Even those who are not of the Christian faith know that it goes against everything Jesus taught, and if Jesus was to appear to this club, He would not be emulating them. Instead, He would be chastising them as He did the Pharisees of His time and overturning the money bins of their telethons as He did in front of the synagogue in His time.

They are todays equivalent to the Ku Klux Klan of the 20th century. Their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand. Their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of Americans, as well as billions of humans the world over, who do not happen to share their bigoted, cruel, monstrous, and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen. The lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth, such as the idea of life after death or god or sin or the devil is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill, so lost are they in their fantasy. Sane people know that religion is a drug and should not let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy. However, The 700 Club is in a class by itself. They are truly a cult. While I believe in freedom of speech, they way they spread hatred, lies, disinformation, and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits. I hope that one day the American Psychiatric Association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way, people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all. Treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country, as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion. The 700 Club though, is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of cult but due to The 700 Clubs vast wealth conned daily from the millions of Americans locked in their deceitful grip they are above the law in this country. For those of you who have seen the movie The Matrix you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes, and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them.In less civil times, the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with The 700 Club out of town with torches and pitchforks. But in todays world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them, we have no way to rid ourselves of the 700 Club plague.

He really needs a personality transplant.","label":0},{"index":3961,"txt":"Years have gone by since Don Wilson used his martial arts expertise to take down a robot who was programmed to destroy him, he is also married to the blonde reporter Stacie Foster who led the rebellion in the first film, now a new conspiracy is in the works, one that involves lookalike droids who frame our two heroes, and a corporation looking to rule the world There is no plot to back any of this up and Cyber Tracker 2 becomes a virtual replay of the first movie. I admit that I have bought DVDs from the bargain bin that were made by PM, PM was a company that specialized in cheapjack action flicks like this which had tons of explosions, little story and overall nothing but mean edged action. Some of these titles have been mildly enjoyable Last Man Standing and The Sweeper however Cyber Tracker 2 is stuck with the casting of the charismaless Don Wilson. When comparing the protagonists of similar PM efforts both Jeff Wincott and C. Thomas Howell are Oscar nominees when compared to Don Wilson. Another telling sign is that this was directed by Richard Pepin who has none of the flair Joseph Merhi seems to have in crafting action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets. Then again though both C. Thomas and Wincott are probably more expensive to obtain. Cyber Tracker 2 is a rip off with a capitol R, there are so many steals from better movies Robocop, Terminator, Universal Soldier to even Halloween III! that it is almost as if Richard Pepin is trying to infuse a sense of identity to the pedestrian material yet without the intelligent ideas or at least the mindless zip of great action, Cyber Tracker 2 falls flat. There is literally no good idea that is not borrowed from a better movie and the supporting cast overact. The only exception comes from Tony Burton who is miles better than the material. Also Stacie Foster looks like she could be better with far better material. However Cyber Tracker 2 comes off mainly as noisy, bland and lackluster as its leading man, however with no real martial arts sequences to fall back on, all there is, is lots of cars tipping over and that alone is no substitute for the bankruptcy of ambition expressed here.12 out of 4Poor","label":0},{"index":3962,"txt":"Having read during many years about how great this film was, how it established Ruiz among the french critics specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd, when I finally watched it about a year ago, I found it pretty disappointing but then, I guess my expectations were skyhigh. Shot in saturated black and white, this deliberately cerebral film made for TV, and mercifully, only an hour long is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an offscreen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime.

Luckily the movie do not contain much of KunG Fu fighting and much are enchanced by stunners and visual effects...I think that Jays acting is still a pain to watch, especially when almost everyone else in the film is so much better.

I do not think so.This show is purely for Jay Chou fans, and the film lacks a depth in terms of character development, cinematography styles and unfolding of plot.Anybody notice that the captain of the basket team forgot his name and the idolized player Li Xiao look so similar to each other, to the extent that you would think they were the one and same person? Long hair, sunshineboy look, tall and strong. The two of them looked like they came out from a mass production factory designed to churn out products that makes teenage girls scream wild in orgasm. Not that those two actors had anything of value to contribute to the movie as a whole for the movie industry at all.The jokes were lame and not funny at all.The scene with regards to the 4 masters of Jay Chou coming back to help him out in the basketball court, degenerated into a pointless plot when they started bashing their opponents ala Royal Rumble style. Worse of all, when the 4 masters won the fight, the crowd began cheering, and the match continued. It was truly a WTF? moment.At the end of the show, when they win the match, all thanks to Jay Chous excellent kung fu skills. How he acquired those kungfu skills is a mystery, because the show somehow shows him acquiring the skills just by observing his master.And then his longlost father comes out of the woodwork to acknowledge Jay Chou as his longlost son seemed just a tad too quick of the director to wrap up the film.In short, this is a Jay Chouflick instead of the usual chick flick.

He wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason I already forgot. Combs gets his instructions from mentor. That guy only exists of a pair of eyes in space. Very very cheesy, that is !

This was her first movie role and she did a very nice job, considering hers is the most challenging part. Ron Livingston was adequate but bland as Patrick, the American whose quest is to save Holly, but Chris Penn was good in this, his final role. Unfortunately, despite my mostly favourable opinion of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier, both of these actors were very much forgettable and did not do their best work in this film.I believe in the films message and intention, but I have to be fair, so I rate Holly 3 stars based on its shortcomings as a movie.

They were poor, they were black, and they were living proof that if you have Jesus and your family that nothing is too hard. Sure James would lose jobs and JJ would fail in school but the family always managed to find a way. James was the strong male role model that earned the income and disciplined the children. Florida was the strong lady that would everyone including James when he needed a shoulder to cry on or hug to make it. The kids had personalities and input which made them important as a family unit. Their neighbor Willona was also a key element because she represented not only a friend but some dear enough to be family. Things were bright, gritty, funny, and honest until they changed the course of the program. James dies and JJ took over the show. Flo was still mom, Thelma was blossoming into a lady and Michael was still the militant midget but JJ was the show. We were expected to believe that the family with no father or prominent bread winner was going to be able to stay in the apartment. I guess Jamess paycheck did not do much for the family. They were only threatened with eviction because they said they were moving and not because no one in the house was working. I know that JJ, Flo, Thelma and even Michael eventually got jobs but come on here be for real. James worked so much that you could feel for him but the others were not realistic at all and that is a shame.JJ was the comic relief but I felt the show need substance. It is OK to be funny but they had a chance to show a real family and what it took to survive in the real world and they threw it all away on a few laughs. Michaels character almost disappeared while the rest of the cast slipped into the shadows of the JJ Evans show. I mean really, here was a guy that was failing in school, he kept getting laid off, and he painted for money in about two episodes. James had always been there to encourage his talent but Flo and the rest of the family did not seem to care.Why did it take him so long to understand that painting was what he was meant to do? He could have sold paintings on the street or worked for people that print billboards and cards. He did but something went wrong with that. Why did he not make it and why did the others give up on their dreams? I will tell you why, it was because they did not have a father in their life to care and to cheer them on and their mother stopped being their to support their dreams.

Beware, this writeup is LONG.For those not in the knowing mostly the nonBelgians  Tom Barman, director of this film, is the frontman of dEUS, one of the better known rock bands of the late 90s here in Belgium. Basically, they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale. Then, egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart, with Barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the dEUSmonicker. The way it always happens in such cases, the postbreakdown dEUS was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original. They tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album The Ideal Crash in 1999, presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting. They did not quite make it. However, egos were still pretty big it seems  big enough for Barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies.More often than not this sort of thing is a VERY big mistake, and this film does not make the exception. And Barman clearly went for art on this one, another very big mistake. For one thing, he is a musician, not a movie director. For another, dEUS at it is best made fun and provoking music, but never anything close to what I would consider art. It shows.So, what is this movie about? Basically, it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people, doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in Antwerp, as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting. The characters are shallow, the plot totally pointless and the film just does not have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings. Humor? The whole film made me smile slightly about 3 times, and actually managed to provoke a single 5second laugh not quite loud. Mood? The film just does not seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all. Mystery? Well, MINOR SPOILERthe idea of the windman, inspiring the name of the film, is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza  not very, and has been done a thousand times before anyone remember Johny Destiny  one of Tarantinos worst appearances on film to dateEND MINOR SPOILER. And well, its artistic, so do not expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous. In other words, except for the few smiles, it bored me out of my shorts.So what remains? Well, the soundtrack is pretty good, though it suffers from some of the same problems that other OSTs have shown lately  first, it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the CD. Second, it gives the impression that Barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs, which simply does not work. In the end, it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs. And sadly, it is Barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention, though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as I am concerned. All in all, it just stands to show that Barman knows more about music than movies. Camera work is okay as well, though not anything that would make you scream out with joy.The only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sightseeing factor. Since I originate from Antwerp, it was fun to play a kind of guessthelocation game. I would hardly consider this as a quality though.All in all, another chance lost for Flemmish film. I keep on noticing that lately, the best Belgian movies have been coming from the French part of the country.

This is especially the case when the writerdirector of this particular film is already a nations sweetheart, because he is also the founder and lead singer of a popular rock band. Any Way The Wind Blows is by no means a bad film, but it is definitely overrated if that is even possible within the boundaries of a small country and has absolutely nothing new or even remotely original to offer. This is basically the Flemish version of classic movies such as Short Cuts and Magnolia and illustrates a mosaic of characters whose daily lives initially appear to be unrelated but eventually come together in the end. The only thing that seems to unite the eight protagonists at first is the city of Antwerp, where they all live and work, but gradually the deeper relationships between them become transparent and near the climax they all gather for a party. The main problem with Any Way The Wind Blows, at least according to yours truly, lies with the characters. They really are random, uninteresting and honestly do not experience anything that could be considered out of the ordinary. It was presumably writerdirector Tom Barmans intention to depict the average  regular inhabitant of Antwerp but then, seriously, what is the point? One of the characters gets fired from his film projectionist job, another one is a failed novelist struggling with a marriage crisis, two siblings recently lost their father and the most mysterious one of them all is followed by the wind wherever he goes. There are a couple of more characters regularly walking through the screen, but they are even less worth mentioning. These people simply drivel on and on about very random topics like life in the 80s, dates and each others bowel motions and philosophy about matters nobody cares about. Some of the dialogs do evoke mild chuckles, especially the interactions between the two twentysomething guys from Ghent, but still nothing extraordinary or even memorable. The film actually works best as a touristy video to promote the city of Antwerp and as an extended  versatile music documentary. There are several stylish  nifty sightseeing images of Antwerp and there is always beautiful music playing, whether really loud or subtly in the background. Generally speaking Any Way The Wind Blows is a competently made and stylish effort, but too mundane and slightly boring, and I honestly wonder most of its fans would even had bothered to watch if it were not a Flemish production.","label":0},{"index":3993,"txt":"To me this just comes off as a soap opera. I guess any depiction of profligate people can be considered social commentary. But in the final analysis, I simply do not care how you characterize this film. None of the characters are very likable or engaging. I felt no chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story here, it is lost in the malaise. And despite the twist ending provided by a complete and immediate and therefore, incomprehensible reversal by Dorothy Maguire on the witness stand, the story is insufficient to hold my interest. No matter how much Freudian symbolism and psychology are throw in, this story is sleazy, melodramatic and trite.Rock Hudson is nobly wooden. This is Lauren Bacalls least engaging role and one of her poorest performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack deliver more inspired performances, but her character is vile, and his is pathetic. Robert Keith, as the loving, outoftouch father of two miscreant adult children, is the most sympathetic character. Most interesting of all, however, is the severelooking Robert Wilke in a small role as the bar owner. He is best remembered as a nasty henchman in countless Westerns, but here he is an honest, likable fellow.I take my social commentary with an interesting, engaging story and a few likable characters, thank you.","label":0},{"index":3994,"txt":"I watched Written on The Wind starring Rock Hudson,Lauren Becall,Robert Stack  Dorothy Malone Robert Stack was terrible just bloody horrible he was supposed to be a charming jetsetting millionaire instead he came off like a jerk from the word go the plot was stupid and overwrought and the 3 romantic leads had no chemistry. Somehow Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for best supporting actress although her campy tramp character was boring think the older sister from Splendour in The Grass filled with malice and bitterness and lacking charisma. Director Douglas Sirk has the entire cast overact their way through dialogue that felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes. Had a cameo by the actor that played the chief on Get Smart","label":0},{"index":3995,"txt":"I saw this film for the first time not too long on TCMs Essentials series. The eye of the beholder clich\u00e9 was never more apropos. This beholder saw little of value in this one. I was puzzled by the infinite attraction that Lucy Lauren Bacall possessed. Granted, Ms. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this film her character comes off more mousy than attractive. I would think men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would more likely ignore Lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her. In Bacalls defense, this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogarts last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health may have affected her performance. Of course part of this mousiness on the part of Lucy was to contrast her to slutty Marylee, played to the hilt and beyond by Dorothy Malone. The scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film. Malones performance outshines the rest, although Jasper Hadleys weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. Generally, though, I would have to say that I am just not much of a fan of melodrama. The cartoonish behavior of the characters just makes for a story too implausible for my tastes.","label":0},{"index":3996,"txt":"First, let me state that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd; that is why I was curious to check out this, her debut role. No argument that her talent is apparent and her performance excellent. I guess I can also see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and that is where this movie fails.By the halfway point, I found myself thinking, How much longer do we have to watch a bored shop girl, idly standing around a deserted souvenir shop, rearranging the merchandise? It seemed to go on forever!Then, I thought, maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to lull the audience into a relaxed state before hitting them with some dynamic event. No such luck. The movie continues it is bland, boring, uneventful story all the way to the end.I am not saying this because I am an actionjunkie. I like all kinds of movies, especially romanticcomedies. But I expect to be entertained.Add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbors bad home movies. Depressing!I just do not get how anyone could like this movie. Zeroentertainment value. The longest 114 minutes of my life.","label":0},{"index":3997,"txt":"Ashley Judd, in an early role and I think her first starring role, shows her reallife rebellious nature in this slowmoving feminist soap opera. Wow, is this a vehicle for political correctness and extreme Liberalism or what?Being a staunch feminist in real life, she must have cherished this script. No wonder Left Wing critic Roger Ebert loved this movie; it is right up his political alley, too.Unlike the reviewers here, I am glad Judd elevated herself from this moronic fluff to better roles in movies that entertained, not preached the heavyhanded Liberal agenda.","label":0},{"index":3998,"txt":"There was a great film to be made about Steve Biko. Sadly this was not it. Denzel Washington  never the most flexible of actors  is totally unable to convey the great charisma that Biko had. Attenboroughs big crowd scenes are laughable. The Soweto massacre was not like this, three neat lines of children  some doing cartwheels! marching happily into the guns of the soldiers. With Biko dead the film rapidly descends into farce. If the struggle against Apartheid was anything it was a black peoples struggle yet somehow we are all supposed to be gripped by the escape of a white man and his family. I am sure Donald Woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that Biko was important while he was not. Penelope Wiltons accent is pure Hampshire and she seems completely unaware that she is in South Africa at all. at all. The Woods family dog gets more lines than the black maid. As the family make their escape one the women I saw the film with  incidentally one of only about a dozen black people in a large, full cinema  whispered This is like the sound of music. She had a point.Overall this is a film by a wellintentioned if somewhat inept white liberal about a radical black peoples struggle. And really South Africa needs wellintentioned white liberals like it needs a hole in the head.","label":0},{"index":3999,"txt":"This film was choppy, incoherent and contrived. It was also an extremely meanspirited portrayal of women. I rented it because it was listed as a comedy that is a stretch, and because the cover said Andie McDowell was acting up a storm in it. She was not. I am a gal, I watched this film with two guys, and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was.WARNING PLOT SUMMARY BELOW! RAMPANT SPOILERS!The movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man, to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends. They want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her. But she is so happy with her oversexed puppy that you are rooting for them to stick it out, and sure enough, she decides to marry the guy. But her harpy girlfriend, aided by the wishywashy one, sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her. It works. She has a fight with him, he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck Remember the movies title? So now he is dead, twothirds of the way through the film. And although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls, she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant.She is already broken off relations with her girlfriends, because they were so unsupportive. Alone and pitiful, she decides to marry the boring guy. Did I mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister? She had asked him to marry her to the young guy nice, huh?, but now she tells him she will marry him, and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion. But her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home, where they notquiteconfess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed. She has the kid. In the final scene, they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink, smoke and be smug. I kid you not, it is that bad. I left out the part about the cancer redherring and the harpys ridiculous lesbian moment.","label":0}]}
