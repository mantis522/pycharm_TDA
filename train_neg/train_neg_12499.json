Amanda Walsh was good in it as the eye candylove interest, while Matt Lanter was good as the other main lead that is about it.

The idea that a teenager could do anything of far reaching proportions, let alone deter a world war was novel and thrilling. Real computers were beginning to show up in peoples homes, and for the first time, society was becoming interconnected in a way that made the movies premise excitingly prescient. Granted, a talking computer that balanced it is free time between chess and global thermonuclear war was a bit far fetched, but the brilliant commentary on nuclear proliferation and the cold war made up for it. I have probably even heard of the hackers that this movie was actually based on.Fast forward 25 years, and we have a horrible mutant of a thing that I loathe to call a sequel, called Wargames The Dead Code. I will just dig right in. First of all, the plot hinges on a government operated gambling site where folks who win the games automatically become terror suspects. You are probably very confused right now. The idea is that eventually the terrorist will click on the subgame within the web site called The Dead Code where they pilot a plane over a city, spraying it with bioweapons. At some point in the game, you have to choose between sarin gas and anthrax, and if you choose sarin, then you are automatically confirmed as a bioterrorism weapons expert and your family is taken into custody and interrogated. In the movie, this actually happens. However, since the payment for the game was made from a bank account that was suspicious, it obviously all makes sense.Second, the avatar of the AI in this straighttoDVD bomb is an annoying flash animation that keeps repeating the popupadesquire sound bite play with me baby. Because apparently in the future, advanced AI loses interest in intellectual pursuits like chess, and gets into porn.Third, the motivation for these hackers is profit and women, as opposed to pure curiosity as in the original movie. For some reason, recent hacker movies feel the need to portray all young adults as average surfer dude kind of people who are just like everyone else. That may work for your average sitcom, but cmon, you do not learn how to take over government computers by doing your hair, playing sports, and shopping at the mall, folks. The one novel thing I noticed was that at some point in the dialogue there is a reference to a Matt Damon movie, and then later there is the phrase, Good Hunting, Will. I swear, they named the main character Will just for that phrase so they could send a high five to Mr. Damon. This Will kid is not bad, but he was certainly was not like any obsessive hacker I have ever met. I cannot fully state how annoyed I am that this movie shares the same name as the original, because it has absolutely nothing in common with it except\u0085 Professor Falken and Joshua WOPR make a reappearance in this movie, as a limp old man who apparently is dying of boredom, and a dilapidated old tictactoe machine with a higher pitched voice. After some prodding, Joshua the AI has what appears to be sex with the new AI with the porn voice, a bunch of board games flash on the big screens, and the whole The only way to win, is not to play revelation is supposed to be the crowning moment. Except that those of us who saw the original, you know, those who would want to see this in the first place have already been there and done that. A recycled ending for a movie made from last months compost.The new movie was directed by a guy who is done 90210, and written by guys who do B movies. The original was directed by a guy who is been keeping himself busy with Heroes, so you see the quality difference there. There was talk of a real remake, but I hope they do not destroy this classic all over again. I swear, if I have to, I will visit every gambling web site until I find the one that is run by a psychotic government computer. The saving grace is that I was able to stream this on Netflix, so at least the only energy I expended watching this disaster was for breathing, clicking, and indigestion.","label":0},{"index":12005,"txt":"This movie is mostly chase scenes and special effects.

Most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic of real computers and networks, but just lame.

Why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin. Let us start with the actors;they are not all that good, but it has to be said, some make heads turn by being just plain awful. But what can an actor do with a script like this one. It is trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed, any form of story is gone and any attempt of actually coming up with something that has not been done before, fails miserably. In a futile attempt to get it uptodate, they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole bigbrother theme , but that has been worn out ages ago and offers nothing but a filler for between the beginning and the end. An attempt was made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the 83 original, but it just ended up being plain funny and sometimes a bit sad.

It is a musical and for the most part you will remember VeraEllens dancing. You will remember that they are in Scots costume as the film is set in Edinburgh during their festival. But if you can recall a single song from it you must have a photographic memory.The plot is light.

She gets a lift from the chauffeur of a millionaire greeting card king. Everybody now assumes she is the main squeeze of the millionaire. Doors open up as they have never opened before.The millionaire is David Niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by the mistake.

It is set in the modern day as we see a base in Afghanistan get destroyed by a UAV right at the start.And that is exactly where the movie jumps the shark. UAVs are not armed. They could be but I do not think it is ever been tried for real. We get to see the computer that has masterminded this operation, called R.I.P.L.E.Y. We are introduced to hacker Will Farmer he is good at chemistry  electronics which does not make him a computer hacker  his love interest, Annie  Wills 1st attempt at hacking is not only a complete failure his IP address is also logged and Annie guessed who it was. We also meet Wills mom who works for a chemical company.Wills taking money from his neighbours bank account Mr Massude is not a hack he helped him set up the account, we then get a nod back to the original movie where they decide against playing Global Thermonuclear War  they play The Dead Code. The trace the RIPLEY office are running is NOT on Will but on Massudes pc so all the evidence they were gathering was useless against Will.Exactly why RIPLEY shut Wills machine down is not explained he is only playing an online game?  also why it felt the need to have to shut down all the electricity in the entire block he lived in as well. Why a counter terrorism agency would see this as a viable target is extremely questionable. As for RIPLEY activating his mobile phone? I think not, it was not connected to the pc and the message would not play unless he actually answered the phone so there is more bad hacking science there too.RIPLEY agents arrive at Massudes home, take him away  Will is given a envelope which turns out to contain a lot of money. Will searching for the licence plate of the car that took Massude is not a hack as you never see him break into the DMV computer. The RIPLEY agents who grab Dennis in the airport as he is looking for Will have no authority to arrest or detain him. Wills mother had not been stealing chemicals  Bio agents either. And even if she did they had no right to arrest or detain Dennis. Patriot Act or not.I do not know why Will was worried about being arrested for any crime in Canada as its a totally different country with different laws to the US.The computer has gone rogue and all the action its taken against Will, his mother  Dennis was not sanctioned by a Government agency. The phone phreak we see Will do is the 1st show of any hacking skill in the movie, we also get a hack into RIPLEY which seemed too easy for such a powerful system.The guy who ran into Annie at the airport  was also watching them in the street was nothing to do with RIPLEY  the laughable notion that RIPLEY could track a cellphone whilst underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer reads lips.Another reference to the original movie when they mention Stephen Falken as the designer of the system RIPLEY replaced, the Joshua Project. We discover that the guy who ran into Annie is Falken not played by the original actor sadly who faked his own death.We also get to see WOPR as what is going to help them beat RIPLEY and they kept the same voice used back then. Falken  WOPR are destroyed too quickly after being hardly used at all the same explosion should kill Will, Annie  the Russian. It is also unlikely they would create a selfcontained computer system that has the ability to nuke or drop chemical weapons on the country it operates out of.The whole Decontamination plot  idea are totally unbelievable. Those kinds of orders would have to go through the President or Joint Chiefs Of Staff. So yet another laughable  unbelievable idea.The IP hacks against RIPLEY are not done by Will, he just contacts one of his friends who suggests  implements the idea. It is excessively laughable that Will would get a login just from increasing RIPLEYs operating temperature. Having Joshua as a backdoor into RIPLEY especially after it had been blown to bits is an incredible copout and screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas left and wanted to get this movie over and done with.There is an awful good where RIPLEY is playing Dead Code and we see a countdown saying 17 minutes then RIPLEY says Decontamination in 30 minutes, how crap is that when they cannot even keep up with their own timer? RIPLEYs attack mission against Philadelphia is halted far too easily in my opinion and it decides to attack Joshua in its internal circuits and reroutes the missile aimed a Philly to Washington where RIPLEY is stationed. The idea of the Nuclear exchange to make RIPLEY realise what she is doing will not work surely she would already know if she had Joshua insider her as he would already learnt this lesson in the original movie? is yet another nod back to the original movie.Their copout at having RIPLEY repeat Joshuas exact same words form the end of the original movie just goes to show how many original ideas they were unable to come up with.If you want to point fingers for bad  stolen ideas the men to blame are Randall Badat  Rob Kerchner.

The pious but naive preacher Stephen Kumalo James Earl Jones receives a letter from Johannesburg saying that he must come immediately; he later finds that his son has killed a man.

The music does not help. The painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film. One upside is the cinematography, with many rather good or great shots, but unfortunately, this does not help the film too much.The last, striking words of Alan Patons novel are displayed in the last moments of the film.

Offhand I can recall only a few films in which architecture played a major role throughoutDemon Seed, Cube, the remake of Thirteen Ghostsbut it is at the heart of every story about a spooky house or church or crypt; it is all about the character and the affect of spaces, passages, and walls. So I was looking forward to this thriller where it promised to be central. The idea is this An architect has builtactually, rebuiltfor himself a huge and rambling house; his wife has just left him, mainly because of his own selfcenteredness, but also, it is intimated, because she cannot get used to the place since he remodeled it. Living in unaccustomed solitude real this time, rather than virtual, he comes to suspect that somebody elsea stranger who had come to the door one evening asking to use the phone and then suddenly disappearedis living into the house with him; only the place is big enough so that he never sees him.This is a good start for a melodrama, whose development one would expect to follow some such lines as these After searching the house for the intruder a few times without success, the architect resorts to his blueprints to undertake more systematic searches, trying in various ways to surprise, intercept, or ambush the intruder, maybe by means of some special features he built into the structure. Meanwhile the intruder has discovered hiding places and back ways between places that the architect did not foresee or does not remember. The movie would turn into a catandmouse game, a hunt, a battle; and finally, in trying to trap the intruder, the architect himself would end up trapped in his own creation, in some way he did not expect. Then he would be forced to think himself out of itand maybe at the same time out of his own selfimposed isolationand in a final twist would nail, and maybe even kill, the er.Nothing like this happens in this movie; the house is just a house, the architect is just a guy, and his nemesis is of an unknown character, if he exists at all. Here is what does happen in the movie Once the intruder is installed in the houseif he isthe architect begins hearing noises, but when he goes to investigate finds nothing. He calls the police, they think he is slightly nuts; he persuades his estranged wife to spend the night, she thinks he is more nuts. At last, more or less accidentally, he runs into the intruder does not get a good look, but figures, who else could it be?not a hard question, in a story with, to that point, fewer than three principal characters, whereupon he locks the doors, lowers the grills on the windows, throws away the key I do not know why he thought this necessary, and leaves his victim to starve. I missed why this was a given the doors and walls are made of steel? In any event, the architect takes to sleeping in his car. And since the idea of the movie has languished undeveloped and cannot now be developed further, something else must be devised to take its place. And this is it The architectare you ready?moves into the house of the man who presumably moved into his, and lives there in the same way. How is this possible? It is not, but the movie takes this route to try and make it seem so The architect has drawn a picture of the man who came to his door; and when he leaves the house he takes the picture with him; and while sitting in his car, he throws the picture into the street; and two kids pick it up and observe that it looks like Martin, their neighbor; whereupon the architect asks where his house is and the kids point the way.If this sequence seems to verge on the implausible, what ensues plunges right in. The architect takes up residence with Martins wheelchairridden wife, unbeknownst to her; so stealthy in his moves and so cunning in his reading of his hostess that he is able always to leave a room just as she enters or to duck out of sight just as she turns around. Throughout this section the movie is clever in one way, making or leaving it to the viewer to make the point that his life with this stranger, who does not know he is there, is in essence the same life he lived with his wife, as a virtual recluse with her as a convenient buffer.

It could have been dubbed the Moulin Rouge of the 80s, but it disappeared. It made its very shallow mark on the world, snuck under the radar, and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section, the comedy section, or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that does not need chain money to survive. Alas, that was not where I found it \u0096 but I found it, watched it, tried my hardest to sing along with it, stared into Bowies eyes, but found myself faded by the end. Did it not survive the test of time? Is 1950s London too far removed from our current society? Is Bowie too creepy? I think Absolute Beginners falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang, but withers to a mere sparkle by the end.Absolute Beginners opens with a huge number that takes us through the nongritty streets of London which involve theft nightly, prostitutes on every corner, dance throughout, booze like rivers, and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual. Sounds like a place we would all hate to be \u0085 right? Director Julien Temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters. The one we follow most is Colin played by Eddie OConnell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl, Suzette played by Patsy Kensit. These two have chemistry, and while Suzette looks like a prerehab Lohan, to me they worked. There was a huge spark between them, the chemistry was like lava, and I believed that these two could take me down a road I had never traveled. I was ready \u0096 but then, something happened. Temple takes us out of the nightlife, takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning, and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first. Suzette runs away, Colin becomes a pervert, and Bowie \u0085 well \u0085 I am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain \u0096 I can tell you that much. Temple gives us this flashy city, this opportunity to see those that inhabit it, but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger. We learn about Colin, mainly, but nobody else. I could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom, and what importance fashion had to that era. Also, were they teens really \u0096 they all seemed like they were pushing their late 20s, but maybe it was my TV.Character development thrown right out the door, Temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger, more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about. One of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example. Temple uses a split house to show us the lives of Colins parents of which I did not know it was them until after the film and a song which screams apathy. Great song, too many characters, not enough time, suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency, and it just falls apart in your hands. Then, if that was not enough, we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs, rubbing our noggin trying to understand where our characters are or are going, and Temple throws in hatred, anger, and politics into the final act. While I was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme, I did not think racism would be on the top of the bill. Suddenly, friends are missing, people are angry, and there is some random guy running around fighting Colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race? Somebody help me out here. It seemed completely rushed and overwhelming \u0096 nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off. To me, the ending of Absolute Beginners was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number. That first part set the pace, and Temple could not keep up.Overall, I must say that Temple can direct a music video, but I do not think he was quite prepared for the feature film. I do not think this film will ever make it into full cult status, and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come. It is a fun film to watch initially, but when we get to that final part, it just explodes from the inside. I wanted some cutting edge work, but instead what I found was a freaky Bowie coupled with characters I cared nothing for. I could see how this film could relate to the youth of the 80s, but by the end it just felt forced. I think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to Motivation by the everfreaky Bowie in this film, it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status. I am glad that I watched this film once, but that is all that my small brain can take. I loved the way that Temple caught me from the beginning, but he could not control his characters way too many, and the songs did not seem to match the final moments of the film. It came out of nowhere, and it was unwelcomed. If this was a film about racism, it needed to be from the beginning. Absolute Beginners was a welcomed adventure, but I do not think I will be dusting this film off in the future.Grade  out of ","label":0},{"index":12041,"txt":"This movie is horrible if you pay attention to it. It is a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen  each one with no apparent connection to the next.

In finality, Bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired. The moral of the story was really befuddling. I could not tell if it was about racial issues in London in the 1950s or about not selling out. For the first half of the movie I was chuckling at how cheesy it was but I liked the campiness of the no selling out message. When blacks started being murdered I thought my tape had gotten messed up. Maybe I rented half of two different movies? Nope, there was a Keep Britain White song and dance sequence.

In addition to suffering from looking too 1980s, the characters have been changed, rearranged, and downplayed to the point that the only characteristics they have in common with those of the novel are the slightest superficial looks and, of course, their names Suze is transformed from the narrators flighty exgirlfriend and promiscuous negrophile who willingly plans to marry a closeted old queen for money at her own admittance in the first few pages into a hapless and naive Evearchetype seduced by fame and glamour, exploited and somehow scammed into a sham marriage by her boss, who surprisingly was not given a Van Dyke and pointy hairstyle. She and the narrator, renamed Colin after the books author, Colin MacInnes for the film, are also in a relationship.Big Jills character, a lesbian seemingly butch yet fop like in her mid20s who acts as pimp to a cadre of young and bubbleheaded lesbians, and one of the narrators closest friends, dispensing frank wisdom to the narrator, is reduced to a sort of named extra with only a few throwaway lines, and tonnes of comical outfits.The Fabulous Hoplite, a gay young man and another close friend of the narrator in the novel, is also reduced to the point of being pointless in the film, campedup and all but ignored.The narrators father in the novel is a sort of sad minor character but in the film, he is played to come off as optimistic and oddly spirited despite the squalid neighbourhood, and the disarray of his marriage to the narrators mum seems, for all practical purposes, ignored.In its favour, the music for what it is is wellcomposed, and you have to give the production and writing crews credit for actually taking a line from the book ...some days, they will write musicals about the 1950s... as their inspiration to write a musical, but in the world of bad campedup musicals, this is among the most poorly executed in the bunch. Unlike _Shock Treatment_ or _Starstruck_ crucial plot elements are treated as afterthoughts. Unlike _The Apple_, there is a choppy and uneven flow between musical numbers and spoken dialogue.You really cannot blame it is too 1980s feel on the fact that it was created in the 1980s. The film version of _Annie_ released in 1981, pays a wonderfully wellexecuted tribute to the look and feel of New York City in the 1930s, and _Napolean Dynamite_ manages to capture a gritty sort of look and feel of the 1980s despite being made on a low budget in 2003 though it is not explicitly set in the 1980s, those who lived through the decade cannot deny that the film feels very 1980s. Obviously, it was _possible_ to make something good out of this, especially considering the iconic status that the source novel has in the UK, but it fails most apparently in the look and feel, and also in its treatment of the source material, which is downright disrespectful.Perhaps if you have not read and have no intentions of reading the novel, you could enjoy this campy 1980s anachronism giving a shameful parody of late1950s Soho Londons modernist jazz set. I can definitely see what the writing team were attempting, but they definitely could have done better. With Boy George as a household name and mixedrace musicians and bands on the charts in 1986 UK, they definitely did _not_ need to bowdlerise the characters in the ways that they ended up doing. In fact, I would go so far as saying that the writers wound up doing what both the book and film criticised harshly  it ended up having a bunch of adults cranking out crap and treating its targeted teenaged audience like twobit idiots to make a quick buck off of.","label":0},{"index":12045,"txt":"I have seen the movie only recently, although it appeared in 2001.

Robert seems to always have at least three women in his life one mistress on her way out, one on her way in, and the cheated wife at home. It helps that Robert is a glib liar. Among his most useful lies are I will call you tomorrow and My work took longer than planned. He spends a lot of time and money on planes, trains and hotel rooms for his succession of liaisons. You wonder when this guy will get caught with his pants down.Some may find his life exciting, but I thought it to be tedious. His companions, including his wife, Catherine, are all attractive and desirable women. But his lifestyle is so hectic and he is so deceitful, you wonder if he is enjoying all this.Adding to the tedium is considerable footage that does not further the plot. There are extended sections with no dialogue or Frenchonly dialogue. We see documentaries of wars, torture, and troop training interspersed with the live action. When Roberts flight returns from Africa, we wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminal.Annie Girardot is the standout performer in this film. Hers was the most interesting character and she played it to perfection. It was also nice to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career. I cannot find fault with Yves Montands performance of what was basically an amoral bum.I enjoyed some of Claude Lelouchs novel techniques. In a hotel room scene, the camera pans around the room as Robert and his mistress argue. We catch sight of them briefly during each pass around the room. In another scene set on a sleeping car of a train, Robert is lying on the upper bunk while his wife is on the lower. Robert is giving his wife some important but distressing news, but we hear only parts of it because of the clatter of the train.

This ending line actually sums up everything that has gone before it; as Rino Di Silvestros messy film completely lacks vision, and if there is any point to the plot; it was not put there on purpose. Werewolf Woman is often seen as a guilty pleasure or a so bad it is good film, but I completely disagree. Normally, I enjoy films like this; but Werewolf Woman is indeed a bad film, and despite all the sex and savagery on display; it does not even make for a fun watch, and that really is unforgivable. The film really does not have much plot, but the thin sliver we are given involves a young woman, who also happens to dream that she is a werewolf. She dreams of going out and finding men, having sex with them and eventually killing them. Back in the real world, she falls in love, but her lover is killed and she goes out for revenge...The film is made up of scenes of sex and gore, which are padded out with extremely dull talking sequences in which various characters mull over the recent events. These scenes are probably there to forward the plot and build characters; but they really do not do that, and succeed only in turning what could have been a passable exploitation romp into an extremely underwhelming film. It would seem that the director was more interested in style and atmosphere than the plot, and this is shown by the fact that the film looks and sounds nice. The sex scenes are often overlong and not very erotic, but the gore works well. The premise is ripe for giving way to a very sexy slice of exploitation, as there is plenty of naked women, and the fact that the central character has a werewolf origin means that there could be plenty of erotica; but this is not capitalised on, and while I can stomach huge doses of bad acting and poorly done plot lines, I really cannot stand watching films and being bored. Overall, I would not even recommend this film to big exploitation fans. There is plenty of better stuff than this out there, and while the title may sound intriguing  the film is not.","label":0},{"index":12057,"txt":"Daniella has some issues brewing under her attractive exterior.

Traumatized again by these latest events, the woman returns to her violent ways and seeks revenge on the thugs, according to the DVD sleeves synopsis.Rino Di Silvestros La lupa mannara begins with full frontal, writhing, moaning dance by shapely blonde Annik Borel, who as Daniella Neseri mistakenly believes she is a werewolf. The hottest part is when the camera catches background fire between her legs. The opening flashback reveals her hairy ancestor was probably a lycanthropic creature. Ms. Borel is, unfortunately, not a werewolf; she is merely a very strong lunatic.As a film, Werewolf Woman in English would have been better if Borels character really was a female werewolf; with her sexual victimization a great bit of characterization. But, as far as 1970s skin and blood flicks go, this one is hard to beat. Bouncy Borel is either nude or sexily clad throughout the film, which features a fair amount of gratuitous gore.

Which actually I found quite interesting. The original Wolf Man was intended to be a completely psychological movie, but Universal threw in the actual Wolf man you were never supposed to see for n extra buck or two. I find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf interesting. Unfortunately this is not the film I was searching for.Instead we know shes not a werewolf from the beginning, so there is no thrill or twist, also they attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario. They fail there too adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality. At first I was excited upon reading the description of the film. But I slowly realized it was a cover just so they could expose the main characters breasts as often as possible.Annik Borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role, or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role. Since the character Danniele has no brains and is just a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a wolf, it takes little skill to play. She has moments were her performance breaks through for a creepy moment but is quickly ruined by the poor camera work and light.

Werewolf Woman of 1976 is a film with a highly promising title, but, sadly, the film itself is pretty far away from being a mustsee for my fellow Italian Horror buffs. You will not hear me say that Rino Di Silvestris film is entirely bad  it has its stylish moments, and the first half is actually great fun to watch though the fun is unintentional. The film also profits from an exceptionally exhibitionist leading actress, Annik Borel. However, the film, which has no real plot at least no linear one often makes no sense at all, and it drags incredibly throughout the mostly superfluous second half.Daniella Annik Borel has strange dreams about a dancing around naked in the night before turning into a Werewolf Woman. Since she was a raped as a girl, Daniella is afraid of men. Then, when her sister cult siren Dagmar Lassander comes to visit with her husband, Daniella suddenly feels attracted to the husband and subsequently turns into a Werewolf Woman herself... or something. The storyline really does not make the slightest sense, which makes the film a lot of fun to watch throughout the first half. The leading character Daniella is some schizophrenic mixture of frigid hysteric and lusty nymphomaniac, who occasionally turns into a werewolf woman. Director Di Silvestri chose to make up for the plotholes with a lot of of female nudity, which works fine for me. There are also some pretty welldone gore moments. The film is never even slightly suspenseful or creepy, but it is very entertaining in the beginning. Also, there are no attempts to hide that this is a slice of sleaze, the camera often does closeups on the Miss Borels private parts for the simple heck of it. I am not complaining. Then, for some reason, Di Silvestri chose to make the film longer by completely changing the direction in which it was going. While Daniella is, at first, a typical werewolf, who cannot help but follow the urges of her curse, this suddenly changes when she meets a guy Howard Ross, who was in Fernando Di Leos Il Boss of 1973. Suddenly, she goes back to normal again, and the subsequent part of the film does not at all go in hand with the first half. It gets pretty damn boring after a while; all things considered, it probably would have been better for this 99 minute film to be only 70 minutes long. At the end, they even want to make us believe that the absurd story if one can call it that is based on true events.

Fun the first few times, but a hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly. Shes not even a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film cannot even decide its tone, with the first ten minutes a flashback being legitimate supernatural horror I thought I was in for a trash classic after these to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller. At the end, the director insists this is based on a true story. Yeah, all right.To be fair, there are a few entertaining aspects of the production. The title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes. However, these become rather monotonous quickly.

If the casting was a bad joke  e.g., Richards as Kramer playing Micawber  which it was, then the direction and acting were the poorly delivered punch lines. Getting beyond Kramer as Micawber, if possible, Ham was such a complete ogre, hunchback and all, that I was half expecting at some point to see him being pursued by an angry pitchfork and torch wielding mob of villagers. Uriah was almost as much of a clown figure as Micawber. Mr. Murdstone evoked about as much terror as that Muppet vampire from Sesame street. The actor playing older David was, I believe, actually a woman. In any case, looking perpetually as if he wished he could find a mirror to see how pretty he looked, and fancied that he looked quite pretty indeed, he could scarcely convince us that he was writing with a quill pen. And while we are on that subject, in one of the many gross inaccuracies perpetrated by the halfwit producers of this embarrassment, in the unnecessary shots of David writing his story he appears to be somewhere between 18 and 21 years old, when he should be in his forties. Perhaps the greatest transgression, although it is difficult to choose, was the invented showdown between David and Murdstone as he courted a third wife in Switzerland, preceded of course by the invented death of Murdstones second wife. While they were at it it is a wonder they did not send Heep to the guillotine, and have him deliver Sidney Cartons famous last words. It could not have made things much worse really.

Too bad they did not have better material to work with.","label":0},{"index":12080,"txt":"Ben Stiller does not so much act as react. And he does it very well. He is very dependent on the comedy going on around him. In There is Something About Mary, the standup hair scene only works because of Stiller trying to keep a straight face. When he confronts Marys other two suitors, he is the unfunniest guy in the room but the scene is hilarious.In Along Came Polly, the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to fathom. Stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, of which there are too few. Having said that, Hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humour  you know we are in trouble when they go to the fart jokes to raise a laugh. A basketball scene where Hoffman hams it up is completely overplayed though it throws up one predicament in the form of a shirtless opponent that does raise a smile  noticeably through Stillers reaction. However, everyone seems to be acting in a bubble, there is very little reaction. Hoffman and Stillers characters could have played off each other much, much more. Aniston again reprises her Rachael role, but Stiller is no Ross. It is more of a Joey with a crush on Rachael scenario.Polly is a bythenumbers romcom and that is its failing  it lacks heart. You do not root for the characters. With a little bit more work we could have had a deeper story, but in the end the films failure comes down to poor writing. Worth watching if it pops up on TV on a slow night, but you will regret forking out cash to see it.","label":0},{"index":12081,"txt":"Considering the potential this move had, the reality was disappointing.

Here it looks like he is just going thru the motions. If they have to lift plot points from Friends, they should have known something was wrong. The toilet humor should have stayed in the closet .Watch 50 First Dates instead.","label":0},{"index":12082,"txt":"This film offers absolutely no imagination in it is premise nor in it is execution but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this socalled comedy that has no energy to speak of. Story is about nitpicky over analytical insurance risk manager Reuben Feffer Ben Stiller who finds his new wife Lisa Debra Messing cheating on him with a scuba instructor Hank Azaria after only one day on their honeymoon. Upon returning home Reuben and his best friend Sandy Philip Seymour Hoffman go to a party and run into Polly Prince Jennifer Aniston whom they went to school with years earlier.SPOILER ALERT Polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives carefree which is the opposite of who Reuben is as a person but they start to date and Reuben starts to change as a person as he starts to try out new things such as salsa dancing and eating spicy foods. But one day Lisa comes back and wants to remain married to Reuben but he really does not want to but Polly decides to leave as she does not believe in marriage to begin with.This film is the second directing effort by John Hamburg who wrote two generally unfunny screenplays in Zoolander and Meet the Parents but those two films seem like classics compared to this stale piece of drivel. It is very easy to say something is not funny but I think with this film it is even easier to figure out why. This film is totally and utterly predictable from start to finish with every scene looking as if it is only happening because of the ridiculousness of the script. Hamburg who also wrote the script seems to have written this without any thought of trying something different and at times he seems to be trying to generate the same energy as There is Something About Mary but instead the events seem incredibly forced. Did anyone really think the blind ferret was funny? If you do, your easy! A few times during the film characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything but all they achieve is overstating the obvious. Stiller works a lot but maybe he should work less and just wait for the better scripts to come his way because this film does not work as a comedy or as a romance.","label":0},{"index":12083,"txt":"Make no bones about it. There are a lot of things wrong with this movie. It is clich\u00e9d the whole way, not very funny, predictable, and illogical. Let us start at the beginning characters. There is the boring, luckless guy  giving Stiller another notch in his boring, luckless guy belt  the allegedly wild, but in reality just fairly normal, love interest  whom Aniston plays well, but really needed no effort to do so  the fat, jovial friend, and then the assortment of clich\u00e9s an annoying daredevil Australian guy, a confident Spanish guy, etc. The storyline the beginning is slightly unusual, but thereafter goes into the standard anymovie style, with every plot turn as predictable as your average knockknock joke. The biggest problem was that Stillers characters development really seemed to come from nothing  like your average school play, the writers knew where he started and where he ended, but did not put enough stock into properly telling the middle bit. Finally, the alleged jokes were nothing but highly watered down versions of standard grossout humour; there was a regulation chunder scene, sweaty fat men, etc.In conclusion, the simple fact about this movie is that learning the meaning of the word shart was the only good thing. Hamburg really dished up a dogs dinner here, and the sugar coating of Stiller and Aniston may have lured the viewers, but the taste left at the end was just as rancid.Final comment This film may have been dreadful, but Aniston still picked a better betweenFriendsseasons movie than Kudrows odious Marci X.","label":0},{"index":12084,"txt":"Okay, I absolutely LOVE Ben Stiller, although I am lukewarm about Jennifer Aniston.

Halfway through the movie I began to realize that Ben Stiller really is not that funny, but he tries VERY hard. And Jennifer Anniston really is not that pretty, but her HAIR looks great.

He undoubtedly has comic talent, but he needs to either find another schtick or take a break, find some material that is actually funny. Because his movies are going from painfully humorless to excruciatingly bad.There is absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is a shame because she is a good, smart actress with a promising career. As long as she keeps making more movies such as The Good Girl in which she is terrific and less like Along Came Polly, she will have a career of which she could be proud.Aniston tries desperately to overcome the limp material with which she is working, but it is a daunting task for any actress. With the exception of a few moments with Alec Baldwin, as Reubens boss Stan, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Reubens best friend Sandy, there is nothing funny in this awful film. Other supporting characters, including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying.

Visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set. The shrill antics of a screeching Taylor, Burtons half asleep wanderings, the loony dialog, Noel Coward laughing at himself, the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer.

With heavyweights Taylor, Burton, Noel Coward, Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey, one might be tempted to think, how bad could it be? Well, it is a lot worse than you could possibly imagine.The sad and disturbing fact of Boom is that is seems to signal the decline and fall of the aforementioned heavyweights. It was only director Joseph Losey who having plummeted the depths with Modesty Blaise and Boom some may wish to add Secret Ceremony, managed to recuperate and in 1970 create his best work, the wonderful GoBetween.Saddest of all is the work of Tennesee Williams. From the mid forties until the early sixties, Williams penned a number of plays which have gained classic status, remaining in theater repertory throughout the world, many becoming much praised films. When Williams muse deserted him, probably owing to his notorious substance abuse, it deserted him for good. Williams at his best is an actors dream providing many unforgettable performances. Were Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr ever better than in Night of the Iguana ?  Taylor in particular, shone in both Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Suddenly Last Summer. There is an anecdote in which supposedly Taylor asks John Gielgud whether he would teach her to play Shakespeare, to which he replied if you will teach me to play Tennessee Williams. Had Gielgud seen Boom he would have held his tongue. Taylor simply has never been worse, turning in a cringe inducing performance. Despite her face photographing well, she is decidedly podgy. Besides the physical decline, from this time onwards she would basically lose credibility as a serious actress with a string of completely forgettable and worse roles to her credit.Much the same could be said of Burton. Following his short lived theatrical stardom, he won fame and fortune in Hollywood. But the body of his work from this point onwards 1968 would be unremarkable to say the least.Noel Coward had long ceased being a force in the theater where his drawing room comedies had been replaced by the likes of Williams and the British angry young men. He seems to be enjoying himself camping it up, but barely manages to amuses, that from the man who claimed such a talent.The only cast member who maintains her dignity is young Joanna Shimkus, who in a few years would forego a promising screen career to become Mrs. Sidney Poitier.Boom reeks of self indulgence; it is simply out of control.

It is the kind of film whose central conflict could be instantly resolved if the characters concerned simply sat down and had a chat. Ajay Devgan plays Arjun, an aspiring popartiste obsessed with performing before a cheering crowd at Londons Wembley Stadium. He becomes jealous of his devoted best friend and bandmate Manu, played by Salman Khan, who is evidently more talented than him, but nowhere near as focused or ambitious. Arjun decides to sabotage Manu when the latters popularity threatens to outshine his own. Now heres where a hearttoheart might have helped. Had Arjun explained what this Wembley fixation meant to him, Manu would have graciously backed off and let Arjun fulfill his childhood dream, and we would have been spared the agony of watching the rest of this uninspiring drivel. But director Vipul Shah and his writers are in no mood to do us any favours. London Dreams is packed with unintentionally hilarious gems like that backstory involving Arjuns grandpa who committed suicide out of shame for getting stagefright at a packed Wembley concert. Or the ridiculous incident at a show where Manu must take over vocal responsibilities after a blast of confetti practically chokes Arjun into silence. The idiocy, however, does not end there. In his attempts to shame Manu publicly, Arjun uses his connections to get Manu hooked onto drugs. A buxom groupie urges Manu to down a couple of tequila shots with her but replaces his salt with cocaine. Before you know it, Manu has acquired quite the appetite for the addictive white powder, practically chomping it down like dinner. If that is not silly enough, there is a crude scene later in which Manu chases after the said girl to find out who she is been taking orders from. The pursuit ends in a dark London alley where the girl gets down on her knees pretending to do the unmentionable so as to mislead Manus girlfriend who is been secretly following after them. Wait, there is more! Expect to howl hysterically when Arjun snaps off his belt and whips himself mercilessly to banish all thoughts of romance or lust towards the bands lead dancer Priya played by Asin because nothing and no one must distract him from his musical goals. Too generously inspired by Milos Formans Amadeus for it to merit any comparison with last years Rock On!, Vipul Shahs latest is a clunky melodrama that is as loosely directed as it is scripted. The film goes for broad humor, overthetop emotions, and basically chooses loudness over subtlety. That works for Manus character, with Salman Khan playing him all loutish and lovable, but in the case of Arjun, Ajay Devgan comes off too passive with a performance that is mostly internalised. When Arjun does reach boiling point however, it results in an awkward preclimax scene in which he lectures a packed concert hall and is understandably pelted with plastic bottles as punishment. Of the remaining cast, there is not a kind word I can say for Asin, who practically lit up Ghajini with her ebullient charm, but disappoints here with unnecessary overacting in a thankless role. Ranvijay Singh and Aditya Roy Kapur, reduced to mere sidekicks in the band, show up at regular intervals, usually to utter some inane dialogue like, We will rock it dude!

Vipul Shah the writer puts Vipul Shah the director down. The first hour is boring, The second hour is better; but again the climax is horrendous. How can anyone forgive a person who decided to destroy you? I will not. Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and ask forgiveness to his diaper buddy, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he reaches India, rather than slapping or abusing him Salman welcomes him with band baja and says he was the reason behind the entire fiasco? Was Vipul Shahs intension to show Salmans character as a GOD? If yes, than you have failed completely. The only question I want to ask Vipul Shah is that, would you welcome a person who destroyed you with such a great reception? Write what you feel, do not fool us {the audience}, we are sensible enough to understand what is good or not. This is a musical but the music by ShankarEshaanLoy is terrible. Not a single song stays in your mind. Salman is superb though. He carries the film on his shoulders and does really, really well in the emotional scenes. But again his character is shown as a GOD, which makes him look like a retard in the end. Ajay is equally good, but Salman has overshadowed him completely. Asin is wasted, and what is a great talent like Om Puri doing in this film? Rannvijay hams, though Aditya Roy Kapoor excels. Brinda Parekh is alright as the vamp.On the whole, this dream remains a dream!","label":0},{"index":12108,"txt":"Who were they kidding with this? There was just too much in this film that was hard to digest. Right from when Arjun Ajay Devgan unknowingly wishes death on his father to when he arrives in London with his uncleplayed by Om Puri only to abandon him minutes later. The only problem with that theory is that anybody who has ever passed through London Heathrow knows that such a f\u00eate would be impossible to pull off and especially not by an Indian. But the film problems do not end there, there is the issue of the two main leads Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan passing as rockstars on the verge of achieving their dreams. I mean yeah we saw success come to Susan Boyle a woman in the UK achieving her dreams after age 50 but that was a rare case. It was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief because I felt that the casting of Salman and Ajay was just illconceived. They would never cast Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi to play the same roles so why should we be forced to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan men well into their 40s prance around desperately trying to hang on to their 20s? Let us not even talk about the most selfconscious actress on screen today, Asin. This is her second film that I have seen and she is just hopeless as an actress, so conscious of her looks that she only concerns herself with looking good and voguing for the camera rather than giving in a good acting performance. It is just hard to believe that she turned down all those other movie roles to star in this fluff and then be so fluffy as an actress, nothing to write home about at all. And to top all of that, the film just boringly dragged on.

Salman Khans over the top acting or faking is too painful to watch. I remember seeing some good movies from this Producer Vipul Shah but this is not one of them.

Well, he did not, they were just sitting and waiting for something to happen.

The father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his exwife knows about it and finds it alright. It would be OK, if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body, but they did not, they only deprived him of memories. The actors were good, they were really funny. Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr. was very funny in the dancing scene  ... But some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years it is a long time!, she was true to him, she loved nobody but him, and when she met him and was just about making love to him, after a scene with her friend Philip Train Ryan ONeal, she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years!!!

Unfortunately this is not it.It should have been a good movie about WWI. Even though it was made for television it is obvious that a real effort was made to use appropriate equipment and props. But the writing and directing are badly lacking, even though the makers of this movie obviously borrowed freely from quite a few well made war movies. War movie clich\u00e9s abound such as the arrogant general who apparently does not care a flip about the lives of his men. When will Hollywood realize that, even though there have been plenty of bad generals, most combat unit generals have seen plenty of combat themselves and are not naive about what the average grunt experiences? The first part of this movie appeared to be Paths of Glory with American uniforms. Except that Paths of Glory was emotionally gripping. Later on there was Chamberlains charge except uphill from Gettysburg and even the capture of the American soldier by a ring of enemy soldiers from The Thin Red Line. But in The Thin Red Line the soldier was alone when captured. In this movie a ring forms around the new prisoner in the middle of a battle.If this movie used a military adviser they ignored him. Even though the actors and I never could forget they were actors while watching mouthed military tactics I did not see very much of it. The American soldiers would stand up to be shot while the Germans attacked. And the infamous Storm Troopers, who were apparently blind, appeared to use no tactics whatsoever in their attack. In the real war, the tactics were what made storm troopers so effective. But the silliest scene was the attack of the German Flamethrowers. In this scene the German flamethrower operators walked in a broad line towards the defending Americans. If that had been real they would never have gotten close enough to use their flamethrowers before they had all been dropped by the defenders bullets.Okay, so most war movies are unrealistic when it comes to the tactics shown. But it is still disappointing. But what really turned me off to this flick was the typical antiwar antimilitary angle that movie makers seem to think is important. True, war is hell. But most American soldiers, even though they grumble and gripe, tend to believe in what they are doing and can be rather gungho about it. My Grandfather served in World War I.

This is not good considering that they are the leads, and it especially is not good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors. It is a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot is not not completely. It follows a young girl who, after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook, wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created. It soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings, and so sets about making various changes, until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare.

First and foremost, in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness; the movie is extremely stale. The central plot is hardly played with at all, and the result is an entirely boring experience. The lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie, as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just do not care any more which is due to a lack of ideas. Thanks in part to it is lead characters, the film feels like a kids movie throughout. This is to be expected as it stars kids, but Bernard Rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story; as the horror in the movie is laughable at best. The film is also very cheesy, and the romance between the two leads is extremely cringeworthy, and makes for very painful viewing.

Add to this directed propaganda the fact that filmmaker Hippler was preaching to the converted, not so much asking gentile Europeans to hate the Jews as validating the feelings so many of them must have held already, in order to have allowed the holocaust that followed. The weakest link in the films logic shows in its rat analogy, wherein it goes on to explain the behavior of rats, and then adds something to the effect of Well, Jewish people are like that too. Similarly it characterizes Jewish people as ugly by showing ugly Jewish people in comparison to attractive gentiles; the accompanying leap of faith is that ugly is bad. The film appears to contradict itself a few times, for example by attacking Western painters who portrayed Old Testament characters as lightskinned Europeans; thereby the text admits that socalled Hebrew ethnicity is in fact an ingrained aspect of Christian culture. It also shows ghetto Jews willingly living in roachinfested filth, despite the supposed treasure they have hoarded, and then flipflops by saying that these same undesirables live in wealth and luxury as soon as they leave the ghetto. Incidentally, who would not? The use of scenes from a wellknown American film, House of Rothschild, shows an equally blurry deployment of logic. First the film is denounced as having been made by Jews; then it is apparently used by Hippler to verify the deceptiveness of Jews the aforementioned pretense of poverty by ghetto Jews, shown as a means of avoiding taxation, although the Rothschild characters spin is that Jews are taxed excessively; finally the Rothschild film is once again execrated for implying that the famed banking family invented the checking account. This apparent indecisiveness in whether the American footage is shown positively or negatively might become clearer with repeated viewings, but at first sight it makes for some murky moviewatching. For all of Eternal Jews imperfections, I was at first surprised that the IMDb viewer rating for this film is as high as it is, just shy of a 5 to date. I would say the reason is that EJs documentary value has exceeded its original purpose, offering us, unintentionally, a look into the lives of European Jews as they would not be seen a few years hence. Needless to say the films very badness also provides an historical insight into bad, or simply evil, filmmaking as a propagandists tool. About this time I should expect director Hippler to flipflop once again, springing forward to say That is what I meant to do all along!

Anyway, I feel that I have a bit of a problem here as I have read plenty of positive comments about La Chute de la Maison Usher  maybe I am not the right sort of person to write a comment on it but I have to say that it simply did not do anything for me. I did not like it, obviously the first thing to say is that this is a silent film  therefore it relies on imagery but even so I thought the story was weak, I thought as a whole the film was boring  dull even though it only lasts for about an hour  it really did not do anything for me at all. La Chute de la Maison Usher was made almost 80 years ago  that is literally a lifetime, the world, cinema  tastes have moved on a lot since then  I found no enjoyment in this film. I feel this film has dated badly  probably was not that good to start with anyway. I never felt for any of the characters, I never cared about anything that was happening  I found it all rather tedious to sit through, I am sorry if I have offended any silent film fans out there but that is the way I felt.Director Epstein does an OK job, a lot of people ramble on about the imagery in La Chute de la Maison Usher  I will freely admit it definitely has it is moments but I thought they were few  far between. Shots of peoples mouths moving  not actually hearing what they say just seemed weird to me, I did not like the music  the version I saw kept the original French language insert cards which were narrated by guy with the most awful sounding thick French accent which was also off putting. Based on the story by Edgar Allen Poe I doubt this has much resemblance to it apart from one or two basic elements, stick with the fantastic Roger Corman House of Usher starring Vincent Price.Technically the film was OK considering when it was made. You simply cannot tell about the acting as no one ever speaks although the film is full of unnatural exaggerated movements to try  suggest emotions or reflect what is happening which works to an extent but after a while just looks a bit daft.La Chute de la Maison Usher will appeal to those who crave a bygone era, who live in caves or who are stuck in the past, for me I like my films to have a story, not to bore me  to have sound  I am sorry if that last statement makes me sound like an uneducated idiot but that is how I feel. The world has moved on since 1928  for the better.","label":0},{"index":12138,"txt":"Movies have put me to sleep before, but no movie has ever done that twice, so it took me three sittings actually to finish it.

The first art film I managed to get a hold of was Peter Greenaways The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, which blew my mind and creative spiret into overdrive. The film was the ultimate paradox, both beautiful and grotesque...this is what art cinema was about, exploring intellectual ideas and bringing the visceral to the screen with purpose. Life, real life, can be like living in a madhouse, and art expressed shows it for what it is. I love movies of all types, but especially those that both entertain and have something to say, whether I agree with it is stance or no...8 12 WOMEN, is a dry, clinical comedy where a father and son gather a harem to fufill their many sexual fantasies. There is only a very brief allusion to Fellini in the film, unlike what the previews have suggested. The main focus of the film falls on the close relationship between father and son, brought together after the mothers death. In the early scenes of the film the fathers sadness is believable, you can feel his pain. What happens afterwards is plain by Greenaway standards, the gathering of the harem, observations on love and death, and flesh displayed for the sake of flesh...One could argue this, but I feel the movie to be shallow and pointless. And the idea that this could be a comedy is perplexing to me. The acting for the most part if fine,...especially good are Polly Walker and Amanda Plummerthough poor Mandy should put her clothes back on What the film lacks is a compelling story, and the usual Greenaway touches of excess that made his other films so wonderful to watch. While filled with moments of insight, and the occasional taboo, 8 12 Women is too cut and paste to be considered art, too bland to considered funny, and simply too dull to be considered worthwhile.Save your money...I can only recommend this film as a sleeping aid.4 out of 10","label":0},{"index":12149,"txt":"WriterDirector Peter Greenaway cements his title as the High Lord of Art House Pretension with his latest exercise in obnoxious selfindulgence, 8 \u00bd Women.

There is the Kabukiobsessed Mio, the everpregnant Giaconda and Beryl, who is got a thing for farm animals. Giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair, she is the half woman, get it?

The beauty in sexual relations between men and women is shown degraded by a set of men and women who can only be described as a collection of oddballs and misfits.Greenaway acknowledges his inspiration to Fellinis film 8 12 but whereas Fellini is a titan of world cinema, Greenaway is not.He has none of the maestros lightness of touch nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with a deftness of clarity.He is pretentious, the film being divided into chapters with a written introduction to each, as if the viewer has to be guided into the film except that the written notices only stay on screen for a few seconds, not long enough to be read by the audience with the result that they are mostly ignored.As for the women, only two can be described as lookers, Palmira, played by Polly Walker and Giaconda played by Natacha Amal. The rest ooze with ordinariness. Both the women and the men retreat from the harsh light of reality into the dim shades of fantasy.Greenaway obviously wants to make the point that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness. The women themselves are depressing since they render their services in exchange for money. Relations between men and women are debased into a commercial transaction.There is no sense of joy or happiness or love in the film, indeed there are several scenes that are deeply unpleasant The suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son, Philip and Storey Emmental played respectively by John Standing and Matthew Delamere. The callous disregard of both men that Giaconda is carrying their child, she in fact, gets pregnant twice, the first foetus being aborted and the second time, she is sent away to a destination chosen by the men from a flight book. Both men having sex with a woman who has no legs, the half woman in the title. The beastiality that exists between Beryl, played by Amanda Plummer, with a pig named Hortense. Father and son sharing women between them. Women enjoying being beaten sexually. The father sleeping with the corpse of his dead wife.Mercifully, none of these scenes are shown sexually, only hinted at.The hinted degradation of women is such that there cannot be any wonder that the film was booed at when it was first premiered at Cannes. What is more extraordinary is that the actresses in the film lined up to defend it, showing yet again that there is no limit to the naivety of women and that women will fool themselves into being exploited by men.Greenaways directorial style is pretentious, it is a triumph of style over substance, a depiction of Film as Art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense.Greenaway tries to attain the sublimity of surrealism but only succeeds in showing the banality of human relationships.","label":0},{"index":12151,"txt":"Greenaways films pose as clever, erudite and innovative.

Perhaps like that other innovator, TS Eliot, he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could.Yet Greenaways biggest failing is that he cannot write. His dialog and even plot structure is mechanical and logical but without the vitality of another dramatic logician, Brecht. Where this weakness is most apparent is in his humor, which is poised and logical, so the joke is dead before it is delivered. The result is tedium if it is not funny, it has failed ask a standup comedian to justify their act if the audience does not respond. Perhaps the wellread director could learn something from Freud on humor.Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones.

Like all her films, Bonjour tristesse suffers not at all from her looks though she is perhaps the first of those modern women whom Tom Wolfe gleefully, accurately describes as boys with breasts publicists, of course, use the word gamine but suffers grievously from Sebergs dull, monotonous, killing voice. In all her films when had to play anger, Seberg played it with grossly audible, distracting, gasping panting between her monotonously droned verbalizations. Oy.Premingers adaptation of Fran\u00e7oise Sagans breathlessly juvenile, fantasy soap opera plot is noteworthy only for his lush cinematography  but then that is difficult to funk on the photogenic French Riviera, and perhaps for his apt, but certainly not groundbreaking, employment of black  white for the present day scenes from which Sebergs monotone narration delivers us to the flashedbackto color past.Juliette Gr\u00e9co has a brief moment, as a nightclub chanteuse in the black  white spotlight, delivering in smoky Dietrichesque voice the bleak existentialist lyric of the title song. This moment is nowadays, in retrospect, more than a wee bit dr\u00f4le. Except, of course, if you are French  particularly if you are a French 68er longing for the glorious days of the barricades roundabout the Sorbonne  and your kids riot to retain the lifelong sinecures which have blighted and emasculated Frances economy then you still believe in Sartre and Foucault and all such arcane, irrelevant theorists.David Niven has the hardest role, having to play with sufficient gusto an aging hedonist who is yet to grasp that life is not all about Sagans teenybopper notions of a hip, cool, swingin, mon copain! Papa. Deborah Kerr delivers her usual, consummately professional presence, convincingly playing the woman who suffers undeservedly Sebergs spiteful teenaged snotnose jealousy fulfilling Sagans shallow teen fantasy of the Classical theme of there can be only one Queen Bee in the hive; in fact, to Kerr belongs this films sole great and memorable onscreen moment.The dialogue is unnatural  I agree with an earlier reviewer who said that it sounds to be badly translated from French; combine the unnatural scripting with Sebergs incomparably dull, unendurable monotone and you can save that Valium for another night. Atop all that the ineptly synched postproduction voice dubbing is, almost throughout, obvious and thus much more than irksome this is especially true of the dubbing for Myl\u00e8ne Demongeot because it spoils her otherwise very pleasing dumb blonde performance.Hunky Geoffrey Horne gets the short end of the stick here  a very good looking young man who also suffered from a lessthanlovely, uncinematic voice which, when paired with Sebergs drone, yields unconvincing scenes of puppy love. Horne was, shall we say, merely adequate in Bridge On the River Kwai, perhaps because his end was held up by those great cinema pros William Holden and Jack Hawkins instead of being unsupported by the regrettably ungifted Seberg.In sum Bonjour tristesse is pretty to look at but it is shallow, immature soap thin gruel with suds.","label":0},{"index":12155,"txt":"This is shallow hedonism andor social commentary wrapped in a tragic tale about a jealous young womans scheme to drive apart her father and his fianc\u00e9e.

Seberg is poor I agree with the boys with breasts comment of an earlier review. The plot plodded. This predictable material was sufficient for about 30 minutes of film that unfortunately was stretched over an hour and a half! If you want to see great gowns and jewels on the Riviera, I recommend To Catch a Thief  in which you will get the added bonuses of an entertaining story and likable characters.

This portrays irritating, rich idiots as in Last Year at Marienbad, but this time it is a travelogue.In this Preminger movie sequences develop, but characters do not. For the first 30 minutes he is content to blur the fatherdaughter relationship between Seberg and Niven, making uncomfortable sexual readings possible.

He spends so much time normalizing orthodox British behavior in all his movies, he never gets around to the character.In the most memorable sequence, an evening out dancing becomes a freeforall in a harbor. Bertolucci steals the entire scene for his empty exercise, The Conformist.

She is beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that she can strike poses but she cannot act. Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in Otto Premingers St. Joan  Sebergs first film  knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film. This movie, also by Preminger, fulfills the promise of the first. It was her second movie; she was now 20. What was Preminger thinking? That Niven and Kerr could compensate for Sebergs lack of acting capacity? Not a chance? Sebergs character is at the center of the story and, pretty though she is, convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old, she cannot meet the emotional demands of the role. I do not know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures.

That is fine with Seberg, as long as Niven loves her and leaves her as he is done with all the women in his past...including Demongeot. When it appears as though she is becoming second banana in Nivens life, Seberg exact revenge on Kerr. Preminger tells the story in flashbacks from Sebergs perspective and cleverly combines black and white with sunnier color scenes. The cinematography by Georges P\u00e9rinal is stunning. The film features some of Premingers least heavyhanded direction, although he rarely allows any closeups, which makes it difficult to make out what the actors are really feeling. Arthur Laurents wrote the script and it is full of acidic dialog and funny scenes mostly involving birdbrained Demongeot. Seberg acquits herself fairly well, but Niven is at his least appealing...and he shows no chemistry with either Seberg or Kerr. Preminger really missteps with that casting. It is a role that seems tailor made for someone closer to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as Sebergs wouldbe suitor and Martita Hunt as his daffy mother.

Overt references to the genre are peppered throughout, from stock characters the authority figure who does not believe the monstrous invasion is really happening to Kevin Smith style discussions to reenacting Duane Jones last moments from Night of the Living Dead not once but twice.Unfortunately it takes more than love to make a good movie.The staging and shot choice are unexciting and unimaginative. While a common admonition in film school is to avoid Mastershot Theatre, telling the story completely in a wide master shot, here we find the obverse as in several sequences it is hard to figure out the spatial relationships between characters as the story is told in a series of medium shots with no establishing shot to tie it together. Editing is drab and basic and at times there are unmotivated cuts. The lighting is flat and sometimes muddy, making the scenes in the darkened theatre hard to make out was there lighting, or was this shot with available light only?. Some shots are out of focus. The dialogue is trite, and the performances, for the most part, onenote Isaiah Robinson shows some energy and screen presence as Curtis, and the fellow playing the projectionist has some pleasantly dickish line readings; Michael Allen Williams as the theater manager and Casey Kirkpatrick as enthusiastic film geek Eric have some nice moments. The premise is silly, even for a B horror flick Also, it is too bad Dr Eisner was unaware of Project Paperclip  he could have saved himself a lot of trouble!. The zombies are nonthreatening, and their makeup is unconvincing although the chunky zombie trying to get a gumball out of the machine raised a smile. For a zombie fan film, there is very little blood or violence, although what there is, is handled pretty well. The incidental music, while stylistically uneven, is kind of nice at times, and there are some good foley effects. The Time Warp parody was a fun listen, although the images going along with it were less fun to watch. Unfortunately, the looped dialogue sounds flat. Was this shot nonsync doubtful, it looks like video through and through? I watched the special introduction by Troma Films Lloyd Kaufman before the main feature  although it consisted essentially of Kaufman plugging his own stuff and admitting that he had not seen the movie while someone mugged in a Toxie mask, its production and entertainment values were higher than Dead... itself quick aside to whoever put the DVD together  the countdown on film leader beeps only on the flashframe 2, not on every number plus one more after. For that matter, the vampire film theatregoers are seen watching early in Dead... looked a lot more entertaining than this.

This is simply not true. Prior to the construction of Interstate 64, which bypasses the Ocean View area, the primary route for traffic went through the heart of Ocean View. Once the interstate was completed, Ocean View rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime. This led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park, which also faced new competition from nearby Busch Gardens in Williamsburg. Meanwhile, in the past few years, the City of Norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a soughtafter location for construction of highend housing.It has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film Rollercoaster. This is also untrue. Footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film, but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to Death of Ocean View Park.As to the film itself, the storyline of a supernatural force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly, but somewhat typical for Bgrade movies of the time. With the cast involved, there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors. I do not believe this film was intended to be another Citizen Kane; I believe Playboy was experimenting with a new nonnude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into apparently not!. A strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table, but proved unmanageable in execution. The roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway; let us come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise!.For the casual movie viewer, this would be a see once and forget about it film except for Diana Canova fans; but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park, this movie is like a walk down memory lane for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown Norfolk, the first Harborfest, and Old Dominion University.

She spots a woman Elizabeth McGovern being attacked outside but she cannot call the cops because it would blow her marriage to Gutenbergs boss Paul Shenar. So Guttenberg, honest citizen that he is, when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed nearby only half an hour later, comes forward and claims to have witnessed the first attack, merely intending to pass on the information given to him by Huppert. Well  never bear false witness against thy neighbor, as they say.This simple attempt to help the police nab a murderer turns rapidly twisted. When he meets the first nearvictim, McGovern, she immediately twigs to what happened, but agrees to keep quiet for the moment. But then Guttenberg finds himself in court, supposed to identify the heavy Greenquist and we discover through crossexamination that he is NEARSIGHTED and cannot identify objects at a distance, let alone faces. Not that it matters because, after all, he never saw the creep in the first place. The plot gets practically labyrinthine. Guttenberg winds up the chief suspect when Huppert is murdered too.He barely escapes arrest and holes up with the nowsympathetic McGovern. Guttenberg and McGovern hatch a plan to trap the murderer. She will serve as bait. They will follow the flagitious creep into one of his seedy haunt and McGovern will act like the doxy that the murderer is attracted to, just to get him to try to kill her. But everything will be okay, see, because not only will Guttenberg keep a close watch on her, and not only will he alert the police a few minutes after she enters this dive, but she will keep a can of mace handy  just in case.I ask you, the alert viewer, does this scenario unfold as planned? Elizabeth McGovern has a quirkily interesting bone structure. She seems all mandible and tiny mouth at times, but she is vibrant. Steve Guttenberg has hair on his brawn and that is about it. Otherwise he is as helpless as the character he plays. If Isabelle Huppert can act, it is not evident in this film. The killer is so formed and so groomed that he looks like he is wearing one of those masks of deformity in that Twilight Zone episode about greedy heirs.Did not the director, Curtis Hanson, go on to make L.A. Confidential? That was a nicely done piece of work. Here, everything seems clumsy and contrived, down to the small bit parts. Just before the inevitable violent climax, a uniformed police officer is introduced to delay McGoverns rescue, and the scene is embarrassing to watch. Dick Olsen has a bit part as a late shopper. He is a neat guy and always reliable. Paul Shenar as the cuckolded hubby has a striking face that seems made for the stage and he does a fine job too.That louche joint where McGovern attracts the attention of the murderer, where she plays pool with a couple of hairy apes, was shot at a bar in Carolina Beach, in North Carolina, not far from where I lived. The way the interior is set up, it is clear that this is supposed to be a dangerous and dirty dive.

He tries to find out why.The people completely on fire are well done, but when they get to the point that they are well done in another sense, they are obviously changed to dummies. When jets of fire shoot out of characters arms, it looks silly rather than alarming the way it should. Also ridiculous is fire that evidently travels through phone lines and erupts in huge jets from the receivers earpiece. How is that supposed to happen, exactly?Something else that struck me as silly about the movie is when a character has visions of his late parents. We later see the exact same shots from those visions in home movies.","label":0},{"index":12203,"txt":"A man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 50s and that he now has the power to... burst into flames!

It would seem that Hooper wanted to make his own version of films such as Scanners and Firestarter in 1990 and so we end up with Spontaneous Combustion; a film with a couple of good ideas and a whole load more that are borrowed from other films. Put it all together and you get a messy, boring film that most people would do well to miss! The film leads the audience to believe that it might be half decent initially with an intriguing back story that focuses on some experiments carried out on two young people in the fifties. The couple have a child and shortly thereafter burn to death as a result of the experiments done on them. Fast forward some years and the baby is now an adult named Sam; but naturally he is not a normal person and soon finds when it is discovered that he has the ability to set things on fire at will.The film stars Brad Dourif, who must have seemed like a good casting choice given his success with Childs Play two years earlier; but actually was an uninspired decision as the central performance is really terrible; and not helped by the terrible supporting performances. The turgid direction and dull script also do not do the film many favours and the trend of lacking in favours is continued by the special effects, which are very unrealistic and have nothing on the films that this one is ripping off; all of which were made some years earlier. The plot is really slow and it is almost an hour before anything of note happens, and I did not care for it even then. It soon becomes obvious which direction the film will go in and it all boils down to the sort of tedious ending you would expect. The final confrontation is a big disappointment and nothing is really explained during the film. Not that any revelation would have been interesting anyway. Overall, this is a rubbish film and another reason why Tobe Hooper is a long way from being a great horror director.

This ability stems from parents who partook in atomic experiments in the 50s. They die of Spontaneous Human Combustion and it seems that what Sam is beginning to suffer from derives by these pills his girlfriend, LisaCynthia Baingives him to take for rough migraines. In actuality, Lisa was told to manipulate Sam into taking the pills by Lew OrlanderWilliam Prince, pretty much the young mans father who raised him from a child. Lew has benevolent plans..he sees Sam as the first Atomic Man, a pure killing machine in human form. Sam never wanted this and will do whatever it takes to silence those responsible for his condition. As the film goes, Sams blood is slowly growing toxic, green in color instead of red. It seems that water and other substances which often put out fire react right the opposite when Sams uncontrollable outbursts of flame ignite. Come to find out, Lisa has Sams condition whose parents also dies from SHC. Dr. MarshJon Cypher, someone who Sam has known for quite some time as his physician, is to insert toxic green fluid into their bodies, I am guessing to increase their levels of flame.

And, RachelDey Youngis Sams exwife who may be working against her former husband with Lew and Marsh to harm him and Lisa.Quite a strange little horror flick, filled with some pretty awful flameeffects. Dourif tries to bring a tragic element and intensity to his character whose plight we continue to watch as his body slowly becomes toxic waste with fire often igniting from his orifices. There is this large hole in his arm that spits out flame like a volcano and a massive burn spot on his hand which increases in size over time. Best scene is probably when director John Landis, who portrays a rude electrical engineer trying to inform Sam to hang up because the radio program he is calling has sounded off for the night, becomes a victim of SHC. The flick never quite works because it is so wildly uneven with an abrupt, ridiculous finale where Sam offers to free Lisa of her fire by taking it from her.","label":0},{"index":12207,"txt":"Not as bad, as it is credited to being Hoopers done far worse\u0085 more so disappointing for me.

Because of that, the pacing goes on to be rather sluggish and Brad Dourif cool to see him in a leading role seems to struggle with an offbalanced performance, despite etching out a bemusedly quirky intensity to his offcolour character. Even though it is cheaply done, there is a competent technical attitude to it. However it does not seem to go anywhere out of the ordinary with its idea and wants to plaster in nasty jolts which some do work and strikingly steaming special effects flames, flames everywhere instead. Hooper does display some stylishly frenetic imagery more so towards the latter end, and the camerawork is swiftly manoeuvred and the beaming score is titillating.

Because this one just is not all that good.Haliday caught a lot of good natured ribbing from the MST3K crew for his part in this movie and in Devil Doll, but he is actually the best thing in TPM. Maybe he cannot carry the movie, but he gets practically no help here from the screenplay. The script bogs down any forward momentum the plot may have in a mire of nonsense about funding and university politics and a guy named Lembach and some sinister cabal who want the teleportation machine to fail so they can steal its secrets...or something. So all the dramatic sequences in the first half of movie involve either phone calls or unconvincing special effects with transparent espresso machines and teleporting rats. Then when poor Haliday gets mutilated by his machine, he has to spend the last part of the film wearing a diaper over half his face and rubber cement over the rest while he electrocutes various Londoners who chance across his path. Tom Cruise and Eric Roberts using bullhorns could not have made this screenplay work. Meanwhile all the other actors diligently try to inject life and interest into their roles for this turgid little project, but the screenplay just swallows their efforts whole. The corrupt project administrator frets and fumes and hisses into the phone to his blackmailers, all the while failing to notice that he looks like a werewolf outfitted in a tweed suit and a Tattersall vest. Halidays research assistant and exgirlfriend have the least convincing romance in the history of British horror cinema. His secretary is forced to parade around in her smalls.

A big issue I have is with Bryant Haliday in the lead. He is such a horses ass that, not only do I not care about his suffering, I actually root for it.

Therefore, 4 out of 10.","label":0},{"index":12228,"txt":"Not the greatest film to remember Paul Naschy by.Gaston Guillermo Bredeston is probably the worst swordsman I have ever seen. Zorro would be ashamed! His only salvation came as the competition was just as bad.This film is described as adventure and horror. Forget the horror  there is none. No nudity, no blood, no monsters; just a Robin Hood adventure against an evil Baron Paul Naschy who wants to be King.The main feature of the film was seeing Graciela Nilson, who only made four films in two years and disappeared to our regrettable loss. Where did she go?","label":0},{"index":12229,"txt":"I tend to love everything the great late Paul Naschy R.I.P. ever was in. While not all films starring Naschy are great, they all have a specific charm that can be found nowhere but in Naschyflicks, and they are always entertaining. There is no rule without exception, however, as El Mariscal Del Infierno aka. The Devils Possessed 1974 proves. While the film does have the specific Naschyflickcharm, it sadly drags far too much and gets really, really dull inbetween. Naschy stars as the evil Baron Gilles De Lancr\u00e9, who oppresses the people and uses black magic and bloody rituals to stay in power. When Gaston de Malebranche Guillermo Bredeston, who fought side by side with Gilles De Lancr\u00e9 against the British, learns about the Barons evil behavior, he decides to turn against his former comrade in arms and help the people free themselves from the satanic Barons tyranny...Directed by Le\u00f3n Klimovsky, who is best known for directing Naschy in La Noche De Walpurgis The Werewolf Vs. The Vampire Woman, 1971, the film was scripted by Naschy himself. Naschy often scripted his own films, and one must say that he mostly did a better, more original job than it is the case here. El Mariscal Del Infierno is mostly built up as a historical adventure rather than a Horror film, and it gets quite boring throughout the middle. It often resembles the Sword and Sandal films from the 50s, only that this film is set in medieval times. The Satanic part was probably only added because the great Paul Naschys name is linked to the Horror genre. The film has its good parts Paul Naschy giving weird speeches, Paul Naschy looking weird, Paul Naschy doing Satanic stuff, Paul Naschy torturing innocent victims, etc. But sadly, most of the film concentrates on the boring hero and the good guys, and these moments are boring. The female cast members are nice to look at, but, unlike most Naschy films, this one features no nudity and sleaze. There is some gore, but it mostly looks clumsy and is not as fun too look at as it is the case with most other Naschy films. Overall, El Mariscal Del Infierno is only worth a look for my fellow Naschyenthusiasts. There are dozens of films starring the Spanish Horror deity which should be seen before this one, such as El Jorobado De La Morgue The Hunchback of the Morgue, 1973, La Orgia De Los Muertos The Hanging Woman, 1973, El Espanto Surge De La Tumba Horror Rises From The Tomb, 1973, Latidos De Panico Panic Beats, 1983, Rojo Sangre 2004, or any of the Waldemar Daninsky werewolf films.

We hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression, yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand restrictions are in place, but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace.I came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence, so to speak. She continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bombers parents, and her angry and closedminded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control. It is more realistic, in my mind, to see the Israeli mindset to be a root of the problem; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land.I have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother, which normally would be admirable in a documentary, however in the light of the lack of impartiality, it all seems exploitative. Also for the poor edits, lack of background in the actual instance, and finally the lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side. Ultimately, it is a poor documentary and a poor film. I acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation, but am obliged to note the flaws in direction regardless of the heartwrenching and sad subject matter.","label":0},{"index":12231,"txt":"I saw this directors Woman On The Beach and could not understand the good to great reviews.

The Palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of a life of privation and despair. With such completely different viewpoints, any meeting had no real chance of any meeting of the minds. The word peace did not have the same meaning to each of them.

Neatly glossed over is the fact that Ayat had herself just witnessed the death of a close friend at the hands of the Israelisjust outside her home. Gosh,so why on earth would a young, pretty, intelligent girl with plans for college go and do such a thing? Could it be that the hormonal, emotional teenager was traumatized by seeing seeing someone she loved die before her very eyes? This detail merits all of 5 seconds in the movie. Another neatly sidestepped detail is that Avigail Levy, Rachels mother, could have prevented the destruction of the building the Akhras family lived inalong with 22 other families. One distinctly gets the impression that she is offering this as a concession  should Mrs. Akhras agree to speak with her.why should I? she says.since the movie was made the home has been destroyed apparently the interview did not result in what she wanted so bring on the bulldozersMrs Levy claimed that she wanted the movie to be cathartic as well as a symbol of hope, a chance to transcend entrenched hatreds instead she uses it as an excuse to harangue Ayats mother, while dangling the house as a carrot.Moreover although the two women live only 4 miles apart, she is so out of touch with the realities of the occupation for her Palestinian neighbors, that she really thinks that Mrs. Akhras can just drop over for a cup of coffee?Please.And she forgoes the one chance she had to meet Mrs. Akhras in person and see what kind of life she lives.the Akras family originally came from Jaffa, but now live crammed into a refugee camp only 4 miles from where the Levys live in comparative luxury.Any sympathy I would have had for the obviously well to do Mrs. Levy is dissolved by her air of selfrighteous bitchiness.By contrast, Ayats mother comes off as kind,forthright and loving in spite of the best efforts by the post production crew to paint her and her family as monsters. Heck even the music and sound design was one sided I guess the muezzin sings ALL day every day 4 miles from the Levy family home, always in a sharply contrasting key from the sappy newage music that scores this drab excuse for a documentary.Also there is the small matter of translations  Mrs. Levy DIRECTLY addresses the camera in English when she has something worked out to say ahead of time, Hebrew when she does not. Mrs.Akhras spoke only Arabic which received sometimes a TRANSLATION, sometimes TRANSLITERATION, always awkward, and very suspect for a supposedly objective movie.They also sweated her under the lights, while Mrs. Levy sat in air conditioned comfort.Rotten editing for Mrs. Akhras segments too.

Neither one of those films even got close to the success of MASH.What is wrong with Gas!? What is not? No one comes close to really acting at a level above junior high school theatrics. The production values stink. Someone else here mentioned the magically regenerating headlights on a getaway car, and there is more of that lack of attention to detail. Nothing works the way it is supposed to in this film, and nobody cares.Gas! actually put me to sleep. It is not a sure cure for insomnia, but really close. On the Cinematic Sleep Induction scale, Gas! falls somewhere between Last Year at Marienbad and George Clooneys remake of Solaris which itself was remarkable for being more boring than the Mosfilm original, despite that studios seeming unfamiliarity with the idea of keeping the audiences attention by judicious editing.Judicious editing would have decimated Gas! to about twenty minutes.

He was singlehandedly responsible for some of my favorite horror films ever like the Edgar Allen Poe adaptations Masque of the Red Death and Pit and the Pendulum as well as some insufferably cheap and tacky rubbish quickies like Creature from the Haunted Sea and She Gods of the Shark Reef. Corman also made a couple of movies that are simply unclassifiable and \u0096 simply put \u0096 nearly impossible to judge properly. The Trip, for example, as well as this imaginatively titled Gassss can somewhat be labeled as psychedelic exploitation. In other words, they are incredibly strange hippieculture influenced movies. Half of the time you have not got the slightest idea what is going on, who these characters are that walk back and forth through the screen and where the hell this whole thing is going. The plot is simply and yet highly effective a strange but deadly nerve gas is accidentally unleashed and promptly annihilates that the entire world population over the age of 25. This could be the basic premise of an atmospheric, gritty and nailbitingly suspenseful postapocalyptic SciFi landmark, but writer George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to turn it into a trippy roadmovie comedy. None of the characters is even trying to prevent their inevitable upcoming deaths; they just party out in the streets and found little juvenile crime syndicates. Gassss is a disappointingly boring and tries overly hard to be bizarre. The entire script appears to be improvised at the spot and not at all funny.

It is as if the producers of LaughIn sat down and decided to write a full length film, covering all the high points and more of the issues between the flower children and the establishment, then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a 10,000 budget to complete it. Hardly a classic, but in its own way it does capture how truly strange that time was, the silliness, the overidealism, and the uptightness of the establishment. Clearly not for everyone.","label":0},{"index":12240,"txt":"When I first popped in Happy Birthday to Me, I checked the timer to see how long the film was. I was amazed at the length. Both animated and horror films share a common ground attention span of the selected audience and that should be at or right around 90 minutes. Anything more, and you will lose the bulk of your audience.This 110 minutes, or 20 minutes past its prime was a huge problem for me. I would like to say half of this movie could have been edited out, but I would be too generous to say that. Go ahead and watch it and tell me how many scenes could have been edited, even without being a film major.Regardless of the overstayed visit, the movie was below mediocre. It spent all of its time trying to be this huge mystery on which of the elite 10 is killing off the remaining friends. For the most part, they not only overdo it, but they zoom in on a face and pretty much say It is this guy! No! It is this gal! You will spend more time with the camera misleading you than actually enjoying the movie. And do not get me started on the acting.Okay, that got me started. I had to laugh in the beginning trying to remember if Melissa Sue Anderson played the character that went blind on Little House on the Prairie later, research proved my suspicions correct because all the way through this movie, she genuinely looked blind. Strange, as an established actress, she should have been the best of the group, but turned out the worst. The rest of the staff, aside from Ann Bregman was pretty damn bad, too, but she, uh, took the cake.The movie begins with a group of ten friends, and ones immediately killed off. Barely anyone thinks twice of this dear friends disappearance, so they continue on their merry way. Slowly, then more rapidly, there are revelations about Virginias Anderson, the main character, past and her psychologist, who is a tad bit more personal AND ON CALL 247, apparently than most shrinks. All the while, more and more deaths occur.What is funny is, just as the first disappearance, the more best buds vanish, the less the rest care. Sure, they give a few seconds of air time to say Wow, that person just would not run off etc, but then they are back to their sexual ways. And speaking of which, it is probably due to the horrid script, or maybe it was I who was losing interest at minute 30, but it was really hard to keep up with who liked who of the group as they all seemed to be sexual partners of the next or someone would either be freaked out to the MAX by another and best friends the next scene. SEE the creepy guy that kept a mouserat in his pocket \u0096 literally \u0096 and was the most obvious suspect. I am giving the film too much credit and time, but how he became part of the elite 10 I will never know.But, I digress, there is a mystery here. Why are these kids targets? Why is Virginia thinking she is killed someone, when it was never proved till the end that any of them actually has been slaughtered? And why would the trailer and poster claim these killings to be Six of the most bizarre murders you will ever see? Hell, even for 1981, most of these had been shown in any of the first two Friday the 13th films \u0096 coincidentally enough, Friday the 13th Part 2 was released 2 weeks to the day of Happy Birthday to Me. Perhaps, they are speaking of when they filmed it months prior, but were late to the, well, party.When the secrets are revealed, trust me, you will have to rewind 34x to actually get the laughable and incoherent motives, and even then, put the subtitles on to get all the mumbling victimkillers words. Even if you get the first time, it is an unbelievably outrageous and hilarious finale. It is almost worth watching the whole movie again, but as a drinking game.This birthday gathering should be avoided. It is a horrible and illogical first draft script \u0096 please, please know it takes multiple rewrites before the cameras role, it contains either way under acting or extreme over acting and it is 100 unrealistic on how people react in extraordinary circumstances.Side Note When I was a kid, or say 1011 years old, I loved horror films. Still do, oddly. Definite guilty pleasures, but they are getting harder and harder to watch as years pass. We got our first VCR, and I taped as many horror films off network or, EDITED VERSIONS TV. All I remember of Happy Birthday to Me is getting the last 10 minutes on tape, which scared me to death \u0096 and obviously gave away the big mystery on who the killer was. Even though I have seen other clips of this movie, I think this is the first fulllength viewing I have had. Thankfully, this awful movie did not wound me as a child. I am older now, and I can take this trash. But never again.Side Note 2 That said, that crazy Happy Birthday to Me song played in the end credits and as a score throughout still creeps me out tremendously.

It has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot, lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performancecharacter from its supposed male lead Jimmy Fallon.Fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that. He is supposed to be a teacher you see, and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach. The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable, but old reliables like John Cusack or Adam Sandler might have been able to give it a shot. Not Fallon, who is neither funny, nor an actor, but appears to think he is both. Not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe Fallon in his role, or believe that there is any way these two people should, or would be together. Near the end of the movie there is a scene where Barrymore who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone  its hard to have a one person romance tells Fallon that its over, too much has happened, and she is moving on. And rather than feeling bad about the scene, or sorry for Fallon, you are actively cheering her on  finally she does what she should have done months ago. But of course the plot mechanics will not allow that to be the end of it an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess, and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions.

After his initial introductions, we are lead into the homes of two particular families; The Webbs and the Gibbs.This is most definitely middle America at the turn of the century, and the progressive way of life of the American Dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town. Here we see the everyday lives of some of its 2642 populace of Grovers Corners, New Hampshire, even if there are, too, the migrant Polish workers that add another 500 to is numbers, they, never get a lookin.Once the daily lives of these families have been introduced; wives cooking, children homeworking, fathers working, kids falling in love and the clean picketfences painted white, the second act is started three years later, after young George a young and unrecognisable William Holden, then aged 22 and Emily have fallen in love and intend to marry. Blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching, too, a turning point in their own lives, from the nest they lived and now, into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step. The third act is slightly more sour and foreboding, it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent, here we see not life, not celebration but death, and it is in this predicament that the dead, as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past, are here to remind us, to tell us, that life, and every last minute, every precious breath is not to be wasted and squandered.It is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too, feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on, and by, middle America and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order. This is not just about Our town, this is moral diction aimed at Our souls and how America can better itself if its peoples, excluding the Poles, the Irish, the Native American and the freed ethnic minorities, and minorities in general, plus the supporting backbone of the Americanas who, still, have not had a fair part in this narrative, such as the middle classes, can live up to the expectations of the American Dream through honest, decent living. The purveyors of the American Dream with special invitation only.I was entertained, slightly, by this movie too, but I felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting, the musical score or how well, or not, it was made. This was the movies intention to exclude other groups, and to only include the likes of the Webbs and the Gibbs, in the future of the developing country of the USA, a good movie, but also a slightly biased in its stance, I thought.Taken from the play by US born Thornton Wilder 1897  1975 this Pulitzer Prize winning play, and six Academy Award nominated movie, was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes; Life, love and death, the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness. Our Town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness, like other towns, nothing too exciting ever happens here, if anything at all, this town only has the right sort of people, you can still leave your backdoor unlocked here, we are seeing the developing lives of these two families, but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves.

But Last Exit to Brooklyn fails to bring these stories to any conclusion...it leaves some of them dangling with no ending, or blasts off into some bizarre stratosphere for an artistic ending.Two cases in point, and they contain spoilers.A sad transvestite character an important character in the film, is struck by a car and killed. And that is it for him in the movie....he is gone for good, erased from everyones memory..no reactions from his friends, enemies, lovers....nothing.In another thread the stupid, clueless, and secretly gay strike leader, having been rejected by labor, his gay lover, and found out by the neighborhood thugs, gets stomped by the thugs. The closing scene to the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the streetlights are very, very similar to those of Nazi death camps...and the scene drags on and on and on...and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader, and he is been crucified.....ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course that is it for him too....brain erasure.....gone.Bottom line....no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this film....this movie is a depressing piece of sludge. Avoid it. And if you do not be forewarned, it really deserves an NC17 rating for massive amounts of physical, emotional and sexual brutality...do not even let the teenagers watch.","label":0},{"index":12250,"txt":"I was drawn to this movie, curious to see how they have adapted Hubert Shelbys brutal novel. I thought that a literary piece of such depth, with a rich tapestry of characters, horrid situations, and social critique could not translate into a bad movie. I was wrong.This flick is a terrible movie experience, not for its content, but for its form. Director Ulrich Edel executes, in my sincere opinion, a terrible directorial job that does no justice to the original book. No wonder Edel is a TV director; this movie looks and feels like a bad made for TV flick. Some of my views on this bomb spoilers ahead Lack of directorial creativity. The scenes are slow, feel slow, look poorly shot, and barely ever move from an anchored position. The only liberty they take is in the cinematography area, with a nice dark tone. Other than that, the movie has the same technical creativity as a TV soapopera. All the actors do a terrific job at portraying these miserable characters. The problem is that the adaptation does not tackle a basic element in the development of the plot MOTIVATION. All these characters move around like robots, without a clear motivation for their action. They seem to do things out of the blue, like robots, for no reason at all. Edel misses every opportunity to enrich character development by not exploring the characters motivations, and by avoiding developing each characters personality to its full extent.This lack of character development is blatant on Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight does a great job playing this trashy prostitute, but her alcoholinduced decision to let the sailors violate her is not explained. It looks extremely stupid, as we see this character doing this out of the blue. This is a clear example of poor character development.The movie also has many secondary, token characters that do nothing, feel nothing, and add nothing to the plot. I would have liked to learn more about Harrys wife, for instance, and the interaction between the two. That is another missed opportunity.Edel only approaches character development with Harry and his fixation with his gay lover, only to screw it up at the end, not clearly explaining again his motivations. The thugs are also a joke in their lack of development. The soundtrack is one of the worst I have ever experienced. Terrible job by Mark Knopfler. I seriously expected more from the former leader of Dire Straits, but his job in this movie is seriously lacking. At times, like in the battle between the union workers and the police, the music seems totally disconnected from the movie. It also feels completely poor and anachronic; I could swear the whole soundtrack was made with a Casio toy keyboard. It distracts from the actual action. The book adaptation by Desmond Nakano is so literal that eliminates the point of the story. It feels as if they tried so hard to keep the actionbyaction storyline in the book, that they forgot to actually develop the characters and, once again, explain their actions and motivations.I seriously can not recommend this movie, not even to a Shelby fan, because it can ruin the original book. It is a very uninspired effort in adapting the novel, and shows very little creative input.","label":0},{"index":12251,"txt":"I am sure that Operations Dames was a favorite at the driveins back in the day. There is absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise preoccupied.

Bad enough already, but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of USO girls and their choreographer in the same predicament.You know what is sad about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the Army and in combat situations. These bimbos from the USO set womens liberation back light years. In fact not even the hard bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pants.But that was probably the better to remind some what they were at the drivein for.

That is the only reason I can think of why this horrible romantic comedy and I use that term loosely because there is nothing funny in this film is getting good reviews.I sat through this film stunned that screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny.The brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well to film. He adapted Fever Pitch for a British film starring Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell in 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornbys voice for About a Boy 2002 and when High Fidelity was Americanized for a movie in 2000, writers D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg did not go wrong because they kept the essence of Hornbys wit and humor. They made one of the best films of that year.So why does the American version of Fever Pitch go so painfully awry? The British version was not a masterpiece, but it was charming, funny, unexpected and gave us two characters we could like, respect and understand.But Ganz and Mandel have excised everything funny in Hornbys work. In Americanizing the story, they have butchered it, removing all that was good and unique about Hornbys work and replacing it with conventional drivel.They have transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy, never once veering from the wretched formula. Lindsey Drew Barrymore has three girlfriends, each of whom has a distinct function. Ones overweight, the seconds cynical and ambitious, and the thirds a romantic. Want to guess how many male friends Ben Jimmy Fallon has?What made High Fidelity such fun was not only a good leading man and lady, but engaging supporting characters. In this Fever Pitch, the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny. They are so insignificant, they are not even decorative. The only reason they are in the film is because the formula demands it. Poor Ione Skye winds up as one Lindseys pals in a thankless role. The lovely Skye must have been wishing Lloyd Dobler would swoop in and take her away. Come to think of it, Cusack would have made an excellent Ben. Of course, Cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script.There is not a single, solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced. Every plot turn is predictable, every lame joke telegraphed. Ganz and Mandel labor for laughs. The first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow, you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy. You can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch. It is almost as if Ganz and Mandel penned this with some screen writing gurus formula pasted on the wall. When they got to a certain page, they looked up at the formula and said, OK, the guru says this has to happen now. And, presto!Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly do not help the film any. They have no concept how to introduce their story and characters they hand over the V.O. narration not to the protagonist, but to another guy who sits behind Ben at Fenway Park. Thanks to some extremely clunky writing, we have to watch Barrymore and Fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings.Barrymore does cute and adorable better than most. She is as good at it as Goldie Hawn in her heyday. But even her cuteness cannot save this extraordinarily awful film. She tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story. About 30 minutes into the film, Lindsey tells Ben, You are funny. The only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script. For Fallons Ben never says anything even remotely funny. Fallon is neither witty nor funny; when he does comedy, he overacts.Fallon was never any good on Saturday Night Live. He was quite possibly the least funny person on that show. Remember that lame sketch about a radio DJ who did all the voices? The only reason Weekend Update worked occasionally was because Fallons cohort, Tina Fey, knows a thing or two about comedy.Actors who think they are funny and behave that way rarely, if ever, are actually funny. That is true of Fallon. He thinks he is hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle. His stuttering, unsureofhimself shtick did not work on the small screen; it is lousier on the big screen.Unfortunately for Fallon, his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments. If you thought his comedy was bad, wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff. Two scenes in particular  the first in a park, the second in front of Bens school  are painful to watch. The scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability, but Fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work. His range of emotions does not even run the gamut from A to B.Ben has no personality or depth. Often, he comes across as an oaf. And not a lovable one at that. It boggles the mind what Lindsey would find attractive about him. Compare Fallons performance to Firths in the British version, and you will understand how terribly flat, unfunny and forced Fallons Ben is and how wrong he is for this role. Watching Fallon in Fever Pitch makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of Ashton Kutcher!Just as High Fidelity did, an Americanized Fever Pitch could have worked brilliantly. It just needed better writers, more competent directors and, most definitely, a stronger, funnier, smarter leading man. Do yourself a huge favor Avoid this rotten film; rent the 1997 British version and read Hornbys book, instead.","label":0},{"index":12254,"txt":"Good lord, whoever made this turkey needs to be buried alive.

There are no big names in this film and the acting is very cheesy. The perception of paintball is pretty bad too. They seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this other crap. It just was a lousy movie in my opinion and does not give a real perception what paintball is.

Is being a moral person good enough, or do you need something more?The movie preaches that without the guidance of God, being a morally good person is not enough. There is a line early in the movie, You and I can look at a person who is morally good, but both know he is going to go to hell.While I am not a Christian, the discussions about this throughout the course of the movie were fascinating, but not in the way the movie intended. I left the movie with a stronger feeling that being morally good is enough. The arguments and discussions presented were heavily biased, so much so that they crush themselves in the weight of their own ignorance. Fanaticism can be a powerful thing, especially when inferenced in the minds of the ignorant and uneducated. As George Carlins character in Dogma said hook em while they are young.The basic premise is a very interesting one also. A Bible Scholar from the 1890s is attempting to publish a book that says that morality without God is OK, as long as the morality is meaningful. Do you only tell a child not to steal? Or do you tell him not to steal because God tells you not to? not bothering bringing up that telling the child not to steal because, well, how would he feel if it was his marbles that were stolen?The author, Carlisle, wants the recommendation of his school to help sell the book to spread the world. However, it needs unanimous consent, and one of the scholars opposes it. He brings up, in a very interesting discussion early in the film about the morality for moralitys sake vs Gods words argument. To prove his point, he produces a time machine put in the movie solely to make the plot work, which I am fine with, and sends Carlisle to the year 2002 to see where teaching morality without God will lead us.As should be obvious, he has his opinion, and is changed by what he sees, and has reversed himself by the time of his return for he does return, that is not really a spoiler, this is a bible movie after all.As for the movie as a movie itself, it is pretty slow and pretty poorly acted. Something that was not needed in this movie, is that it produces two bad guys who want to try to figure out who Carlisle is, even tho he has not hurt anyone, committed a crime, or anything. What is wrong with the movie just showing Carlisles opinion, showing his view of this sinful world, and returning him with a new viewpoint? Also, there a few points in the movie which affirm to me that I am happy I am not a Christian, or at least someone who says It is God or nothing. Three near the end of the movie rather disturbed me.. first, when the two bad guys corner Carlisle right before he jumps, Carlisle does his only truly despicable act.. he fakes like his timejump is the coming of Jesus, and makes it so the bad guys who are also Christians btw, oddly enough, think they just missed the rapture. Secondly, after Carlisle returns, he finds a boy in which he scolded at the beginning of the movie about not stealing but not mentioning God, kid kept the marbles and ran away, and tells him this time that stealing is wrong because God commands it. Like the Carlin quote above, scaring kids into religion is a fauxpas in my book.And lastly, the epilogue. Another scare tactic. Carlisle asks the inventor how far into the future they could go, and he says he does not know.. the epilogue shows him trying to warp a bible into the distant future starts at 2100, and it fails.. he keeps decrementing the years by 10, and trying again, and by the fadeout, he is at like 2030 or so. Throughout the movie, Carlise mentions that he felt the end of the world coming, because the world was rife with sin and the loss of the name of God.. scare tactics have been in use for thousands of years.. you would think in these enlightened times, the church would have enlightened as well.I am glad I saw this movie.

An interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead a lot of people. In addition, I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable. Never before had I wished for a negative score to rate a movie. So, if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority, then by all means, get this film. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi, because the title will deceive a lot of people as well. This was an unfortunate film, because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered. The films only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the Time Machine probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future.","label":0},{"index":12312,"txt":"I picked up Time Changer because it looked like a nice lowbudget scifi time travel movie and I was in the mood for something like that. The description said it had something to do with some biblical stuff and time travel but I did not expect a fundamentalist Christian film!The movie had decent special effects and an interesting premise that could have gone places and been far more interesting than it ended up being. Our hero, who is a bible professor from the 1890s, eventually travels forward to the 2000s and finds that modern life is filled with the influences of evil  Jesus is nowhere to be found. This wonderful technological feat is accomplished with the assistance of a fellow bible teacher who somehow managed to invent a functional HGWellsstyle time machine. The movie starts to lose some credibility at this point, which is unfortunate because this happens very early in the film. Earlier or perhaps immediately later, cannot remember for certain, our hero professor was seen teaching what appeared to be a science class where he claimed that scientific findings could only be considered validated if it could be matched with what the bible says. What should be obvious to anyone is that this is clearly not what the scientific method is about, however it is presented such that the filmmakers appear to prefer the point of view that science is useful only if it supports their claims and otherwise is not useful.In any case, that belief is perfectly valid and sensible in the context of the character at the time. So, if we accept that as the fact of life for these bible professors, then obviously the professor who went and invented the time machine is not a very strong believer as I do not think there is any evidence and none was offered for the physics of time travel in the bible. So immediately there is a problem with mixed messages and credibility there, but never mind...After the professor is convinced to take the leap into the future, the shock of modern technology was handled quite well in most cases. It was also fun to not have it pinned down to an exact year as the character is reading the date off a newspaper to himself, a car honks a horn and it scares him into not finishing the date it is just two thousand and... honk. Some of the shock went on a little too long, though. For instance, the car was one of the first things he encountered when he arrived and around two days later he is invited to a church movie night and takes a ride in a van. He sticks his head out the window like a dog might, is scared by the headlights and the starting engine, etc. That seemed a bit off since he would been there a few days by this point and the city appeared to be quite busy with traffic. In any case, that is easy to ignore. The rest of the tech shock was well done  especially his first encounter with the TV which was delayed because he did not even realize what it was until he saw a kid watching one and using a remote.Unfortunately, our hero predictably starts to preach to virtually everyone he meets as if he is an authority on all life and religion just because he is from the past and is an elder. Eventually he gets himself a brief moment in the spotlight at the church he had been visiting where he proceeds to explain his concept of Christianity to them in a long monologue that was supposed to be moving and insightful, but mostly was just more of the same. A couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this guy go figure and investigate his name. They eventually conclude that he either is a time traveler or is impersonating this long dead bible professor and decide to find out which it is. The movie frames these guys as nonbeliever bad guys for being skeptical.Just before the professor is to head back to his own time, he is confronted by those two men. In an effort to avoid being arrested or hauled away, he eventually breaks into an almost insanelike rant about how Jesus is coming soon and that he is a prophet so they should listen to him. Just in time, he is whisked away and one of the husbands wonders if perhaps this is the rapture he would heard so much about.The irony is that this essentially means the professor became a selfproclaimed and most likely false prophet claiming to know that the rapture was near and he was sent by God when truthfully he was sent by his fellow bible professor and did not have any Godgiven knowledge that was stated or even hinted at.As I understand it, Revelation claims that the time of the end is only for God to know and at the end of the film we see the inventor professor trying and failing to send a bible into the future. First 2080, then 2070, etc. as the scene fades out. Clearly he is trying to determine the exact date of the end times  which he should not be able to know! Essentially, the entire premise of the movie cancels itself out because by being so insistent on their religious beliefs and how certain things are for God to know only, it means there could not ever BE a time machine in the first place because then mankind could find out something that only God should know! The entire movies premise collapses and makes the whole thing basically worthless as it undermines it is own credibility in the end.","label":0},{"index":12313,"txt":"Falsely accused, skirtchasing chums John Wayne as John Scott and Eddy Chandler as Kansas Charlie change identities to become Alias Smith and Jones.

The opening scene sets the stage literally for the personalities of the gambler, Kansas Charlie Eddy Chandler, and his buddy, John Scott John Wayne the rodeo say RohDayoh star, both of whom are slightly randy. The film follows their adventures, as they try to best each other in the pursuit of the Mexican Juanita, and later in their pursuit of perky Mary Kornman, who has the inevitable evil brother though he would been led astray by the real villain, and wants to repent. And oh, of course, they are being wrongly accused of two crimes and have to serve jail time before escaping and being exonerated at the end.The high point is Scott continually and deliberately ogling Marys butt in her grocery store, and knocking away the ladder she is standing on so he can catch her and grab her as she falls. It all seems a little contemporary for a 30s western, but it sounds better than it actually is. Sadly, the exciting action elements we find in many other Lone Stars are sorely missing here. No Yakima Canutt. Cheap and bad uses of stock footage of riders falling off horses. No George Hayes. Tedious Stoogelike biplay between Scott and Charlie, with Charlie swinging at Scott, Scott stomping on his foot and then punching him repeated two more times!. The skilled Paul Fix is underused. Eddy Chandler himself, here in his big star turn, is not really believable as a randy side kick. The villain looks too old and fat. So does Chandler, who spent his later career in 300 more movies as an uncredited meatloaf. Mary Kornman, of the twenties Our Gang see Mary, Queen of Tots 1925 is cute in her scenes with John Wayne, but that is about it for this one. Seeds of a better western lie buried here.P.S. The ultrashort colorized version, which looks good, moves along so fast, it is over if you blink more than once. Thankfully though, the embarrassing scenes with Eddy Chandler have been cut.","label":0},{"index":12315,"txt":"Before I explain the Alias comment let me say that The Desert Trail is bad even by the standards of westerns staring The Three Stooges. In fact it features Carmen Laroux as semi bad girl Juanita, when you hear her Mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as Senorita Rita from the classic Stooge short Saved by the Belle. In The Desert Trail John Wayne gets to play the Moe Howard character and Eddy Chandler gets to play Curly Howard. Like their Stooge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53 minute movie is Moe hitting Curly. Waynes character, a skirt chasing bully, is not very endearing, but is supposed to be the good guy. Playing a traveling rodeo cowboy Wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been goodthe other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar actually even less after Wayne robs the box office. No explanation is given for Waynes ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl. Things get complicated at this point because the villain Al Ferguson and his sidekick Larry Fine played by Paul Fixwho would go on to play Sheriff Micah on televisions The Rifleman see Wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager. Moe and Curly get blamed. So Moe and Curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to Smith and Jones. Who do they meet first but their old friend Larry, whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest Senorita Rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie. Larrys sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful Mary Kornman now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of Hal Roachs Our Gang shorts. Kornman is the main reason to watch the megalame western and her scenes with Moe and Curly are much better than any others in the production, as if they used an entirely different crew to film them. Even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film making is staggeringly bad. The two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse. Both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground, but there is no horse in the frame, the film stock is completely different, and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider. There is liberal use of stock footage in other places, none of it even remotely convincing. One thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where Moe and Curly get on their horses and ride away to screen right from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left. The cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse. Outside of home movies I have never seen anything like this, not because it is looks stupid which it does but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner. They would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action. Or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background. Then again, what do I know? I am only a child.","label":0},{"index":12316,"txt":"John Scott John Wayne and partner Kansas Charlie Eddy Chandler are trail buddies who make their way to the Rattlesnake Gulch rodeo. Scott is a pretty fair contestant, but finds that unless he is willing to accept twenty five cents on the dollar in prize money from a crooked promoter, he will have to collect his winnings at gunpoint. Quite coincidentally, bandits Pete Al Ferguson and Jim Paul Fix decide they would like the rest of the rodeo take; they shoot promoter Farnsworth Henry Hall, and make it look like Scott and Kansas Charlie are the killers. Wayne and Chandler use a running gag in the film where they are about to go at it with their fists over various trivialities. Each time Chandler takes a wild swing, Wayne foot stomps him and knocks him silly.If you are very attentive, there is a neat Liptons Tea ad in one of the scenes in which Scotts love interest Anne Mary Kornman appears.Later on in the film, the buddies are framed once again over a stage robbery. Having a change of heart and seeing the error of his ways, bad guy Jim wants to come clean and confess to the sheriff, but Pete shoots him down. While being patched up, Jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister Anne. In an unbelievable scene, Anne marches right into the middle of a gunfight between the good guys and the villains to confront the sheriff.The Desert Trail is one of the blander John Wayne Westerns from Lone Star Productions during this era. Noticeably absent are George Gabby Hayes and Yakima Canutt, one or both are usually to be seen in these oaters. If you are a John Wayne fan though, you will have to see it once, but that will probably be enough.","label":0},{"index":12317,"txt":"This early John Wayne Lone Star western has a bit more going for it than the runofthemill oaters Wayne had been making for Lone Star up until that time. For one, it has his old friend Paul Fix in it; Fix, being a much better actor then the standard Lone Star villain, brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant linereadings often delivered in these oaters. The plot, about mistaken identity, payroll robbery and murder, is as trite and perfunctory as you would expect it to be in a 1930s lowbudget western, but Waynes strapping good looks, easygoing charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable. Plump, balding Eddy Chandler is not quite believable as Waynes womanizing partner, and there is a running gag about something that happens whenever Chandler and Wayne are about to get into a fistfight that grows tiresome. On the other hand, Waynes love interest is played by none other than Mary Kornman, the little Mary of the early Little Rascals fame. She is a grownup 20yearold now, blonde and cute as a button. Most of Waynes leading ladies in these Lone StarMonogram Bs were fairly bland and colorless, but Mary is perky, cute and, yes, sexy. There is a scene in the general store, where she works, in which Wayne asks her to get him a bottle of nerve tonic, which happens to be on the top shelf, so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf. Waynes ogling her pert little backside as she ascends the steps, then again as she comes down, then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935. Wayne makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt. Anyway, it is an interesting little B, not great, but not as choppy and random as many of his LoneStar productions of the time. The final gunfight is not handled all that well, and Chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while, but all in all, it is worth a look, if only to see a cute and sexy Mary Kornman.","label":0},{"index":12318,"txt":"This movie is horrendous.

How a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me. Also how Marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me.The Garden Of Allah, one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by Robert Hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with Mary Anderson that ran for 241 performances in 191112. It then got two silent screen adaptions. The story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in French Tunisia to see some of what he is missed in the world. He runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent. She is traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train.The woman is of course Marlene and the runaway monk is Charles Boyer. I am not sure what was in David O. Selznicks mind in filming this story. Someone like Ingrid Bergman might have made it palatable for the audience. But you can bet that the moviegoing public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see Marlene as a modern day Salome rather than a saint with that title. The public still remembered Rudolph Valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting.As for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which Boyer happens to be the one with the secret. The monastery will have to rethink it is economics if Boyer leaves. The monks are a sincerely pious group, but from the head man Charles Waldron on down they have a right to be a little concerned with some self interest.Anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts. Most especially Marlene Dietrich.

The overdone, obviously theatrical sets, the overdone, obviously theatrical acting, the overdone, obviously theatrical directing  well, you get the idea. Allegories do not need to be delivered sledge hammer style. And it is hard to feel much of anything for Julian Po because we never know much about him.

The premise is wonderful, and I loved the voiceover, confessional tone the opening narration strikes. But then...? Nothing! Several of the cliched local characters ask Julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. One could argue that he does not answer, because it is none of their business. But Julian is the one who, under only token pressure, blurted out his intentions in public. Then neither Julian nor the directorwriter, despite the fact that the Julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for Gods sake, seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on Julians life. He says he was a bookkeeper. He says his family moved around when he was a child, due to his fathers job. So what? There are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate Julians purpose. But none of them go anywhere, because Julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet, as if he were the ultimate and only sane one among them. This might work as an allegory, if Julian Po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart. The closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive, religious wife of the mechanic. And what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for Julian. I can only see the Julian character as renderedas selfish, petty, and totally condescending.

Honestly, I hate Cryptozoology. It is unscience, it just destroy it. However, something positive in this was the visual effects dragons were beautiful, but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake, and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists, so that is the reason why it deserves a 1 of 10 and not a 0. An example of false information would be the hydrogen idea It is true that, according to Chemystry, the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions, so in that case, you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach. There are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly, and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing, so it is impossible. Anyway, there is actually something worse, the idea of the platinum This element is more difficult to find than gold, and I cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that. It is ridiculous, they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet Earth, but off course at least that explain why they got extincted. Probably cryptologists call themselves scientists, but they are not. People like them say lies like in this mockumentary, and what is worst, some people buy them.

CGI to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragons life. This is combined with popularTVshowCSIstyle flashforwards to make it look like something scientific, which it is definitely not. In many cases the argumentsclues are farfetched. In some cases, clues used to show dragons possibly existed, or flew, or spit fire are simply invalid. To see this just makes me get cramp in my toes.

The major obstacle to the familys stability and happiness is his wife, Christina Franka Potente, who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly shacking up with other men. Despite her highly unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to grant her a divorce, masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him. It is, unfortunately, the goodhearted and goodnatured Raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil  and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the movie Raimond Gaita would later grow up to be an author.Even though I admire Romulus, My Father for what it is trying to do, I cannot honestly say I enjoyed it, for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it, these simply are not enough to counteract the dour storyline and funereal pacing, which leave the audience as despairing and depressed as the people on screen.

Granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s, if it ever truly existed. It is a shame, as the films overall tone is poignant and wry, and there is some promise in the scenario but few of the details convince.

Fact is, I down right hate it. I tried to watch it as open minded as possible, but when it gets down to it, it feels rather insulting to my social group.To me, there are several reasons why.1. The characters seem unnatural. I have met lots of players, of all different walks of life. I do not know any who act like any of the characters in the film. It is like the producers of the film have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into 5 people. Most gamers are rather social people, some with rather active lives.2. The style does not work. The mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film. An actual documentary on gamers would actually work better. While it is good looking I.E. cleanly put together, it is not very good.3. The dialogue feels forced, unnatural. It also seems to lack any real world context. Gamers swear, I will admit that, but we do not have Tourettes Syndrome.4. The humor is lacking. While selfdeprecating humor is a mainstay of my group and several other groups I have encountered, this is less selfdeprecation, and more like toilet humor. Likewise, a large part of gamer humor is full of injokes and anecdotes, not toilet humor. Most gamers would balk at and shun anybody who made such jokes.5. The biggest problem to me is basically this Accuracy. I do not mean rules, but instead dynamics. Invariably, this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films The Gamers and The Gamers Dorkness Rising, both of which portray the players as actual people playing an actual game.

In fact, it sounded to me as if she was practically reading excerpts from the novel in her voice over.2 I felt no emotion in the relationship between Jessie and Brother Thomas and also felt that Alex Carters acting was pretty bad. That is a significant failure for me in defining Jessies and Thomas characters  with no connection between them, it seemed to me as if she just wanted a stud and that for him it was a matter of being sexdeprived.

Anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man, and if this happened to be a bad film, it would be his first bad film. Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day, this is Andersons first bad day in film making, so I am going to let him off easy.

The worrying thing is that I think it was, and this is the best that Wes Anderson could come up with.The animation is good in the closeup shots of the animals, however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess. There was not really anything special about the acting either, with Wes opting to choose his buddies and big names over more specialised voice actors that could have probably made the film better. I am pretty sure George Clooneys voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in South Park, one of them where he played a dog.The film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically, despite the film being set in England, all the good animals are typical Americans playing baseball, whilst the bad guys are stereotypical English with the most insulting English accents.

That is right, one short, one fat, one lean, or however it goes.I do not quite know where to start with my criticism.Well, I am in my late teens and was never a fan of Roald Dahl, but I like his material well enough, having read a few of his books as a child and seen Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory over and over again. This film, however, struggles for an audience. Is it aimed at children? Adults? I am still unsure! Many of the jokes would bore a child, especially as Mr. Fox visits a lawyer for example, or complains about being poor. Also, an audience of I am assuming children is expected to sympathise with a character who steals and kills chickens. I am all for the food chain, but you practically see Mr. Fox biting down on their necks! Surely that is a bit much? And also, the plot... well, it is kind of boring. I stayed only with the hope of it getting better, but instead I just got more and more annoyed at Mr Fox and his son Ash for making stupid decisions.The humour, meanwhile, falls flat. I laughed only once or twice, even though I specifically recognised attempts at jokes. I think part of it is that the voice acting is so incredibly flat and monotoned. The voice actors have no sense of comic timing, instead aiming for the subtlety of humour that only works with certain mediums. George Clooney aims to portray Mr. Fox as charming and sleek, but his voice has no character. Meryl Streep shows no emotion, I did not even realise Bill Murray had a role until the end credits, and Ash, twelveyears old in foxyears, sounds like he is about 30.I love animation, particularly stop motion, but the visual style actually creeped me out a little bit. Characters are tall, spindly and lacking any warmth of design. They move with very little fluidity and often the animation is jerky and strange. There is also a distinctive mixed medium feel, as 2D components are added in sporadically and unsuccessfully. Characters look straight at the camera and talked; it was very awkward. There was one or two moments when Kylie looked straight at the camera, did not move and had swirls on his eyeballs. It actually freaked me out.Fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential.

Well, it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a halfforgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them. As bizarre settings go, it is a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is Dead Letter Office. Having said that, this is obviously an Australian film as opposed to a British one. If it was Royal Mail, most letters get this sort of treatment anyway. I have not been in this flat for two years and we are still getting letters for a Mr Wang, some female priest of the Church of Latter Day I haveNeverHeardOfYou and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company.Dead Letter Office the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up follows the story of Alice Miranda Otto who grows up in a seriously divided home. Writing to her absent father, she only learns in adulthood that her letters have not been delivered for one reason or another. So, logically, she gets a job at the D.L.O. and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding Chilean immigrant Frank Lopez George Del Hoyo. Slowly, she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the selfcontained world of the Dead Letters Office to its knees?Nothing against this film but I was reminded of the godawful Heather Graham film Committed while watching this. However, this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again, that as not difficult. For a start, this film is much more logical. True, the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood. But at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel. It is also well acted. Both Otto and Del Hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they will never find while other characters are peripheral at best. Part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly, leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed. The other part is that when you consider Australias draconian immigration policy i.e. if you do not speak English, rack off!, such a story is unlikely to take place in reality. The other characters, sadly, also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than oddball stereotypes.Despite that, Dead Letter Office is certainly something a little different. It might not be to everyones taste but I liked it. Yes, it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes, it is nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavyduty swearing and nudity no chance of that in an Australian film. There as not any major laughs, there is no Bullet Time and the characters are usually onedimensional. But it is the story that counts here and while it is not earthshattering in its magnificence, it is a pleasant enough way of passing the time.

Period.I was 10 years old when this film came out; I was already a film maven at the time. Of course neither my parents nor I saw this film when it came out, but I was in love with the typeface of its ads  the aura that this was An Important Film. Okay, 34 years later I have finally seen the filmhaving never seen any Cassavetesdirected film previously. He is a hack, overall. Zero sense of timing, editing. Genas performance reminds me too much of Dustin Hoffmans stint in Rain Man technically on par but entirely onenote. As Tom Cruise stole Rain Man, Falk takes the cake for this film.I was annoyed with Genas performance, really throughoutit seemed better suited for Awakenings blecch!. It is not all her fault she is a basket case from first scene to last. We never find out why?? But Falks character seems real  is performed WONDERFULLY by Falk as a seriously flawed man.Shave off at least an hour an editor needed!, and this would have been an arresting portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple, CroMagnon, man coming to grips with a wife who does not work  yet cannot deal with her three kids  her husbands long hours of work.I would rather remember Cassavetes for The Dirty Dozen or Rosemarys Baby. He would have been a better director had he snipped his own tendency for excessas he amply demonstrates with this film.Bob","label":0},{"index":12372,"txt":"Cassavetes was clearly an intelligent, sensitive man with bold new ideas about making films. He wanted to be an auteur, to break away from the confines of the system and bring a new realism to the American cinema. For that, I applaud him.Unfortunately, as a member of his audience, I cannot applaud A Woman Under the Influence. Cassavetes took what could have been a fascinating topic an insane woman and somehow managed to craft a dull film, filled with lengthy, adlibbed ranting and drawnout scenes. He seems to have had a gift for capturing the dullest moments of a persons life on film, and it often appears as though he simply turned the camera on his family and let the motor run and run. This tactic would be acceptable if Cassavetes had captured something devastatingly REAL  or even a kernel of something so real it touched the heart in ways a conventional film could not. Yet I found the performances, particularly Rowlands, to be artificial. I never believed for a moment that she was really insane. I have met people who are truly mentally disturbed, yet I have never seen any of them act quite like Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence. She played it like a very obnoxious, uninhibited woman who drinks a lot, and even that was confusing because we only see her drink once at the beginning, but she acts drunk for the remainder of the film. There are some moments in which she taps into something real, but those moments are few and far between; she fails to sustain a seamless mentally disturbed character. Again, I applaud her efforts, but effort alone is not enough to make the performance ring true.Novice audiences who happen upon this film and see its high IMDb rating will no doubt feel compelled to love it and rate it highly, just to prove that they get it. But do not be brainwashed by the hype  judge for yourself. You do not have to pretend to like it.Like Woody Allen, John Cassavetes could be accused of solipsism in his filmmaking, seeming to find his own psyche and his own life experiences so endlessly fascinating that he could not imagine that to others they appeared presumptive and tortuously selfindulgent. But Woody Allen at least has demonstrated a gift for keeping an audience entertained  he knows that a compelling story structure and a good dose of humor are essential to any movie. If Cassavetes had employed some selfdiscipline and a sharp pair of editing shears!, A Woman Under the Influence could have stood a chance. But what is the point of making a realistic film if the only people who can stand to sit through it are the arthouse devotees and film students who worship Cassavetes as some sort of antiestablishment deity? Without dumbing anything down, I believe Cassavetes could have made A Woman slightly more accessible by keeping the pace moving with an actual plot, instead of presenting a string of 30 minutelong scenes of adlibbed arguments. If you just make films for yourself and a few of your fans, you are just reaching the already converted. Watch this movie with your own set of eyes and make your own decisions about it. If you are truly moved and fascinated by it, good for you.","label":0},{"index":12373,"txt":"From actor and independent writerdirector John Cassavetes, A Woman Under the Influence gives the viewer a look at a working class family with a problem of mental instability. The husband, Nick played by Peter Falk is a blue collar worker who has trouble showing his wife, Mabel played by Gena Rowlands the amount of attention that she deserves. From the onset of the film, it is obvious that Mabel is very quirky and strange, but only a few minutes later it is clear that she is much more than that. Crazy. Bonkers. Out of her damn mind. Nick tries his hardest to hide this from his coworkers, and after she has a particularly strange incident at dinner, he asks her if she will be okay, as if he is trying to deny Mabels illness. Her problem only spirals from there.I did find some particular problems with this film. I guess these problems were mostly present in the story, and the way some of the character acted toward the end. Mabel has been committed, because, frankly, she is nuts. Then, six months later, she is ready to come out of the hospital, and her husband throws a party to welcome her back. He never acts stupid in the beginning of the movie. Why would he invite all these people, some of them strangers to Mabel, over to his house when his wife is in such a fragile state? It is simply idiotic. Later, after Mabel comes in the house, Mabels father has a huge outburst at Nick, screaming at the top of his lungs about not wanting to eat spaghetti. His daughter has just gotten back from six months of rehabilitation, and the thing you want to do is keep her calm, and he goes nuts over spaghetti? A few minutes later in the film, Nick brings Mabel into the stairwell and forces her to do the things she did when she was mentally unstable; make her weird noises and gestures. Did not he send her there to make her better and not do those things? There were various other parts that occurred after this, but it would just be redundant to look at them in more detail. I guess I just had a serious problem with the decision by Cassavetes to have his characters act in this way. It simply did not make sense.However, although I had problems with the ending of the film, there was one aspect that really redeemed it; the acting. Gena Rowlands played an amazing crazy woman. There were times when I forgot she was acting, where I got so caught up in her wild gesticulations and crazy talk that I was actually scared of her. She was amazingly convincing and intense. However, I was also impressed by the rest of Mabels family. Peter Falk played a very strange character, and I almost thought he was crazy himself, because of the awkward way he handled his children, his job, and especially the situation with his wife. I also usually do not appreciate child actors. But the young people who played Nick and Mabels children in this film were phenomenal. It really felt like they were Mabels children, because they seemed so attached to her and were so interesting in helping her with her problem. I think their performances are one of the things that kept this film together, and without them it would have made the film less realistic and less intense.In general I was not impressed by this film. The story was jumbled and unclear, and the characters acted in ways that made me wonder who was not insane in the movie. The only saving grace were brilliant lead acting roles of the Longhetti family. Their realistic dialogue and powerful acting kept the film together, and are probably the only reason the film has ever amounted to anything.","label":0},{"index":12374,"txt":"In A Woman Under the Influence Mabel goes crazy, but I can see why she does go crazy.

She is constantly surrounded by people yelling at her and telling her what is best for herself and people that are not the sharpest knifes in the drawer.To start with the one person closest to her in her life, her husband, Nick, is a little off his rocker. He is always yelling at her when he is home telling her how to live her life and to stop acting like an imbecile. The rest of the time he is working long hours at his job and he is not there to support her when she needs support. The one person in her life that should always be there for her is never there and if he is, he is just making her feel worse. She relies on him for support and always goes to him first when she feels she is acting wrong and he does nothing to support her. When she comes home from the hospital all he does is tell her how to act, instead of comforting her, he just yells at her and tells her what to do.The other major people in her life are her parents. Her parents do nothing in her life for her. Mabel basically runs their lives because they are afraid to stand up to her and stand up for her. In the end she even asks her father to stand up for her and he does not understand, and when he does get it he still does nothing. They do nothing to help Mabel recover or to keep her from going crazy because they do nothing for her period. The only person that tries to do something for her is Nicks mom. Nicks mom is adamant about having Mabel committed. She does not want to have Nick deal with it so she has the doctor commit her. It seems as though everyone is against Mabel and they feel that having her committed is a good idea because then they will not have to deal with it anymore. They all want to live their own lives and do nothing for Mabel except for yell at her and make her feel like she is doing something wrong when she really is not.

Admittedly, this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen, which is why Gladiator went over well, but Gladiator did not have all the romance novel sex.Miss Varela has as little acting talent as Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has talent to spare.

Though it is so inaccurate that I do not think they made an attempt for it to be correct, in which case it can be forgiven. The odd thing is that they sometimes go to great lengths to be historically accurate that it ends up getting confusing. Like throwing in Antonius marriage to Octavia, and then pushing it aside two scenes later. Why even bring it up if it serves no purpose for the plot and Octavia is never even seen? And like calling Antonius by his actual name Marcus Antonius in some scenes, and by his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes.Though historical inaccuracies aside, the film could still have been an entertaining watch if it was not for the leading lady. There is not an ounce of dignity in her. She is hysterical, dramatical, and completely lacking control of herself. Instead of being a clever and composed queen Cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of PMS. 95 of that comes from the poor acting, but 5 is also from poor script writing.

That was just about the plot line of every Scott, John Wayne, Roy Rogers film ever made. If you take the time to go back and review each and every movie  just do not ask for surprises.One must remember the context of the times. There was no or little TV. None for kids. There was school. There was the great outdoors. There were toy guns. No Cyber time. And the steam age had just collapsed. But movies such as this provided the entertainment and filled the imaginations of young whippersnappers. Even the girls got into it.This movie was the entertainment. And it is just as mindless as anything produced today. It had a purpose originally of being propaganda. But quickly came to be kids movies.Our fathers had experienced the real thing. And it would not be until Sam Peckinpah a decade later who finally lavished the red splashes of imitation blood in realistic and copious quantities. Not until his directorship did anyone die slowly, with great pain and miserably. Until Peckinpah war and gun fights were a rather bloodless affair. Thanks Sam.To see a movie had little or no blood, the adults did not mind. They would not have tolerated it I think. No guts spraying the shattering plant life. So this movie had all of the glory and none of the gory. Gung Ho was suitable for kids then.You will see that I assigned a four to this rating. Why would I do that? Well. It is a terrible movie. No matter how I love it. I do love this movie because it brought back one of the happier moments of my childhood. But it is not all that good of a movie in quality terms. Basically Gung Ho transitted to become a romance novel for children.Should people watch it. Of course. I am not saying to stay away. Realistically however. The plot is simple. The characters shallow? they are shoals. You can love a bad movie.","label":0},{"index":12395,"txt":"DVD has become the equivalent of the old late night doublebill circuit, the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like The Border. There were great expectations for this back in 1982 \u0096 a script cowritten by The Wild Bunchs Walon Green, Jack Nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast Harvey Keitel, Warren Oates, Valerie Perrine, Tony Richardson directing although he was pretty much a spent force by then \u0096 but now it does not even turn up on TV. The material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s American Dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption, with Nicholsons border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wifes relentless materialism, until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business. Unfortunately, he never really gets his hands dirty, barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface. The film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and, sadly, the recent DVD release is a missed opportunity to restore the original, nihilistic ending where Nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the films trailers.While that probably was not too convincing considering how lowkey Nicholsons crisis of conscience is in the film, it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity at one point he is holding characters at gunpoint, then he is somewhere else and they are free trying to kill him, one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the Rio Grande while Valerie Perrines character gets dumber on an exponential level. The villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease and one impressive car stunt in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely. What makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring. Unfortunately Ry Cooders beautiful title song, Across the Borderline, says it all much more economically. But if you want to know the films real crime, it is completely wasting the great Warren Oates in a nothing bit part. When even he cannot make an impression, you know somethings really wrong.

Stunned, not by the film, but by some of the rave reviews I perused which influenced my watching it. The story was so ravaged by plotholes and the majority of the acting so flat, categorizing it as a comedy seems appropriate. Seriously, I found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as I endured this movie.Justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killeraddicted mom to go live with his cop father despite Moms warnings that Dad is no good. When a young woman is found murdered, Justin becomes suspicious of the tenants who reside in the adjacent apartments. With the help of a couple pals, he installs covert cameras to keep tabs on these folks. As the truth begins to unravel, Justin uncovers an unexpected secret.One positive point is that Felissa Rose is HOT! I would have generously slapped an extra star or two on here had she peeled down a bit, but no such luck. It would have been the films potential saving grace. Eric Conley played Justin very adeptly, I thought, and I would not be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future.

Rigg Justins father. The horror! pardon the pun.I have nothing against lowbudget films. Indeed, I believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come. I will cut lowbudget films quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects, lighting, even musical score and the overall picture quality. I do not give allowances, however, for stick figure acting and a swiss cheese lovers script. There are a vast number of competentlymade low budget films out there. Sadly, this is not one of them.

I went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind most of that. But I came out of the theatre not knowing much more about Joe than I already did after reading the entry on Wikipedia. The movie never really gets through to the person, his thoughts and feelings. What they did was to collect the little material that they had, shaky blurry videos and to interview some people about Joe Strummer at a camp fire. It turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all, and that the director just wanted them in the movie in order to have some more celebrities say, Oh, he was such an inspiration to all of us. Like Bono or Johnny Depp whom they seemingly asked to keep his pirate costume on to benefit from his current success in Pirates of the Caribbean. It seems that the director could not even wait until the body was cold before he jumped in to sell his version of the greatest punk rocker and hippie at heart that ever lived, sanctifying the person without really knowing enough about him.Sure, being a fan i enjoyed seeing the images of the band, hearing the anecdotes behind the songs and such, but in the end I felt like what remained as the portrait of Joe Strummer could have easily been told in 6090 minutes.Go see the movie if you are a fan, otherwise better listen to some music of the Clash or even better the undeservedly unknown Mescaleros, where Joe Strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death, melting all his rich influences together to one amazing sound.","label":0},{"index":12411,"txt":"Strummers hippie past was a revelation, but overall this felt like crashing a wake.

The movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour.The campfire format, while touching in thought, is actually pretty annoying in execution. First off, without titles, its hard to even know who half of these interviewees are. Secondly, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp, and John Cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man? They were not relevant to Strummers life and their opinions add nothing to his story.This picture is at it is best when Strummer, through taped interviews and conversation, touches on facets of his life most people did not know about the suicide of his older brother, coming to terms with the death of his parents, the joy of fatherhood. To me, these were most moving because it showed Joe Strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved, but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face.There have been better, more straightforward documentaries about Strummer and The Clash.

Jules tells Vincent that the Only thing she did worthwhile was pilot. Vincent asks What the hell is a pilot? and Jules goes into a very well description of what a TV pilot is Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show is called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they are going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some do not, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. Now to stretch on what Jules was talking about, there are BILLIONS of television showspilots that were never aired because they simply were not...well, good. Probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is WALTER, a spinoff to MASH with Gary Radar Burghoff as the lead. Hmmm, would somebody really want to be watching Radar for a halfhour trying to solve crimes? Hence, the show was never picked up. What many people do not know or what they thought they knew is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air, for they are made strictly for the Television networks for them to decide. Some have made they are way past and got onto the air The pilot for the animated series American Dad comes to mind, as the show is serial itself did not begin until nearly four months later. However, there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air, and this here is why.Black Bart, a supposed tiein with the Mel Brooks comedy classic, Blazing Saddles, is a stale and bland sitcom with little heart and no soul. Saddles was a controversial comedy, nevertheless, with it is racist humor and vulgar comedy, which comes to mind what idiot decided this would make a great television show FOR PRIME TIME TV?!? I say supposed, because none of the memorable characters from the movie, aside from Bart, on in this mess of a TV show. Mel Brooks was not even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line In a related story, I recently found out about an unaired TV pilot for a series based on the movie Clerks. that Kevin Smith was no involved in....you see what happens?!?.Set somewhere around the same time as the movie or at all, the story circles around the only Black sheriff in the wild west, named appropriately Black Bart, who is this time played by future Academy Award winner Louis Gossett Jr., obviously before his stint in real acting, whereas in this he is playing a Grated Richard Pryor. Most of the other characters are carbon if not, really bad copies of the characters in the movie Jim, The Waco Kid is replaced by a similar looking character named Reb Jordan, a former Confederate soldier who is quick with the gun. Lilian Von Schtupp is now Belle Buzzer, a more of a ripoff of the character being that she is a show dancer and a German with a Marlene Dietrichtype accent and personality. While that is pretty much the end in similarities, The lead bad guy in the story is Fern Malaga, played by Noble Willingham, who I assumed would have been Hedley Lamar if Warner Bros. secured the rights to the name See trivia for Blazing Saddles and his son Curley...I dunno, Taggart I suppose? The story is a poor excuse for a sitcom, much less a pilot. Bart deals with the mayors drunk son and he is outofcontrol behavior which has caused the town to spin. Really, it is a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the series and does not focus on the variety and context that would make this an alright show. I cannot really call it a sitcom and even if I wanted to and that is primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at Warner Bros. Studios and later added a laugh track, so the show is set up almost exactly like MASH complete with a bland and dull laughing that is identical to the series. The acting is soso, but there is one part that always make me laugh, and that is when the actor playing Reb Jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue.

Apparently Matt Frewer was cast because he is tall and skinny. His skulllike face made for a good zombie in the Dawn of the Dead remake, but as Sherlock Holmes he looks like a scarecrow. Not only does Frewer have a lanky lackadaisical walk that is hard to watch, but he looks uncomfortable in the stereotypical Holmes overcoats that he is wearing. Not only that, but while the coat is gray twill they apparently could not find a matching cap. So his cap is black and it looks shiny as if it were made of polyester. Whatever the cap was made of, it looked very new and artificial. Jeremy Brett occasionally wore those traditional outfits, but Brett did not have to dressup like Sherlock Holmes in order to look the part. Frewer on the other hand is painful to watch. Even in the full Holmes outfit, he does not carry himself like Sherlock Holmes.Frewers cadaverous face grinning all the time as he spouts on and on in a very bad UpperCrust British accent is painful to see and listen to. To say that Frewer is overacting is an understatement. After he finishes each sentence with some kind of nasal hum, he then sneers as if that were some kind of British trait. When I started watching this I thought it might be a comedy featuring Wishbone, the Jack Russell Terrier. I thought Frewer had been cast as some kind of foil for Wishbone. But sadly, there is no dog in this movie except for Frewer. Wishbone would have made this movie a lot better.Not only does Frewers version of Sherlock Holmes never stop talking in that awfully artificial British nasal accent, but he is much to friendly and kind. Frewer is always smiling at the witnesses he talks to, and he is so polite and courteous that he could be teaching at a Charm School instead of being a Sleuth. Perhaps since this is a Hallmark Channel production, they are trying to make a childrens version of Sherlock Holmes Wishbone was better at that, too that was kindler and gentler. Whatever the point of Frewers interpretation of Sherlock Holmes, it is flatter than a pancake, and easily the worst version of Sherlock Holmes that I have ever seen including the previous worst, by Charlton Heston.Overall, the tone of this film is awful. It reminded me of a typical episode of Barnaby Jones or Murder She Wrote or Diagnosis Murder. All the suspects overacted suspiciously and glared at the victims before they were killed. Holmes and Watson are explaining every clue to each other during the entire movie. Even on Murder She Wrote there is less exposition.This Sherlock Holmes does not even compare very well to Jim Rockford of the Rockford Files and it is miles below Columbo. The awful dialog is probably the fault of the writer. It is obvious that who ever wrote this script has very little familiarity with Sherlock Holmes, especially the BBC version with Jeremy Brett. This movie has all of the atmosphere of an episode of Little House on the Prairie. The fact that the actors seem to be smirking when they enunciate their lines in their fake accents does not help.The only minor bright spot is Ken Walsh who plays Doctor Watson with some dignity. Walsh does not ham it up compared to Frewer, and when he is often interviewing witnesses, his demeanor and conversational style are much more natural and credible. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is amateurish, and the visual clues they give by glaring and making faces at each other to show they are suspicious is something that I had not seen in any modern movie.","label":0},{"index":12425,"txt":"As a casual listener of the Rolling Stones, I thought this might be interesting.

I expected drugs galore with th Stones, I was disappointed, it actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, So much so I felt as if I was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film. I have not seen any of the directors other films, but I suspect they follow a similar style of directing, sort of amatuerish which gave a feeling like the TV show Eurotrash, badly directed, tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value.

It is hard to credit that Godard actually believed all that Marxist and Maoist kant. Anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those isms and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as Godard was making his films supporting them. As a filmmaker, ask yourself would you have boring voiceovers reading tedious political diatribes at your audience, and then, when you could not think of anything else to do, layer another voiceover to the first voiceover, which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case? Brilliant, JeanLuc! As for Godard insisting on making a film with the Rolling Stones of course he did; would not you? It was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place the genius of the Stones eclipsing a talentless and babbling political idiot set loose with a camera. The bookshop scene was not worthy of even the worst fringe theatre, and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it  as could be readily seen. Coppingout by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream filmmaking is no more than a safe getout to offer those who clearly see Godards poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience. Ironic that Godards onetime great friend, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, made the best film about filmmaking ever, and Godard made the worst with Le Mepris!

Our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities, but this does not mean we should not educate ourselves to the highest possible degree. But no doubt this noneducational message ties in with Godards use of rock music; hence The Rolling Stones.The song Sympathy for the Devil, whose creation we witness, and from which the film takes its name, is in fact nothing special. The chord sequence, which is not especially original, was used to much better effect in Led Zeppelins ThankyouLed Zeppelin II. Apart form that, Sir Mick Jagger declaims in his usually nebulous manner rather like Bob Dylan notice how the first melodic phrase is unimaginatively repeated over again to form the verse.Besides the fact that the Black Panthers depicted in this film, do not seem to know what they are fighting for, the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography; a message that in fact undermines the sexual liberation of the 1960s and today  indeed, a message that would belie the behaviour of The Rolling Stones around the time the film was made.No wonder, the DVD came free with The Sunday Times!

So you are warned, if you have not seen the movie yet. This are just my thoughts, why I think the movie fails in the end  pun intended.Acting wise, Rosario Dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger a teenager in other words. The villain guy is good, but loses his evil touch right before the end. If he really never changes, then why would he let a woman tie him up? He would not, period. Then we also have the bartender2nd rape Dude. Actually I do not think you would need him. At least not for the 2nd rape, but more about that later on.Let us reprise the story. Rosarios character is sexually insecure, might even have lesbian tendencies see her scene with a female friend. This was not intentional, as Rosario states herself, but there is sexual tension between them. Rosarios character meets a guy, who is a sexual Predator, in all the bad senses. But he makes an impression on her.Rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before. I beg to differ. Because she acts, as if it is her first boyfriend, which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother. Talking about her mother, heres another problem. After the first rape takes place, Rosarios character does not tell anyone what happened. Seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one, nothing of that gets explored after that. If Rosarios character would not call her mother anymore or would behave strangely, the mother would be worried like crazy. There was so much potential here. Also her female friend We see her at the party, it is obvious there is something going on and boom she is gone.The first rape is almost unbearable to watch. But feels like a pinch, when you compare it to the ending rape, which feels like you are getting hit with a sledge hammer! After rape no. 1 we get too stretched out scenes. Threads are opened such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian, as one guy states who tried to hit on her ..., but left in the open. No real social contact is established, if you leave the bartender guy out, who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene. It is apparent that he is not a nice guy and his character gets fleshed out a bit. But when Rosarios character meets her rapist in class again, his being in the movie seems pointless. We get the point that Rosarios character is not the same anymore, that she went bad and is able to hurt people. Too Many scenes show exactly that, her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff. Back to Rapist 1 who cheats on a test, gets caught by Rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again really?. As absurd as that sounds, the guy meets up with her, not without us having seen him beforehand, with another girl very likely that he raped her too, although we never see anything of that, fortunately and his football career. Well career is a stretch and he is bullied. This is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works, but then again is too clich\u00e9 to stay with you. So Rapist 1 submits to Rosarios character ... why exactly? Because he promised her, it was her day? Again, really? A guy like that never loses control, especially with a woman he raped before ... I guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is. The bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something, but letting him submit like that, just feels wrong. Another possibility would have a drug in his drink.So rapist 1 undresses and gets blindfolded and let us Rosarios character tie him on a bed .... seriously, that is just crazy! But what comes next, is even crazier. First she talks to him, then she shuts him up and forces an object into him. This is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one. This is not about what this guy deserves or not, it is just intense. And of course that was what they were aiming for. Now after she is done the bartender guy comes in and rapes ... rapist 1. If this really should work as a revenge movie, it would have been better if Rosarios character herself would have been doing all the revenge. Having a henchman doing the job, takes away everything that was built up.This is not supposed to be entertainingenjoyable, it is a hard watch  it is Arthouse. But the 10 minute I did not count  rape scene at the end, just smashes everything. Rosarios character is more or less, only watching what happens. Which brings me to the biggest disappointment.Irreversible comparison Irreversible had the rape scene, but the movie went on even if it was back into time. Rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this. First, that comes a bit too late, that should see her say that after the initial rape. And secondly and most importantly, this is where the Arthouse movie should have come in. It is more interesting seeing were Rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope, with what she had done. But then again, she did not actually physically do that much see above ... a broken character that the movie cuts off ...Good intentions Talia and Rosario had worked before, but failing to convey most of the things, they set out to do even if you can see what they meant, it has to be convincing, otherwise it does not work ... not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are ...","label":0},{"index":12432,"txt":"In the 60s, having as the background the rehearsal and recording of Sympathy for the Devil in the classic album Beggars Banquet by the revolutionary bad boy Rolling Stones \u0096 Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman and Brian Jones \u0096 plus Marianne Faithful, Godard discloses other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movements \u0096 the Black Power through the Black Panthers, the feminism, the communism, the fascism  entwined with the reading of a cheap pulp political novel divided in the chapters The Stones Rolling; Outside Black Novel; Sight and Sound; All About Eve; The Heart of Occident; Inside Black Syntax; and, Under the Stones the Beach.Sympathy for the Devil is another pretentious and boring mess of the uneven director JeanLuc Godard.

But the most memorable method they used to get us into the right state of mind was a guest speaker, who was none other than Australian Kickboxings favorite son, Stan The Man Longinidis. The first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone, because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him. Now, his speech was full of the usual if you fail to prepare, then prepare to fail stuff, but there were various instances where I got really worked up. The guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and noone else. He was offered many deals in the past to give up kickboxing, but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming Australias greatest kickboxer. He said that he was not a sellout, he was happy and a retiree, he was not ever involved in any other activity other than Kickboxing\u0085 then he plugged his film. Yes, you heard right, he PLUGGED his new FILM. As he talked about it, he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it, and then he showed this shitty 4 minute clip of this vile film called Trojan Warrior. This all being before he was defeated by Gurkan Ozkan in his final career fight for nowStan plays Ajax, a kickboxing exspecial forces agent that is pulled into the seedy underworld of Melbourne. Ajaxs cousin, Theo Arthur Angel recently sold out well, at least Stan did not stray too far away from EVERYTHING to the feds, and as a result is on the run from all walks of organized crime. Ajax and Theo get into all sorts of ridiculous situations, from fighting in a Kebab shop to posing as playboys at a bondage party. It is all pretty ridiculous, but if Silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible film here, this man should never be handed a camera again. I will admit, I was actually pumped to see this. I love action films, even if they are corny, and especially if it is set in my own backyard. But what I was introduced to was a film with acting that was appalling from the word go, and continued to do so after the words for the love of God please make it stop!, subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open, characters were just thrown in for absolutely NO reason whatsoever, and the most overchoreographed fight scenes that did not even remotely reflect Stans actual talent in Kickboxing. The cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone REMOTELY famous Dermot Brereton, Mark Chopper Read and Greg Matthews. The whole time you are sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background. Too bad the movie relies heavily on splitsecond appearances by former celebrities. Remember those plotholes I told you about? Ajax once upon a time was apparently locked up, wrongly accused for murdering his wife. Now, we hear that Ajax was in special forces via ONE single sentence in the WHOLE film, and then leave it for buggery. This is followed by another SINGLE sentence which persuades Ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up. Then, get this, at the end, it is revealed to Ajax that his wife is not actually dead, but was sold into prostitution. Do we see her? No. Does Ajax go off to find her as soon as he hears this? No. Now That is a marriage! Amidst all this irritatingly puerile crap, some website described this film as \u0085a cross between Jackie Chan  Guy Ritchie\u0085. Has this man ever sat down and watched a Jackie Chan film?! Chan shows more dexterity taking a dump than Stan did doing\u0085, well, ANYTHING! And Guy Ritchie is the crimefilm Messiah, and you are comparing him to Salik Silverstein!? This film is more like a mix between Pizza and Enter The Ninja. Now, where do you thing the whole Trojan Warrior title comes from? Ajaxs fierce fighting skills like that of an Ancient Greek Warrior? No. The gangsters unification to find Theo, like that of the Trojan Empire? No. It is because\u0085 wait for it\u0085 Theo carries a condom around with him.

The funny thing was Chopper just rapped for 30 seconds and then threw it over to these two albino teens from Doncaster, using such words as dis and dope etc in their Australian accents. Face it people, rap was developed in the States, LEAVE IT THERE! The clip looked like something a Channel 31 cameraman on ecstasy put together. \u0095 Bloopers There was no real difference between these and the actual film. \u0095 Stan The Man Longinidis Kickboxing Featurette This was not too bad, considering it was just 6 or 7 different fights shown from different angles I think I saw Dennis Alexio fall over about 15 times in that 3 minute montage.I do not want to say this film contributes to the reason this country is going to hell when it comes to film, but... oh wait, I just did.

Nil by Mouth is an excellent, far more interesting excursion into the lives of individuals in a similar social milieu. Ditto for In the Warzone. And although the comparison is not even warranted, check out anything by Peter Greenaway, who far more deftly handles dialogue, wit and absurd characters and situations.","label":0},{"index":12446,"txt":"I really must watch a good movie soon, because it seems every other entry or so is something that I despise.

Occasionally this story is done well and realistically as in The Theory of Flight, an excellent weepie, but more frequently it is done like it is here, where as usual the heroine dies of Old Movie Disease. You know, the terminal illness that has no symptoms but one fainting spell and a need to lie down as you are telling your lover goodbye forever; and your looks are not affected one bit and since this is the 70s, neither is your sex life. This is one of the worst versions made of that particular story, where a very silly script puts two incompatible and unbelievable characters together, and they are played by actors who are completely at sea.This has got to be the worst performance of Al Pacinos career, and I say that after having seen The Devils Advocate only two days ago! He plays a controlfreak, emotionally constipated racecar driver, and plays an unlikeable character lifelessly. He seems to constantly be asking himself why he is staying around the grating Marthe Keller so does the audience, and spends most of the movie just... standing there, usually with his mouth hanging open. The only time he shows any sign of life is towards the end, where his character proves that he is changed from uptight to liberated by doing a hilariously bad Mae West imitation. Hey, it was the seventies!Marthe Keller is equally terrible as the dying love interest; her character was conceived as bold and free and touching and uninhibited and full of life even though dying, and was probably meant to be played with an actress with the sensitivity of, say, Vanessa Redgrave or Julie Christie. Instead, they got the expressionless face and heavy German accent of Ms. Keller, who comes across as more of a scary Teutonic stereotype You VILL eat ze omelet! than anything like lovable. She is supposed to be reforming Pacino and filling him with courage and spirit and all that, but it does not work that way, it is more like she is harping on his faults in the most obnoxious possible fashion. This makes for one of the least convincing romances in movie history, where you cannot believe she would be with someone she finds so worthless, and you cannot believe he is with someone who gets on his nerves that much.Some badmovie fans call this a cult classic, mostly because of Pacinos silly liberating Mae West imitation. The scene is a scream, especially in context, but not worth sitting through the rest of the film for. No, only see the film if you are a serious badmovie aficionado who is especially interested in studying Extreme Lack of Chemistry between leading actors, or Very Bad Casting not only are the leads terrible, but Pacinos other girlfriend is played by an actress who looks and sounds just likes Keller with shorter hair, I got them totally confused.

In the book, Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor the Presentational approach, and the Representational approach. In the Presentational approach, the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible, by introducing emotional elements from the actors own life. In the Representational approach, the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion, through a high degree of control of movement and sound.The Representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this Hamlet was made. British theater has a long history of this style of acting, and Olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the Representational school.Time has not been kind to this school of acting, or to this movie. Nearly every working actor today uses a Presentational approach. To the modern eye, Oliviers highly enunciated, stylized delivery is stodgy, stiff and stilted. Instead of creating an internally conflicted Hamlet, Olivier made a declaiming, selfimportant bullhorn out of the melancholy Dane  an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger London theaters, but is far too starchy to carry off a modern Hamlet.And so the movie creaks along ungainfully today. Oliviers tendency to enunciate makes some of Hamlet us lines unintentionally funny Instead, you must acquire and beget a tempurrance that may give it... Smoothness! Instead of crying at meeting his fathers ghost as any proper actor could, bright fill lights in Oliviers pupils give us that impression.Eileen Herlie is the only other actor of note in this Hamlet, putting in a good essay at the Queen, despite the painfully obvious age differences he was 41; she was 26. The other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done, given Oliviers tendency to want to keep! the camera! on him! at all! times! Sixty years later, you feel the insecurity of the Shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable, flawed Hamlet, and instead elected to portray a sort of Elizabethan bullhorn.

By the time we get to the finale, our interest has already waned.One point of success that Dawson does point out in the QA is that by the end revenge scene we are pumped for retribution, then realize just how drawnout and ugly the reality is. While that is certainly valid, it does not make the scene any more intriguing.If you have the DVD, check out the deleted classroom scene. This is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation though all verbal and really DOES show Dawsons slow crackup materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor Francie Swifts prissy, condescending dorm counselor. If more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down, we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence.As the film stands in the final cut, though, all we get is what we have seen before, only in a more graphic rendering.

This is somebody I have never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face, and I can see why. She had one of the most artificial performances I have ever seen for a leading character in any movie, A or B. I figured okay, maybe she did not really want the role, just got a hefty offer for a movie she was not into? Wrong. She was listed as one of the producers. Next time you produce something, do not book yourself as the lead if you cannot act. If you really can, then create a decent character for you to become.

The film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrences, or delights as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me. The plot is not really worth commenting as, but basically a plane carrying football players crashes into Yeti territory. Before the movie is over, we are treated to yetis ripping hearts out, yetis waddling in an effort to run before jumping 50 meters, yetis ripping a mans legs off and beating him with them, a woman killing a rabbit at 30 meters with a javelin, a yeti surviving several bullets and being set on fire with no apparent harm, a yeti dangling off a cliff by holding to a mans shoe, yet then jumps off, and a whole collection of further, bizarre occurrences. Basically, if you are not staying up on a Saturday for the expressed purpose of watching the worst of SciFi channel original movies, avoid this film like the plague.

I find it totally enjoyable in spite of the poor production quality. The acting herein is about as abominable as the monster stalking them, although the monster itself is quite well done...impressively well done, at that. He actually looks kind of otherworldly, like an alien family on vacation landed in the Himalayas and while dad was out taking a ... attending to natures call, Spot got loose and they just did not have time to hunt him down. That, or he is the Caucasian brother of the Wishmaster. I have not decided which.Actually, this seems to have been filmed somewhere in snow country, yes, but more likely Canada somewhere than China anywhere. The trees and vistas say Canada to me, and it is okay that the set area never takes on the look or feel of ubercoldness one might expect to find in the Himalayas of China. It is a SciFi Channel movie, so we can forgive the lack of location.Further, apparently as we have just established SciFi directors do not travel often, as they are not aware that commercial planes fly above weather like what is featured herein and the subsequent crash actually would not have happened. But as I said, it is a SciFi Channel movie so we must forgive a few things.The movie is pretty graphic at times, and rotates between Alive about the Donner Party, Predator about the alien in the woods, and any bad wushu movie where they fly about on wires. The Yeti apparently can leap about like Spiderman...or Super Mario...remember? Run faster! Jump higher! Live longer! Also, the Yeti has missed his teddy bear. He is searched high and low for it, but cannot seem to make a cadaver work. Poor Yeti! You cannot help but feel sorry for it. It has survived and evolved thousands of years only to succumb to severe teddy bear loss. He is missed his bear. Or maybe it wants to mate, but that thought is BANISHED! Do ya hear me? Well, it does seem to be an unmated male. REBANISHED! And it is superhuman. Well, it is not human...it is superYeti! But then again, what is normalYeti? I do not know, but he has a definite Michael Meyers quality that is completely unsettling. And he is got this fabulous way of cleaning his fur. FABulous Dahlink! It is spotlessly white at times when it SO should not be. He is fastidiously superhu...superYeti.All in all? This was a lot of fun to watch, has some great kills and a few honest plot elements. In spite of the horribly gravellike production style, this is actually quite entertaining. I cannot help wondering if they are planning on another one?

Fire seemed to be a predominate theme throughout. They searched corpses for lighters and matches, and finally finding a box built a fire every day for, apparently, 12, but no one ever gathered wood.

Unlucky really. With some dead  some alive the survivors have to think about themselves  decide to wait it out until help comes. However just when they think their luck could not get any worse they soon discover that a huge, hairy Yeti type Abominable Snowman creature wants to kill  eat them all. Trapped, cold, starving  fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time?Yeah, with a title like Yeti Curse of the Snow Demon it can only mean one thing  that is that someone at the SciFi Channel has made yet another Creature Feature although to give these things a bit of variety the SciFi Channel here in the UK are now dubbing them as a Beast Feast! As if that will make any difference. Directed by Paul Ziller one has to say that Yeti Curse of the Snow Deamon is a terrible film but a somewhat entertaining one at the same time, sure it is bad but it is sort of fun at times too. The basic premise is alright actually, it is a sort of cross between Alive 1993 with it is plane crash  the survivors having to turn cannibal to survive  the excellent gory killer Bigfoot another legendary hairy monster exploitation flick Night of the Demon 1980 which I would defend with my last breath  I have to say it is not exactly a marriage made in heaven but as I said it is fun at times if not exactly gripping or well written. The characters are mostly annoying American teens, there is the expected arguing, there is the macho hero, the strong female  the coward who thinks only of himself so there is no prizes for originality. There are some plot holes too, if a plane load of people crash why only send two rangers on foot to search for them? How are you going to dig a large hole  line it with sharpened sticks in the space of ten minutes? Why did the Yeti not kill that bird at the end? It had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her? The there are actually two Yetis running around twist is not used to any effect at all either. At least there is a good pace about the film, it certainly moves along at a fair old pace  I never found myself becoming bored with it. There is some moderately gory action  the film does have some fascination in seeing whether the kids are going to survive or not  if they are going to eat their dead mates or not.The one thing you can always say about these SciFi Channel Creature Features or Beast Feasts is that the CGI computer effects will be laugh out loud hilarious  so that proves to be the case yet again. The plane crash at the start looks awful  the Yeti when it is CGI looks simply embarrassing jumping all over the place like it is on a pogo stick. There one or two nice gore scenes including a ripped off arm, a squashed head, a ripped out heart, some dead bodies, some blood splatter  the best bit when the Yeti rips a guy in half  beats him with his own rippedoff legs before biting a big chunk out of them. According to the IMDb the actor playing the Yeti took three  a half hours to get into the suit  the makeup which seems like a long time since it is actually a pretty tatty looking creation. Apparently the original title was Raksha Curse of the Snow Demon with Raksha meaning demon in Tibetan Sanskrit, so now you know.This has reasonable production values considering the usual SciFi Channel stuff they churn out although the mountain location looks nothing like the harsh, bleak Himalayas  was probably situated near some ski resort somewhere  during a lot of the daytime scenes it actually looks pleasantly warm. The acting is not that good  I did not think any of the girls looked that good either which did not help.Yeti Curse of the Snow Demon is another terrible ScFi Channel Creature Feature if I am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this is not too bad  there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if it is not very good.","label":0},{"index":12491,"txt":"Hmmm, a sports team is in a plane crash, gets stranded on a snowy mountain, and is faced with the difficult decision to eat the flesh of their dead companions in order to survive.
