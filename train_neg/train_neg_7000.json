I cannot spoil the ending, because I have absolutely no idea what happened. I will try my best, though. There are some kind of lesbian vampires, but they keep swapping bodies, so any character might or might not be the character you are supposed to think it is, or it might be a lesbian vampire. Sound confusing? It is not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters make any sense to begin with. There is no plot, no character development, and random people show up, speak a few lines, and then disappear, never to be heard from again. There are also zombies, who are possibly the enemies of the vampires, but there is also a dreamwithinadream kind of sequence in a mental hospital, so maybe none of this actually happened, and it is all the main characters hallucination. The upside? Both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly. The special effects are simply mindboggling I particularly liked the incredibly slow, awkward fight sequences. Everyone has a really silly Canadian accent, which adds to the general level of hilarity. Well worth the price of rental. We laughed until we cried.","label":0},{"index":6002,"txt":"First off I must stress how rare it is that I take the time to comment on a movie that I have seen, it takes a very special case for me to take the time and write about how I felt about a film. That said, of the hundreds of movies I have watched I have seen some of the most brilliant, Shawshank, the scariest, The Woman in Black, the funniest, Shark Attack III Megaladon, and now the worst Vampires vs. Zombies.The first thing that must be said is that this movie is not funny! For those that are looking for a light hearted movie that will just be fun or at the very least so bad that it is funny, look elsewhere. It is true that a movie such as this is not trying to be subtle and brilliant, with a title such as this you should know what you are getting into. That said, there is no excuse for a movie to abandon any and every rule that governs the movie making world. This is not an argument between the traditional movie making process and newer and more artsy methods to creating a film, this is an argument between bad directors and companies being held accountable for making terrible movies.This movie suffers from the over used saying I do not know where to start. Truly everything about this movie is broken. From the acting and to the editing there is no reason any movie should ever fail to deliver a cohesive series of events such as Vampires vs. Zombies. Some of the following problems are; 1. Scene misfires It is clear that the director, the camera crew and the actors were not on the same page. In one scene in particular the scene begins with the camera resting on the ground looking at the passenger side door of a car. You are expecting the person inside to get out, but there is a, and this is NO exaggeration, 10 second, at least, delay between the camera comes on and the director says action to where anything happens on screen. The viewer is left staring at a car door for the entire time with no sound, no movement, just the stereotypical dead air that radio or TV commentators dread. Where was the editing? 2. Acting A forgivable offense in most cases, you cannot expect a movie like this to have Oscar winners after all, but Vampires vs. Zombies takes bad acting to a whole other level. These actors were barely able to read their scripts obviously because anyone with any ability to read and to speak would have been able to pronounce the lines better than these fools. My only comparison for acting would have to be the opening scene from Resident Evil on Playstation. But that acting was even better.3 Story Wait, what? Story? Again you cannot expect this to be The Greatest Story Ever Told, but is it too much to ask that we have some semblance of a narrative? Why the Vampires? Who are the characters? Who are the bad guys? Are there good guys? Why all the lesbians? But most importantly, what is the deal with the zombies? If you have seen this movie then you will understand what I mean, but to those who have not I will be plain, there are no zombies in this movie aside from maybe five minutes of it. It was almost as if the director forgot about the name of the movie and was forced to throw some zombies in without explanation at the very end.There is so much more, but I hope I have done enough to keep anyone from seeing this movie.","label":0},{"index":6003,"txt":"I really have no idea how to comment on this movie. The special effects were lackluster, the acting was terrible and if there was a plot to it all, it was on the back of the box. I do not think I can remember a movie being THIS bad in a long time, and I am a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies!! ; Even that could not save this movie from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand or lay in this case in front of a camera.I was pretty much let down by the overall zombie effect. Since apparently in this movie, zombies are so commonplace that running over a couple here and there, and casually talking about it at a gas station one with an inhouse windshield repair but no interior bathroom, the zombiemovie genre is not even a factor until the end. Even then, a cameo by a dozen zombies ripping off a girls clothes does not really constitute being a zombie movie.On to the vampires Apparently all the zombies are male and all the vampires are female, which is OK by me. I am not sure how vampires are out in the daylight, or the whyhow of a soldier vampire came to be standing in the middle of the road, still holding his gun with a stake through his heart, just waiting for the Queen of the Vampires to flick it all the way through. The last segment in the old nunnery made no sense, and when one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire Do you think we did the right thing? by killing the two apparent heroes in the movie, that about put it over the top.The acting and special effects were at an alltime low also. You could almost see the hoses that the fake blood was pumped out of during the closeup of the zombie who got ran over by the General. Speaking of the General, where did they find THIS Kenny Rogers lookalike anyways? No idea what he was the General of, aside of generally confusing and misplaced.All in all, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong urge to waste 3.

In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other ONCE OR TWICE. On top of that, we are never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to tone it down or make it realistic, but it ends up just boring. More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR. The scenes that take place anywhere else are not much to brag about, either. Also, there is no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. However, I will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere. I am all for independent films, but it does not look like this was ever intended for a mass audience if any. worse than Scarecrow slayer.","label":0},{"index":6007,"txt":"The above seemed a much more appropriate title when me and my suicidal underlings decided to watch this masterpiece of modern bullshit Erotic,Scary, Suspenseful, Well thought out, these are all the things this film fails to be.It is however incredibly funny, the slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to this to make one of the greatest comedies I have seen in recent years. And yet this film does not even try to be funny and that is one of the movies grand achievements, it becomes a comedy without even attempting to amuse.Throughout the film an old guy who looks amazingly like Santa Claus goes around ploughing over zombies and smashing vampires into the ground. This made me fail to believe the films title, if this was vampires vs zombies why were the vampires and zombies not fighting? Oh well whatever, besides there were more flaws to this rental than the title. Such as this one; there has been a virus sweeping through America creating zombie like beings who go around acting a lot like your average tourist. And yet there is only four zombies in the entire film. Another problem is besides one shop everywhere is deserted. Surely you would see zombies roaming about in the woods or in the background a bit. In fact I believe they just drove around in a circle of forest over and over again since they did not have a high enough budget to film in a wider location, that or the director did not want to waste his precious time filming in different areas of wood he was to busy sitting in a trailer jerking off to be bothered with such trivial matters.In fact the director had so much fun doing this that he did not have enough time to hire a big enough cast or even an editor. And so he told the eight members of the cast to dress up as different people and try not to act inconspicuous, whilst I assume he changed his name and began randomly snipping at the film reels editing is not a hard job anyway right? The only reason this movie found it is way into our bag was because somehow we got it confused with Freddy vs Jason, strange how these things happen is not it.

Bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it. The plot, and I use that term loosely, involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with the general, whose daughter is missing, at a church to kill a vampire who, very conveniently, happens to be traveling with the father and daughter.

And this Hive ripoff has a series of traps that inevitably kill off one member of the squad at a time. There is even a chess reference in the code names, which was in the dialog of RE. Despite the fact that there are no zombies, the Rook, the movies nemesis, is some sort of biocreature, very pail in color suggesting necrotic tissue, with a lot of cyborg components just like a super mutant of RE.

There are plot holes in every corner, the dialogue borders on the ridiculous, and the ending is telegraphed a mile away.

Apparently this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tubed wonder armor has no access to MREs.

It seems that the All Knowing Big Boss is the last person on Earth that knows that these spores even exist. The spores are located far away from any living soul, and they are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. The All Knowing Big Boss wants the secret spores to remain in their secret protected containers. So, he makes a plan to send in a macho action team to remove the spore containers from all of the protective systems and secret location. Sending people to the location of secret spores makes them no longer a secret. Sending people to disable all of the protective systems makes it possible for the spores to be easily released into the air. How about letting sleeping dogs lie?! The one pleasant feature of ENCRYPT is the radiant and elegant Vivian Wu.

A very good commercial, a director like Paul Verhoeven and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, plus a very interesting theme  invisibility. Every premise for a great movie was accomplished. Unfortunately these things did not matter at all. The movie was very very week, without suspense and awfully predictable. It is all about a bunch of scientists who discovered invisibility. After the tests on animals succeeded, Kevin Bacon decides to test it on himself. Once he is invisible, he changes completely, realizing the advantages of not being seen. From this to murder there is a very thin line.Hollow Man is an ill movie. It suffers of the disease that many new movies have the special effects. From a challenging theme that could have lead the producers to a great tensed psychological thriller, Verhoeven ruins everything focusing only on special effects, without giving a damn about the real value of the movie. I must admit, the fx are awesome, probably the best i have seen since Matrix, but that is not enough to make a movie good. Actually that is the problem with the movies today. Just like Verhoeven, most directors care only about spectacular scenes  and nothing more. The exceptions are very few, and probably the Matrix is the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plot.After Starship Troopers, Verhoeven disappoints again. In stead of a great film, HM is crp. There are only 2 reasons why you could watch this movie 1. the special effects 2. the joke with Superman and Wonder Woman i will not spoil this moment for you...Okay, so what went wrong with the movie? Everything. Let us see what i can remember. It is not tensed at all. It should have been, but it is not. It is too predictable . You know from the beginning who will die and who will live. In stead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven cares only about the effects. Very many cliches.  Of course the bad guy wakes up a few times before dying. Just like in every low quality horror, the first rule is to let the characters separate as much as possible. Every time there is somebody alone in the lab, perfect victim for Bacon. Some holes in the plot. Example at the beginning, Bacon has to scan his finger to enter the lab. After he is invisible, how can he do that? The ending absolutely horrible. After Shue hits Bacon in the head, Bacon falls down to the ground. Then Shue and Brolin leave quietly and slowly, without looking back. Is that normal? Then Bacon gets up, attacks them, they kill him again. And then Shue screams I heard an explosion happened minutes ago, and they suddenly run inside. Did not she hear that explosion some time before? There is a scene in which you can see the microphones hanging above the actors. Come on, Mr Verhoeven , i expected much more from you!So that is about Hollow Man.

Vampires in space is not exactly a new formula, and even after so many movies dealing with these monsters in this particular setting, still no one seems to realize it is an incredibly stupid premise that cannot possibly result in a halfway decent horror movie. Bloodsuckers even goes one step further and shamelessly imitates every imaginable motion picture that either revolves on vampires and intergalactic warfare. The plot and characters are mainly stolen directly from John Carpenters Ghosts of Mars and James Camerons Aliens, as a crew of futuristic vampire hunters are crusading through space and regularly holding to eliminate a mutated species that peculiarly named themselves after notorious horror icons, like the Voorhees and the Leatherfaces. The good guys are a bunch of pathetic stereotypes, constantly dealing with clich\u00e9d issues and endlessly arguing about dreadfully unimportant matters. Captain Damian is the unpopular rookie, who will really have to prove his leadership capabilities now after being more or less responsible for the death of the previous and far more loved Captain Churchill. The other annoying characters include a typical cowboystyle and trigger happy macho pilot, a tough female warrior with more balls than any of the males on board she is of Asian descent, like the girl in Aliens was Latino and the armys most valuable secret weapon a Bladegirl!

They eventually all learn to work as a team when forced to face the ultimate vampiremeanie Michael Ironside in yet another downgrading role. Bloodsuckers is an irredeemably stupid film, but it manages to entertain as long as it features gory killings, infantile dialogs and OTT makeup effects.

Also this film commits one of the major B movie sins, it teases a lesbian scene, and does not deliver. Most of all what sinks this film is nothing really happens. Since it was meant to be a pilot the script is almost nonexistent and it does not have a regular ending. Even the main villains, only come in towards the end. If ever a movie needed to up the Sleaze and gore factor, it is Vampire Wars.

Well, the only thing unpredictable about the ending was when suddenly the tomboy becomes a lesbian and starts to do it with the female vampire, which, by the way, is not really all that hot considering it occurs for about three seconds, in which you are closer to What the hell? then Man, that is hot.

The VSAN Vampire Sanitation Squad, which also has their own spaceship and is lead by Churchill, who is captured by the vampires, receives a message from an Earth and the team, formed by Quintana Played by the very hot Natassia Malthe, the rookie officer Damian and the rebels Rosa and Roman Roman being played by Aaron Pearl from Wrongfully Accused.

The best I can say for this film is it has a good cast of blist and upcoming stars. Natassia Malthe was Quintana, and was far more attractive here than in Bloodrayne 2. Michael Ironside is Muco, and is always a fan favorite as I say, he is the poor mans Jack Nicholson. And we even get CarrieAnn Fleming as Damians wife, who horror fans will now recognize as the eponymous Jenifer from Dario Argentos Jenifer. So this movie, as bad as it is, is not without some names attached... but the same can be said of Uwe Bolls work.The concept of the military tracking and killing vampires in space is not necessarily a bad idea, but it easily falls into the realm of cheese and this film falls hard. The acting, especially from the vampires, is over the top and I just did not find the explanations of their existence very convincing. Worst of all, the vampire tribes have the names Voorhess and Leatherfaces. I understand this was supposed to be a clever reference for the horror fans, but it was not clever at all. It just sounded dumb and out of place unlike the much more subtle references in James Gunns Slither, such as naming stores after lesserknown horror directors.That is all I want to say.

When large sections of an audience are laughing and groaning during and after a serious thriller, its clear that the film is hopeless.Not only that, it was sick too. The director took the action beyond the bounds of realistic fare for a violent film, and into the realms of an over the top blood soaked Bmovie. It is difficult not to imagine the director as some sort of dirty old man, because the extent of the invisible mans forays out of the lab and into the outside world extended only to two attempts at having a feel of some breasts. Perhaps sex could well be the first thing on a blokes mind if made invisible, but aside from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved, it hardly makes entertaining cinema.spoilers followGet past the films sick exterior, and things are even worse. Whilst Kevin Bacon does a good job of acting increasingly twisted as hollow man, the rest of them  perhaps handicapped by a dire script  do an even better job of being hollow cast. One long time member of the team is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man, He is finally snapped shrugs one colleague without a hint of emotion. This is par for the course, and the lab team swing between sheer terror and complete indifference with such speed that you wonder how they got into acting. They pad their way through the lab corridors terrified, guns poised, but then seconds later one of the crew skips happily off back down the corridor to get blood for a hurt colleague. The lead female treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humour even after he is insulted and abused her, and there seems to be little reaction to his breakouts, even after he drowns the Pentagon chief, He drowned in his pool last night reports the same female, spectacularly failing to put two and two together.The script is littered with this kind of badly acted pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just an AZ of film cliches, which get laid on thicker and faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and amusement at the end.The eureka moment at the computer, the female undressing at the window, the looped security video  the list really is endless  the predictable disregard for strength in numbers, the decision not to kill the two main stars but just put them in a place of probable impending death and leave them to their own devices, the almostdead good guy appearing out of nothing to save the woman, the bomb and ubiquitous countdown timer, the fireball explosion which just burns up before reaching the heroes, the falling lift which just stops before hitting them, and more than anything else, the immortality of the bad guy.The invisible man is burnt to a shred with a makeshift flamethrower, electrocuted, whacked round the head with a bar which had just sliced straight through one of the lesser actors, and then having apparently survived the explosion, fireball and total destruction of the labs, has more than enough life left to climb up through the fireball for one last pop at the films heroes  by which stage the disbelieving audience are cringing and looking at their watches.That this exceptionally bad film actually made it to the cinema is astounding. Even the name of the film is as hopeless as the movie itself, and not even impressive special effects come anywhere near saving this one, which should be avoided at all costs.","label":0},{"index":6033,"txt":"I picked this movie up to replace the dismal choice of daytime television and to go with my thirst for femme fatales.

The plot set up of a crew of vampire hunters VSan, for vampire sanitation, going around in their spaceship periodically killing space vamps and rescuing people, is quite sound and had the film been handled better it might well have been something quite ace. Unfortunately after a fairly decent opening the sense of actual quality starts to drain away from the film, leaving something behind that, though vacantly watchable, is quite laughably bad. I do not expect anything too special from these films that pop up on the Sci Fi Channel and at least this was not one of their creature features with an atrocious cgi beast shambling about, but it was still pretty bad, mostly due to the writing and acting, but with a sterling contribution to the overall badness made by the horrible music. When the film opted just for a typical science fiction sounding weird noises approach to the soundtrack it did OK, but all too often hilariously bad soft rock intruded and pitched scenes into silliness. I would have tolerated the general cheesy acting and writing more were it not for the choice of music, which was a serious miscalculation, turning things from cheesy to lamely comical. Of the acting, Dominic Zamprogna was OK but bland as the nominal hero, whilst Leanne Adachi was pretty irritating as the tough girl of the vamp busting team and Aaron Pearl played another member who was not well written or interesting enough to make an impression. Though she did not seem that good at the acting lark Natassia Malte did well through having a less irritating character than the others, and the fact that she is seriously nice to look at. The only serious name in the cast is Michael Ironside and he is underused though he does nicely, pretty amusing in a manner one suspects was intentional. He seems to have fun and earn his paycheck and his role is entertaining. The effects are OK on the whole, they are at least of the standards of the average science fiction TV show, and there are also a few scenes of blood splatter and a bit of fun gore as well. Things move along nicely, and I almost feel harsh rating this film badly, but then I remember bursting into laughter at regular intervals and realising that unless the film is an intentional comedy, which I do not think it is, then it simply does not succeed. Too much is lame, daft, unconvincing, its an OK effort I guess but it did not appeal to me.

However, I had thought that I had seen all the possible lows that the SciFi Channel could hit. Then I saw this movie.Imagine a hand inside a rubberized sock that is glazed with syrup? Those are the main Alien Vampires in this movie. You can clearly see the fingers inside the rubbery sock puppets. A talking hand comes out of the guts of victims, and the Vampire who is on the Vampire Hunters team can talk to these Rubber Sock puppets in Transylvanian. How did Alien Vampires learn Transylvanian? And is not Transylvania in Romania? So should not they be talking Romanian? Why would some little town have their own language? If you can suspend your gag reflex and get past the talking rubber socks with the fingers clearly moving inside the Aliens heads; then you have to deal with the other alien vampires. There are the Leatherfaces who like to wear the faces of their victims. Then there are the just plain ugly ones that all seem to have a lot of facial scars. Then there are the annoying Valley Girls and their boyfriends who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies so that they can sabotage the Defense Systems so that these Space Vampires can attack.Finally, if you think all of the above is funny and worth a laugh, you have to deal with the third rate cast of Network TV rejects that make up this team of stereotypical angry heroes which are constantly fighting among themselves.

Even the idea of the universe being full of various different breeds of vampire, all with different attributes, many of which the characters have yet to find out about, is kind of cool as well. As to how most of the life in the galaxy outside of earth is vampire, I am not sure how the makers meant for that to work, given the nature of vampires. Who the hell they are meant to be feeding on if almost everyone is a vampire I do not know. As it is the movie comes across a low budget mix of FireflySerenity and vampires movies with a dash of Aliens.The action parts of the movie are pretty average and derivative Particularly of Serenity but passable they are reasonably well executed and there is enough gore for a vampire flick, including some of the comical bloodspurting variety. There is a lot of character stuff, most of which is tedious, coming from conflicts between characters who mostly seem like whiny, immature arseholes primarily cowboy dude and Asian woman. There are a few character scenes that actually kind of work and the actors do not play it too badly but it mostly slows things down. A nice try at fleshing the characters out but people do not watch a movie called Bloodsuckers for character development and drama. The acting is actually okay. Michael Ironside hams it up and is as fun to watch as ever and at least of a couple of the women are hot. The space SFX are not too bad for what is clearly a low budget work. The story is again pretty average and derivative but as I said the world created has a little bit of potential. The way things are set up Bloodsuckers really does seem like the pilot for a TV series character dynamics introduced, the world introduced but not explored, etc. The film does have a some highlights and head scratching moments the kind of stuff that actually makes these dodgy productions watchable. The scene where our heroes interrogate a talking sock puppet chestburster type creature. Hilarious.  The sex scene. WTF indeed. The credit And Michael Ironside as Muco. The most annoying aspect of it all though is the really awful and usually inappropriate pop music they have playing very loud over half the scenes of the movie.

A silly narrative remains as such despite the iconic legacy of Neal Young. The most childish scene is the one where the devil dances his way into a bar, slips a tonic to an unsuspecting hero, who then finds his way onto the dance floor to mouth the words to Young song to the heroine, who is unaware of what is taken place.

Not the best way to craft a story. No character really has an arc, and when significant events do happen, the viewer does not cared, because film technique annoyance levels are so high by that point. The film is all song, and to that end, the characters on end mouth the lyrics as they are sung...the technique works for the first stanza it is done, and is grating on the nerves after that. It does not feel real or fake, it just feels unwelcome.Terrible acting, with characters finding one mood and playing all of it. Poor lighting at times.

It is obvious that the money is the key issue here the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough, and as a result, Hollow Man is seriously undermined with clich\u00e9s, sappy characters, predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever.However, the one thing that actually impressed me, beside the special effects, was the swearing. When making this kind of film, modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them. Therefore, the language and, sometimes, the violence and sex is very toned down. When the whole world blows up, the good guys go Oh darn! and Oh my God. Hollow Man gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them.

It is quite literally a movie that keeps smashing into itself, just as the cars in the cars in the demolition scenes run into each other.The only real interest for me was watching Jane Fonda. Her Iris Caine is supposed to be a light hearted version of her dramatic Bree Daniels prostitute character in Klute Yet, one does not believe her for a moment. It is always Jane Fonda pretending to be a prostitute that we are watching. It is as terrible a performance as her performance in Klute was terrific. It would be a good lesson for acting teachers to run the two films together to show how the same actress in the same type of role can be great or pathetic. It suggests that actors are only as good as their writers and directors.","label":0},{"index":6050,"txt":"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.

It was shown shortly after the magisterial 1935 Silly Symphony cartoon where the Isle of Symphony is reconciled with the Isle of Jazz. What with the recently deceased Ruben Gonzalez piped through speakers in this old cinemaballroom and a Cuban flag hanging from peeling stucco rocaille motifs, the scene was set for a riproaring celebration of engaged filmmaking and synchronised hissing at the idiocies of HelmsBurton. But then the film started. And the cinemas peeling paint gradually became more interesting than the shoddy mess onscreen.The storyline of Nada Mas promises much. Carla is a bored envelopestamper at a Cuban post office. Her only escape from an altogether humdrum existence is to purloin letters and rewrite them, transforming basic interpersonal grunts into Bront\u00eban outbursts of breathless emotion. Cue numerous shots of photogenic Cubans gushing with joy, grief, pity, terror and the like.The problem is that the simplicity of the narrative is marred by endless excursions into filmschool artiness, latino caricature, Marx brothers slapstick and even  during a particularly underwhelming editing trick  the celluloid scratching of a schoolkid defacement onto a characters face.Unidimensional characters abound. Cunda, the boss at the post office, is a humourless dominatrixnosferatu. Her bosseyed accomplice, Concha, variously points fingers, eavesdrops and screeches. Cesar, the metalhead dolt and romantic interest, reveals hidden writing talent when Carla departs for Miami. A chase scene in ohsohilarious fastforward is thrown in for good measure. All this would be fine in a Mortadello and Filemon comic strip, but in a blackandwhite zeroFX flick with highbrow pretensions, ahem.Nada Mas attempts to straddle the stile somewhere between the quirkyheroinematchmakesstrangers of Amelie and the poetryasgreatredeemer theme of Il Postino. Like Amelie, its protagonist is an eccentric single white female who combats impending spinsterdom by trying to bring magic into the lives of strangers. And like Il Postino, the film does not flinch from sustained recitals of poetry and a postman on a bicycle takes a romantic lead. Unfortunately, Nada Mas fails to capture the lushness and transcendence of either film.There are two things that might merit watching this film in a latenight TV stupor. The first is the opening overhead shot of Carla on a checkertiled floor, which cuts to the crossword puzzle she is working on. The second is to see Nada Mas as a cautionary example our post Buena Vista Social Club obsession with Cuban artistic output can often blinker us into accepting any dross that features a bongo on the soundtrack. This film should not have merited a global release  films such as Waiting List and Guantanamera cover similar thematic territory far more successfully.","label":0},{"index":6053,"txt":"Very poor effort that offers pretty much nothing to anyone but a hardcore fan of Stanley Tucci, who tries, but can not save the poor structure, dialogue, direction, or talent of our leading man.Pretty much the only trick this plodding tale of a naive new salesman for an alarm company has, is its quirky side characters.

Go ahead, take a look at the film, you will be shocked that it was made in 1933, it was the first true special effects movie. Come 2000, computer aided special effects seem like childs play, audiences are not blown away by special effects, instead they are disappointed if they are not done right. The special effects in Hollow Man, the update of the HG Wells story, are OK, but not the biggest problem with this film directed by Paul Verhoeven, who you might remember from Showgirls and Total Recall. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist dabbling in the world of bioinvisibilation yeah, I know that is not a word but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the teams funding. So, as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do, he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation yeah, I know, I used that nonword again process. The process has dire consequences, no Caine does not die, but instead becomes a horny, violent creature, aka a guy. Now that he is invisible, Caine stalks a sexy neighbor, a coworker, former girlfriend Linda Elisabeth Shue, and the man who took away his funding. Then a funny thing happens, Caine becomes a new supernatural being, The Thing That Will not Die. Laughing in the face of all things natural, Caine faces down death and spits in it is face, as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die, dragging the ending of the movie out. The movie is silly, stupid, and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used, sometimes not. There are neat possibilities in Hollow Man, but of course, not one of them is explored. For a more interesting look at an invisible being, get ready for some good oldfashioned black and white cinema, and check out the 1933 Invisible Man. Kevin Bacon will still be invisible when you come back, probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano.","label":0},{"index":6055,"txt":"How can you tell that a horror movie is terrible? when you cannot stop laughing about it of course!

Where exactly does this take place, seems to be a mystery. The cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa banging the drums... the Devil God is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyes.One of the freakiest moments in the film is when, Pablito find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that I assume is blood, starts screaming for minutes on and on that is actually funny, and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and Pablito kicks it a bit for what I assume is shits n giggles and the eyes actually move...But, of course, then the freak is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just bad...I had not laughed like this in a loooong while, and I definitely recommend this film for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do... grab a case of beers and start watching this film, you will love it!

David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci try mightily to make this train wreck watchable, but some things are just not humanly possible.What, for instance, causes Gale to turn suddenly from a sweet motherly figure into a drunken shrew at Tommys parents house? Why would Heinrich, although admittedly a sleezebag, want to destroy the business to which he devotes his life, by robbing and possibly murdering his customers? Why does the seemingly sensible Tommy believe that Heinrich could be a murderer based almost entirely on a dream, and even if that were believable, why would not he go to the police? And why did not Gale activate the alarm when she got home, especially after scolding Howie about it being off? Of course, all of these events are necessary for the plot and I use the term very, very loosely to unfold. And it might be forgivable if it resulted in even the slightest bit of comedy. But everything, from Howies description of his date rape, to the coroners misidentification of Gale, to the final joke about Gale and Howie still being dead, is more tasteless and pathetic than anything else.I checked the box indicating that my comments contained spoilers, but there is nothing more I or anyone else could do to spoil this thing that already stinks to high heaven.","label":0},{"index":6060,"txt":"David Arquette is a young and naive home security alarmsalesman taken under the wing of Stanley Tucci.

Arquette decides not to getinvolved, taking Capshaw to meet his family, and going through lifewith a goofy smile on his face. Then, someone breaks intoCapshaws home and murders her and her son. Arquette suspects Tucci, and sets a series of traps, resulting in a gun to hisboss head as Tucci pleads his innocence.Based on a stage play, The Alarmist is not opened up well. Thescenes where Arquette takes the Capshaw to meet his parentsare badly played and completely unfunny. They are also out of linewith the character Capshaw is playing, as she gets drunk and tellssexually explicit stories to Arquettes mom Michael Learned. Otherthan these scenes, Capshaw is not given much to do, but shedoes a lot with the little she is given.Stanley Tucci, looking just like Terry OQuinn, is a riot as thesecurity firm owner. He is a creep who really does not understandArquettes moral revulsion. However, when he turns into asniveling whiner after Arquette kidnaps him, he is hilarious. MaryMcCormack seems to have been groomed for a bigger role, butshe mostly stands around and agrees with Tucci. Ryan Reynoldsis too old to play a dumb teenager, but he is funny, especiallytelling his own explicit sexual story to Arquette.The screenplay lurches from romantic comedy to dark comedy toosoon. Capshaw meeting the parents is completely unmotivated,except to give her a reason to get out of town so someone canbreak into her house. Capshaw and Reynolds are in the film justto give Arquette a reason to take revenge on Tucci.Arquette, who has proven he is a good actor, is awful here. Herelies on the constipated mugging that got him through thoseATT ads, and he is not a strong enough presence to build thisweak film around. Actually, Reynolds might have been a betterchoice in the role.Dunskys direction is good, nothing that will win an Oscar soon.Christophe Becks light jazzy score recalls the type of film noir thisfilm tries to be, and it is really catchy on top of that.Despite the pluses, Arquettes failure as a lead and the scriptsschizophrenic quality sinks the film.

Skaggs who has kidnapped Kate for reasons never explained  it is up to Langley to rescue her  end the towns curse...The one  only directorial effort of Richard Governor this odd film did not really do much for me  I did not like it all that much. The script by Duke Sandefur tries to mix the horror  western genres which it does not do to any great effect. Have you ever wondered why there are not more horror western hybrid films out there? Well, neither have I but if I were to ask myself such a question I would find all the answers in Ghost Town because it is not very good. The two genres just do not mix that well. There are plenty of clich\u00e9s, on the western side of things there is the innocent townsfolk who are to scared to stand up to a gang of thugs who are terrorising them, the shootouts in the main street, saloon bars with swing doors  prostitutes upstairs  horror wise there is plenty of cobwebs, some ghosts, an ancient curse, talking corpses  a few violent kills. I was just very underwhelmed by it, I suppose there is nothing terribly wrong with it other than it is just dull  the two genres do not sit together that well. There are a few holes in the plot too, why did Devlin kidnap Kate? I know she resembled his previous girlfriend but how did he know that  what was he going to do with her anyway? We never know why this ghost town is full of ghosts either, I mean what is keeping them there  what caused them to come back as ghosts? Then there is the bit at the end where Devlin after being shot says he cannot be killed only for Langley to kill him a few seconds later, I mean why did not the bullets work in the first place?Director Governor does alright, there is a nice horror film atmosphere with some well lit cobweb strewn sets  the standard Hollywood western town is represented here with a central street with wooden buildings lining either side of it. I would not say it is scary because it is not, there is not much tension either  the film drags in places despite being only just over 80 odd minutes in length. Forget about any gore, there a few bloody gunshot wounds, an after the fact shot of two people with their throats slit  someone is impaled with a metal pole  that is it.I would have imagined the budget was pretty small here, it is reasonably well made  is competent if nothing else. Credit where credit is due the period costumes  sets are pretty good actually. The acting is alright but noones going to win any awards.Ghost Town is a strange film, I am not really sure who it is meant to appeal to  it certainly did not appeal to me. Anyone looking for a western will be annoyed with the dumb horror elements while anyone looking for a horror film will be bored by the western elements.

I do not know about you, but this parallel being drawn provoked in me a maelstrom of emotion and excitement over Thomas C. Dunns film and made the allocation of my time toward it virtually impossible to refuse. Just this kind of recommendation from the NetFlix computer intelligence, for me, had the aestheticmoral movie bar set to level so high that, upon reflection, it represented something pretty much unaccomplished in every film produced in the year 2007.Having prefaced my response to the film that way, I am going to proceed in knocking this picture down as poorly executed and banal; and I really hate to do that because I think our boy, Wes Bentley, happens to be not only one of the most interesting young faces in contemporary cinema, but also one its most overlooked and underrated screenacting talents in the US. I am more than moderately concerned that the poor guys going to miss the fame ship if he keeps fiddling around with first time movie directors like this.The Perfect Witness is about Micky Wes Bentley, who, about thirty, still lives with Mom You are not drinkin again area yas?, but he is a filmmaker or at the very least some kind of streetlevel voyeur with a pension for shooting wouldbe Johns in the seedy back alleys of Philadelphia with his DVX 100B. Out there, doing his private investigatorlike drills, Micky inadvertently videotapes a brutal murder on a hapless earlytwentyish coed with his hand held camcorder. Baring the notion in mind that snuff and movies as cultural currency can be his equated with his ticket out of the white urban ghetto and not to the debts of his unwitting friends and relatives who put up the money for his atrocious films, Micky approaches the assailant, James LeMac Mark Borkowski also takes a writing credit or Mac the Knife \u0096whichever and blackmails the killer into making a documentary about his murder impulses, holding this found footage over the attacker with threats of the police.The problem with this movie is not that no interesting ideas exist because they do. While both the writing and direction are amateurish, that alone does not make a film bad. It is that these guys commit a rather poor assumption that what they are presenting is shocking in the context of a culture in which just about any person in the free world with access to a private computer can logon to the web and catch the veracity of the action of a beheading on their little Mac or PC. No film relies on shock value alone any more unless of course, ironically, it is a film about torture on animals and therefore cinematic images of violence real or fake have less and less cultural capital with each year that passes.

Together, they explore the land and discover dinosaurs and Neanderthals! Can they escape before becoming a permanent resident of the land that Time forgot? Despite being made few years before Star Wars, these films are lightyears apart in terms of special effects. The model shots are little better than anything you would expect to see in an episode of Gerry Andersons Stingray and the creatures are not much better either. When the TRex I am assuming that is what it was was killed, it fell in the same way that zombies do when you kill them  frozen in midwalk and collapsing, arms and legs held out like a sleeping cow that is been pushed over. Granted, the sets are not too bad but the lousy acting and endless explosion noises which all sound the same do their best to ruin credibility and your enjoyment of the picture as a whole. Characters are neither believable or worthy of your sympathy as they fire their guns at seemingly anything that moves. In the end, I just did not care if they got off the island or not and by the time the end came, I was more relieved than entertained.Costumes are authentic enough until the cavemen arrive and it is bearskin bikinis and loin cloths all round.

McClures hero is beyond routine, and does not make much sense in any era.The female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of dinosaurs they entered, but the riddle is not much of a riddle, and we could care less.A lot of failure in a film that should have been better, even for its time.","label":0},{"index":6076,"txt":"This is an amateur movie shot on video, not an electrifying drama as the DVD liner notes falsely boast. I have seen much better stuff from undergrad film students. The bulk of the story unfolds with an allnite taxi ride around Jakarta. This movie could have been made using a single video camera, but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was bounced together later. The editing is extremely rough. The final edit was probably done with two cameras, bouncing content back and forth, instead of with a proper editor. Perhaps they did the editing in the taxi too? The English subtitles were written by someone not fluent in English, e.g., Where you go now? To say the production quality is on a par with Blair Witch is generous. If you are not scared away yet, this film was an ambitious and creative endeavor, with lots of cool and funky images from all over Jakarta.","label":0},{"index":6077,"txt":"My title above says it all.

I was excited to check it out.Alas, I went to the theater and the movie started , I saw it was a Disney movie with production companies listing BBC and Discovery. And when they started the first scenes about the polar bear, I recognized them from my DVDs at home of Planet Earth.The movie continued and went on and on and on , me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from Planet Earth.We were very very disappointed , as I think 90 of the footage is from Planet Earth . I am saying 90 , because some of the scenes I did not recognize. I have a feeling that I simply did not remember them.So finally what this movie really is , is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of Planet Earth , with a narration aimed at kids. Yes, the narration is quite kiddish. Let me give you an example. When they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub , the narrator says The polar cubs are not like human kids. They do not always listen to their mothers  I do not remember the exact words , but this is how it is  So in a nutshell.

It opens with a good song and a great, very underrated band, The Horrorpops, reforming their song, Where They Wander, and promptly getting killed in various gruesome ways. It is a great opening. But the problem is the fact that, up until the end, this was really all that the movie was. A live performance, A death. Another live performance, A death. It gets old. And there is a grossliterally overuse of intestines in the death scenes. Why does not the killer use other body parts, like legs, or eyeballs, or brains? Do not get me wrong, this movie has some parts that are awesome. Like the hardcore French band, known simply as BERET, the prospect of a band named Atticus, the scene containing a performance by members of the The Used and Simple Plan playing together, since neither bands had enough members to play their show, and Bowling For Soups Overweightandproudofit guitarist getting killed in a truly hilarious manner, that I will save for the future watchers of this movie. But the big problem I have with this movie is the at first comical, but after a while, terrible lack of acting talent in a lot of the actors. Especially Warped Tour creator, Kevin Lyman. He tries very hard, but I suspect that he did not want to make the film, but was contractually obligated or something.

The fact that I paid for that does not exactly makes me feel better, as well as the fact the movie deserved the high user rating here.So what is wrong with the movie? It has a fashionable title  44 Minutes. One first thinks about 15 Minutes, which is by the way a much better movie, but still bad in my book, and indeed the two can be compared to some extent. But, as luck would have it, the things they share are their worst characteristics. They both feature Mr. Oleg Taktarov, who with his strong Russian accent obviously meets the popular expectations and prejudices. His purpose is to appeal to the Cold War mind. Ah, do we miss the good old times. Now, I do not imply that he is a bad actor, I am yet to judge his true performance, but he is simply not a true individual here, he is more like an archetype. How anyone can still indulge in such things is completely beyond my comprehension. We can recognize modern American xenophobia here. The point in the movie when Taktarov explains to his companion that Romanians are not Germans, and that they are in America is truly laughable. Are we to assume that the greatest desire of the wretched duo is to become true Americans? Then, there is the media issue. Yes, it seems that the most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and reporters. The director should have made us feel the rhythm of the presumed 44 minutes. Instead he bores us with interviews throughout the movie like in a cheap TV show, trying to reinvent the wheel. In 15 Minutes the issue of media is the central one.The point is presented in a way a teacher addresses an obtuse student, but that deserves a separate comment, we are focusing on 44 Minutes now. So, I have been trying to identify the purpose of this movie. What is it? To provide good time for the audience? To glorify weapons? To glorify police? Portray violence? Oh yes, the officer gives the Bible to the underage delinquent. So it must promote peace and understanding after all? I do not think so, but do not ask me.

Ron Silver is flat as can be, and his attempted love triangle is as telegraphed as anything else in the film He is dating affluent Lisa Rolfe Carrie Fisher, but becomes smitten with oddball coworker Jane Mortimer Catherine Hicks, and I called every scene three scenes before they happen.That is the other problem. Onedimensional characters can survive if they are posited in an intriguing and captivating story, but there is simply nothing here. The films pace is glacial, resplendent with extraneous material that strengthens absolutely nothing, and when the film does begin to follow a linear plot, it is both plodding and uninteresting. There are plenty of guest stars, so to speak, including Harvey Fierstein as a gay New Yorker imagine that in yet another highly inessential scene.Late in the film, it attempts to make a halfwaydecent statement on the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives, but by that time, none of the characters exist as real people, and the film had bored me into submission, so it functions as a case of fartoolittle, fartoolate.

I also noticed that within the Wes Craven Dracula boards there was a real strong following for this movie which is a big contradiction to the scores I was seeing.Now let us take a quick personal recap here. I remember seeing Dracula 2000, and I remember not liking it at all, and then seeing the scores of Dracula Ascension just lowered my expectations even more, but then again, I am the type of person that truly needs to watch the movie myself any movie so that I can form my own opinion.A couple of things I went in knowing when I started watching this movie was that it is low budget, so because of that, I am going to have to ignore a lot of the vfx and just figure it is going to compensated by story  acting, I was also slightly impressed by some of the casting in this movie Jason London, Roy Schieder  Jason Scott LeeOh geez\u0085 This movie was CHEESY! But cheesy can be entertaining at least, I found it pretty fricken laughable, the bad audio synch from the rerecording of dialogue in a FEW scenes, the stupidity of the characters in this movie. Sure they all knew about vampires and some of the basic things, Luke even had a book on it, but did it prevent them from wanting to purposely get infected? Nope, this is worst then slasher flicks where the girl has to get out of the shower and check out the noise she hears with nothing more than a towel on.I also must have blinked at some point, because I am not sure how Dracula got clothes on his body, especially since he is big wild and angry  I figure if I was in that situation, I would not want to be the one dressing him.So the movie ends like any middle movie of a trilogy\u0085 it does not, instead it is a Cliff Hangar where I now get to wait for the 3rd installment Legacy.

I guess, like the auto manufacturers, Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet. Maybe they really do care about the planet, I do not know, but I do not think it warrants a special unit with the word nature in it. I do know that my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse, and who am I to tell a oneyear old my personal feelings about Disney? Aside from incredible cinematography, it was a typical Disney disappointment for me. Preceded by a halfdozen Disney movie trailers, rife with Disney clich\u00e9 circle of life, falling with style, overdramatic music, recycled footage Disney claims 40 new footage. I was even starting to think that James Earl Jones narration is getting a bit boring. I like James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman doing every Warner Brothers narrative starts to wear thin. I really think that Disney bought some BBC nature photography that was so spectacularly done, they felt it would sell itself if they slapped some orchestral music and recognizable soundbites on it.And what is Disneys obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals? There were a halfdozen such scenes, complete with bleating youngsters on the verge of getting their throats ripped out. I think Disney needs to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to the actionmovie oriented teenagers that got dragged to this film by their parents. I was also cognizant of how Disney stopped well short of implying that man had anything to do with the climate change. Are they so afraid of the tiny minority of deniers that they think it is still a controversial subject? I recommend skipping this one and renting the Blue Planet DVDs on Netflix.

The movie keeps setting up wonderful situations and refuses to do anything with them.For example the med students attempt to bring drac back to life by placing him in a bathtub filled with blood in a secluded run down country mansion. The house itself is scary enough to be the center of the film, but do we stay there? no because they decide to take the vampire to an abandoned swimming pool. sigh. This movie has a real problem with homages as i mentioned before the opening scene is straight out of hammer, and this house scene would have been perfect for a hammerlike movie, but the movie rapidly switches gears and changes to a medical horror.The other problem is that they introduce so many characters it is almost impossible to feel sorry for any of them. There are the med students and their wheelchair bound professortype friend the med students are all arrogant, boring, money hungry, and stupid. how they made it to med school at all amazes me, unless the med school had to meet its muscle bound hunkbig breast quota. and then there is the vampire hunter who remains mysterious through the movie. hey i can respect that but it would be nice if they did not set it up like the movie would be about him. then you have random priests, cops, and science types. so many people are introduced and then quickly forgotten about until they need that person to either save the day or jump out for a cheap scare that it becomes quickly tedious.Basically this is a lazy movie. no real scares, just a few predictable jump scares. The set up for these is so elaborate it is hilarious. for examp le the bathtub full of blood. it is so obvious that drac is going to pop out of the murky blood. and yet we have to wait far too long to get to the inevitable jump scare. after this he kills one of the dumber and larger breasted med students. we all know she is going to become one of the undead. but what do the others do? bury her in a shallow grave near the house. sigh, so you know who will jump out at you when the cops show up at the house..........Oh well.Maybe someone will get the hint that it is impossible to make a scary vampire movie and just go for atmospheric, and then we will end up with an entire movie that is as good as the opening scene.","label":0},{"index":6117,"txt":"Ascension is actually a step up in terms of what the original movie was in story and in special effects.

I just paid 8.75 to see something I already own on DVD. Shame on Disney for not warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here save a James Earl Jones voiceover and 90 seconds of sailfish that I do not believe were in Planet Earth.But the biggest crime of all, is that while Planet Earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecologic change, Disney took that story and turned it into family friendly tripe. After the male polar bears demise, they show his cubs grown significantly a year later, and spew some garbage about how they are ready to carry on his memory, and that the earth really is a beautiful place after all. No mention of the grown cubs impending deaths due to the same plight their father endured, no warning of trouble for future generations if we do not get our act together, nothing.

Not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region in which this story takes place and it is blatantly obvious with names like Lee and Hernandez. If movie makers want to engross us in a culture like the Jugars and the Kazaks, they damn well better use actorsactresses that look the part.Warring tribes, a prophecy, brotherly love and respect, a love interest that separates our heroes, are all touched on but with so little impact and screen time that most viewers will brush them aside in favor of the next battle sequence, the next action horse scene, or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape.It is worth mentioning that there were some significant changes made to Nomad during its filming, specifically the director and cinematographer. Ivan Passer director was replaced by Sergei Bodrov, and Ueli Steiger cinematographer was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In one respect, Laustsen seems to have the better eye since his visions of the lands made the final cut that we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, the changing over to Bodrov as director may not have been the wisest choice. From what I am seeing here, the focus is on the battles and not the people, which I sense comes from Bodrovs eyes and not Passers. A true travesty.The most shameful aspect is that this could have been a really fantastic film, with both character and action focuses.

I am not quite sure what they mean by groundbreaking and original when they fawn all over Lynch and his silly little TV opus. What exactly is their criteria of what is original? Sure, compared to the Bill Cosby Show or Hill Street Blues it is original. Definitely. Next to Law  Order TP spews originality left and right.Fans of TP often say that the show was canceled because too many viewers were not smart enough, open enough for the show is supposed weirdness, its alleged wild ingenuity, or whatever. As a fan of weirdness myself, I have to correct that misconception. There is nothing too offthewall about TP; it is a merely watchable, rather silly whodunit that goes around in circles, spinning webs in every corner but or because of it ultimately going nowhere. The supposed weirdness is always forced; the characters do not behave in a strange way as much as they behave in an IDIOTIC way half the time. There is a difference...Whenever I watch the weird dream sequence in Living In Oblivion in which the dwarf criticizes the director Buscemi for succumbing to the tired old let ususeamidgetinadreamscene clich\u00e9, I think of Lynch. You want weird? Eraserhead is weird  in fact, it is beyond weird, it is basically abstract. You want a unique TV show? Watch The Prisoner. You want a strangelooking cast? Felinis and Leones films offer that. TP looks like an overly coiffed TV crime drama in which all the young people look like fashion models. The cast gives TP a plastic look. Kens  Barbies en masse.In fact, one of the producers of TP said that Lynch was looking for unique faces for the series. Unique faces? Like Lara Flynn Boyles? Sheryll Fenns? Like those effeminatefaced hunks straight out of mens catalogs or gay magazines? Do not get me wrong; there is nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially with beauties like Fenn the way Madonna would look if she were 1000 times prettier, but then do not go around saying you are making a weird show with weirdlooking people. And I have never understood Lynchs misguided fascination with Kyle MacLachlan I should get a medal for bothering to spell his name right. He is not unlikable, but lacks charisma, seeming a little too bland and polished. His characters laughable eccentricities were not at all interesting, merely one of Lynchs many attempts to force the weirdness, trying hard to live up to his reputation  him having completely lost his edge but that time. Everything Lynch made postElephant Man was very much subpar compared to his first two movies. What followed were often mediocre efforts that relied on Lynchs relatively small but fanatical fan base to keep him in the public eye by interpreting meanings into his badly puttogether stories that do not hold any water on closer scrutiny. In other words, Lynch is every intellectualwannabes darling. So Laura Palmer was killed by her Dad...? He was obsessed by the devil or some such nonsense. That is the best this great mind could come up with... You have got Bmovie horror films that end with more originality.

His intended is Inez McDowell Muriel Lawrence whose pesky younger sister, Jeanie Eileen Christy, is slowly realizing she is in love with the nearly impecunious songsmith. Foster is in love with Inez who is revolted by the composers Number 1 on the Levee Hit Parade Tune, O Susannah.

The sets are lavish in that special Hollywood way that portrayed fakes with all the trimmings. The singers are not half bad and the Foster songs are almost impossible to ruin.But this is also a literal whitewash of the antebellum South. The biggest number features blackface for all on stage, an historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of unthinking racism. Were these portrayals of blacks anywhere near reality, the abolitionists would be rightly condemned for interfering with so beneficent an institution.I Dream of Jeanie apparently sank into the studios vault with barely a death whisper. Now revived by Alpha Video for a mere 4.99 it is a period piece with charming songs and repulsive sentimentalizing about the victims of Americas great crime, slavery.This was what Hollywood was putting out two years before Brown v.

The film is organized as a life remembered in asynchronous fragments rather than in a sequential flow as one directly experienced.The narration has its lyrical moments, particularly in describing the impact of loss anticipated or experienced. The dialog unfortunately lacks such grace. The script frequently compels the actors to say startlingly stupid or insensitive things that seem utterly out of character at the moment. On their second accidental encounter, clearly smitten with each other, sensitive Phillip encourages a reluctant Guy to tell him about his difficult week. But the moment Guy begins to open up, Phillip, an English Major, blurts out You are not a Crisis Fairy, are you? Later, watching his lovers naked, chiseled body stride across the bedroom toward him, our young Shakespeare in love begins to render the beauty of the moment in words, The way you cut through space....I cannot even describe itbut lacks the verbal skills to complete his thought. This kind of drivel continues through the AIDS Hospice scenes, bejeweled with lines like, What made me think death would be all neat and tied up with ribbons? and You make Florence Nightingale look like Nurse Ratchet. The film often suffers from a bruising lack of subtlety. Unlikable characters are far more jarring and steamrollerflattened than they need to be. Phillips thoroughly annoying friendsan arrogant trust fund brat and a whining, needy dweebmaintain a running caustic diatribe about every one crossing their path. Such patter could offer a writer a wealth of opportunities for clever social commentary, but sadly, their remarks are merely unpleasant, ungraced by wit or insight. It is hard to know if our scriptwriter intentionally crafted intellectually limited characters or if he was simply running his tethers perimeter.The plot may be what most appeals to and resonates with those who praise this film. It does seriously explore 1980s US middle class gay life first encounters, courting, coupling, nesting, the complexity of open relationships, friction and fracturing, dissolution, physical abuse, rapprochement, forgiveness, terminal illness, death and survival. Leads Phelan and Spirtas give fair to good performances rendering complex characters over time. Their fetching good looks help explain both the chemistry that held these two together through insensitivity and selfishness as well as the chemistry that helped some some viewers overlook this films painful weaknesses. The decision to chop the plot arc into tidbits and present them in outofsequence flashbacks added complexity without any evident dramatic utility, and in several cases left the sequence and thus the implications of a given event unclear.Could I recommend the film? To sticklers for literary and technical quality, absolutely not! For easy going viewers in serious need of an AIDS survivor catharsis or in the mood for a guiltypleasure tearjerker with a little eye candy thrown in, maybe.

During the confusion, Laura escapes into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the islands natives, who offer her up to their god.Franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks crap gore, murky cinematography, rapid zooms, numerous crotch shots, out of focus imagery, awful sound effects, and hamfisted editing. The result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish It took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing, and even the sight of the luscious Buchfellner in all of her natural glory as not enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry.","label":0},{"index":6167,"txt":"Bufords Beach Bunnies gives Bgrade TA films a bad name.

Yes, even they got their hands into low exploitation sickies like this, and Bamboo is definitely among the worse attempts of the whole genre, even when compared to the Western attempts that usually pale in comparison with the Eastern films!The story is about a Japanese war camp in which the Chinese women are brutalized, abused and raped by the bad Japanese what else? during the World War II. The girls also know a secret place in which a box full of gold is hidden and also learn that a Chinese military officer raised in Japan Shaw veteran Lo Lieh is actually now an undercover agent among the other Japanese and naturally helps the girls escape the hell. What follows is sequences full of gratuitous nudity, female kung fu, some nasty torture, gore, sleaze and extremely offensive anti Japan attitude that make this film pure and honest garbage that does not even try to be more than it is.There are hardly any interesting elements in Bamboo House of Dolls. The occasional photography especially at the end looks nice with its sunbeams and beautiful nature but that is about it in the merits department. The fight scenes are plenty and always include half naked females hitting and kicking each other. The violence overall is quite nasty at times with several bullet wounds, misogynistic torture scenes for example, one poor girl is brutalized on the floor filled with broken glass etc. and extremely repulsive ending and moral behind it. Of course it is stupid to talk about moral when writing about this kind of film, but still there are elements I will not accept to be found from any film.The film has also some enjoyable turkey elements for sure! For example, the gold box, filled with heavy gold, seems suspiciouly light as the weak and suffered girls do not seem to have any problems lifting and moving it, not to speak of throwing it! Also those numerous skin fight scenes make this quite smile inducing for fans of trash cinema. I have seen the same directors Killer Snakes 1973 which is ten times more noteworthy as a piece and even though it has many alive snakes killed for real, it is also visually more interesting and shows us some nasty sides of the other side of the big city and society. Also, it is a must for those who fear snakes.Bamboo House of Dolls has suffered some censorship, too, which is not a surprise considered the subject matter. The uncut version, dubbed into a nonEnglish language released in Europe at least in France, Italy and Switzerland, runs 104 PAL minutes while the cut, English dubbed print released in Holland, Belgium and Greece runs only 84 minutes in PAL. From what I have heard, the cut scenes are not only violence or other graphic stuff but also dialogue and plot development and the like.Bamboo House of Dolls is garbage cinema in its most trashy form and definitely something I would not have liked to see from the Shaw Brothers or Hong Kong in general. Some of the Italian exploitation films of the same subject matter are much more interesting and noteworthy than this quite ridiculous, calculated and worthless piece of cinema exploitation. 210","label":0},{"index":6170,"txt":"Previous comment made me write this.

Both main characters are friends and coexist very well in an country and economy that is not booming while at the same time not failing. Their families get together and have parties and they practice their favorite sport, Sport Rifle shooting, as comrades not as competitors.But, after the 1st 15 minutes the plot runs into a fork in the road. The audience is expected to believe that for some unknown reason these friends must hate each other. That for some unknown reason Bosnia is now on a path to conflict. Sure, the script adds in TV footage which the characters appear to be watching live news programs in English, but the clips are from 1993 not 1992 when the war began.The history, the 1990 elections, the people who caused the war are not mentioned. The movie tries to place the blame with Karadzic, who had been a Presidential candidate and leader of the Bosnian Parliaments 2nd Largest PartySDP. According to the Constitution of Bosnia, the SDP was to have the Presidency in 1992, but there was a Coup in January. The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Action Party seized total control and held a segregated referendum in March in which it declared itself the law in Bosnia and announced Secession.The history of the IDAP begins with Bosnian Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, a man suspiciously absent from STtH. He was a student of Nazism in WW2. He even wrote his own Mein Kampf in which he stated It is not in fact possible for there to be any peace or coexistence between the Islamic Religion and nonIslamic social and political institutions.In 1990 he lost the IDAP elections to proYugoslavia Moderate Fikret Abdic, a Bosnian Muslim, that worked with Christian Serbs during the Civil War, and who treated his supporters like brothers. Abdic was prevented from taking power by Izetbegovic, who lost the elections but seized the seat of power.The events from above are missing from the movie, but they are the factual events that lead to the war.There were problems with props too. Serb soldiers in the movie were wearing Soviet WW2 helmets, which they did not use.

Similar to Goldie Hawns WILDCATS, it stars Cathy Lee Crosby in the title role, and she does as about as well as the script allows. I think Racquel Welch would have been a better choice, but considering the films apparent TV movie budget, they probably could not afford her. Cathy Lee does look great in every shot, but we never get to see her completely nude. The story is pretty predictable, to say the least, offering no surprises. A young and lucky Michael Biehn has the male lead role. He is the star on the team and also the love interest for Cathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has a few amusing scenes as the rich old man who runs the athletic program and does not think a woman should coach sports. This point is brought up throughout the film, and, needless to say, is dated. Ironically, Cathy Lee does not put her team through any unorthodox practice sessions; she does not do anything a male coach would not do. There is a funny subplot involving a tall and notsobright player who undergoes hypnosis in order to pass his classes and play like pro basketball player Sydney Wicks. It looks like everyone had a good time making this film, but the only real reason to see it is for Cathy Lee Crosby.

So when I heard Sky were doing the coverage for British TV I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the links , but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne ! Oh gawd if British TV are desperate for film critics  Obviously they are  I am sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly over to LA to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers Chris Rock was not too bad , but he is no Steve Martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in ! Not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion . The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the  minor  Oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats ! There is no such thing as a  minor  Oscar and just because the award is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design they are as well deserved as Best Picture or Best Director . All the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium . What a bunch of arrogant snobs the Academy are becoming and I quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it was not for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history . As for the awards themselves Best Supporting Actress  Cate Blanchett . No great surprise for a competitive category Best Supporting Actor  Morgan Freeman . No real complaints since Freeman is one of Americas greatest living character actors Best Actor  Jamie Foxx . Most predictable award of the night . Yawn Best Actress  Hilary Swank . Major surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night Best Director  Clint Eastwood . Major surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award simply because he would never won one . Actually I am glad about this because if he did not deserve it for TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS he did not deserve it for THE AVIATOR Best Film  MILLION DOLLAR BABY . Again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while I thought the Hollywood friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDBs controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they have not done in the past , I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawds sake !

I think it is seriously time to look for a new director and producers for the show, who can come up with something REALLY new. It is pretty obvious that they tried to make the show more hip and appealing for a younger audience this year by letting Beyonce perform and letting P. Diddy and Prince present a category. Also letting Chris Rock be the presenter was an attempt to renew the ceremony and make it more appealing. None of it really worked out.Sure, Chris Rock is a funny guy but he was not really a good presenter. I really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories. His presence was not really as big as for instance Billy Crystals.Also the handing out of the awards was pretty dumb at times. Not letting everybody come to the stage but also handing out some of the awards in the middle of the theater was plain weird.Still, I cannot remember being any more satisfied with the award winners. None of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case. So does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive contestants? I do not think so. I think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years from now, with the exception of Million Dollar Baby and The Passion of the Christ maybe. Sure I do not agree with every single award that was handed out this year, for instance Caleb Deschanel should had won for best cinematography, not that I do not like Robert Richardsons work, he really did some amazing work for most of Oliver Stones work but I really feel that Deschanel deserved the award way more. Also I would had liked seeing Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win for best editing and John Debney for best music. But oh well, there is no way the Academy Awards can please everybody of course, I understand that. There will always be people complaining about the winners.It also was funny to see that most of the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners.

I am not talking about the awards themselves as usual, there is plenty to argue about when you tally up who won, who lost, and who never even got nominated, but the process is as it is always been and is as fair as it is liable to be. What is terribly UNfair is the treatment both the stars and nonstars received at the hands of Cates and Horvitz, in the name of reducing boredom.It is bad enough that for the last several years anyone who is not Al Pacino has been played off at 45 seconds without any regard for what he was saying, how he was saying it, and what the emotion was behind the statement. It demonstrates nothing more than a total lack of respect, however, to herd nominees on the stage like cattle without paying them the honor of showing their faces while their names are read, to make them slink away quietly when they lose, to deny them the thrill of a walk to the podium, and to force them to read their statements with their backs to the audience. All of those things were done to the nonstars never mind that the movies would not exist at all without those artists and that most of them only ever get one chance to face their peers and their audience. The stars did not fare much better. It is becoming more sad than funny when winners of the caliber of Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood have to beg for a few extra seconds for their speeches. Chris Rock, as host, was neither as inflammatory and controversial as the Academy had hoped, nor nearly as funny as he could be. His opening remarks were almost but not quite as offensive as Sean Penn made them out to be, and his comments during the show were more innocuous than interesting. Of course, he could hardly be blamed when it was clear that was being kept on as short a leash as any host has. In the end, Chris Rock was something he is almost never been before a nonentity.Even the musical numbers were handled poorly. Beyonce sang well, but there was simply no reason why she should have been featured in three out of the five songs. Another example of utter disrespect for an artist was giving Jorge Drexlers nominated song to Antonio Banderas even though Drexler was present and clearly would not have minded singing his own song, based on his winning speech. The efforts of Cates and Horvitz to make the show shorter and faster may have worked to a degree, but what resulted was a show devoid of life. We have all whined about the overlong speeches given by people we do not know, about the overblown production, about the selfcongratulatory quality. But this is THEIR night not ours. What is meant to be a celebration has become an insult to the people being celebrated.

It is not.City Hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters, names, and realistic citywide issues, that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating, that once you find out the truth, it will blow your mind. In truth, however, these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as Corruption of Power, TwoFaced Politicians, Mafia with Police ties, etc. And theoretically, this setup allows for some thrilling tension, the fear that none of the characters are safe, and anything could happen! But again, it really does not.Unfortunately, the only things that happen are quite predictable, and we are left with several confession monologues, that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the real world of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spiderweb of lies and coverups, the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal.

This causes the pacing to suffer, with the jokes not very funny at all. To be more specific, what really causes this film to suffer is the fact that the jokes as they are, are just pasted together into a cobbledtogether script, rather than serving a central plot as the other 3 Vacation films have.

That fault surely lies with director Hackerling, who is obviously nowhere near as good a director as Harold Ramis and a very uninspiring script that has only a handful of decent lines scattered around.The cast does what they can; Chevy Chase injects some form of life into the proceedings but it is simply not enough and the very funny Eric Idle is completely wasted in a small role as a very unlucky Englishman. Some potentially hilarious moments are not played out to their full potential and leave the viewer mostly aggravated. All depictions of Europeans are onedimensional and almost universally not funny at all like how the English are SOOO polite.Apart from a few scenes, there is hardly a laugh in sight and the ending turn this one into complete slapstick.

European Vacation is not one of them. The followup to Hughes first big hit Vacation 1983, is about as predictable, unfunny and annoying as they come  no matter how much you love the dumb but romantic Clark and Ellen Griswold Chase and DAngelo.I greatly enjoyed Vacation as well as the third film, 1989s Christmas Vacation, but the Griswolds trip to Europe is bland and forced. Perhaps because this was Hughes first attempt at a sequel that he did not get it, but it is really dumbfounding how uninspired and devoid of a story European Vacation is. There is no through story the Griswolds win a game show for being greedy little pigs and go on a tour of Europe through England, France, Germany and Italy. Even the screwball physical humor that is the trademark of the first loses all effect because you see it coming, which is part director Amy Heckerlings fault. The Fast Times at Ridgemont High director sets everything up too predictably.Maybe it was Hughes taking a cheap shot because he was put up to the sequel. European Vacation takes great pride in insulting Americans recall the greedy little pig game show they win, especially tourists, represented by the cornball Griswold family. It also pats itself on the back implicitly saying oh us Griswolds, we are always getting into something because our dad is an idiot. Then in nearly comic fashion it ends with a tribute to America and how grateful the Griswolds are to return to such a better country. If Hughes was going for satire and meant to do it in the form of a bad movie, well maybe I should award this 810 stars.It is not just the unfunniness, but European Vacation boasts the two worst actors to play kids Rusty and Audrey Jason Lively and Dana Hill. They are both annoying and obnoxious, with the unattractive and loudmouthed Audrey blubbering about the boyfriend she is left behind nearly the entire film. Hughes even goes as far as to have her comment about missing him right as she observes a giant bratwurst. Quite tasteful. Speaking of, breasts are flashed in two different scenes for no good reason unless it was to comment on Americans love of gratuitous nipples in their comedies.I will give the film one of its two stars thanks to Eric Idle of the Monty Python crew, whose cameo at a few different points in the film where he recites lines directly from Holy Grail is about the funniest part. If Hughes intended for us to find one of the films only non American actors as the only funny part, then another tip of the hat to him for ripping open the underbelly of Hollywood comedy in the 80s.

Clark answers back, No, I will have it right here. That is really about the only line that is funny in this film.European Vacations humor is strained. As if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first movie, tried to rehash a script that had been done before, and relied on a ridiculous slapstick chase scene sequence toward the end of the picture just to kill time.Worse, the natural comic standouts like Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie and the original kids who played Rusty and Audrey from the first movie so well are nowhere to be found. Their replacements are not funny, cannot act, and just look like they are going through the motions most of the time. There are also a few crude sex jokes and comments that are not only not funny, they are in bad taste.The Griswalds should have stayed in Wally World. The place that made them legends!

For this movie to be realistic, it would have to be set in the fifties, if not the late forties.Rise to Power has no sign of Gail Pennelope Ann Miller, no sign of Kleinfeld, no sign of Rolando that Carlito supposedly ran with in his heyday. None of the primary characters in the original film were in this movie. We are supposed to believe that Carlito met all these people in the span of a few years.Rise to Power ends with Carlito walking down the beach talking about retiring in paradise which is what he wanted to do in the original film. Also, the prequel creates the Rocco and Earl characters  what is supposed to happen with them since they are clearly not in Carlitos Way? It is also hard to understand how Carlito could have the relationship with the Italians he has in the original film watching the events of Rise to Power. Where are the Taglialuccis in this film? There is probably seven years between the two films and he spends five of them in prison. It is like trying to put a square plug into a round hole.It is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making some bucks by making an average gangster film and throwing a character called Carlito Brigante into the story. The film had some good moments but I think they would have been better off leaving this movie to stand by itself instead of trying to make it a prequel to Carlitos Way.If you feel determined to see this movie, the only advice I can give is to not think of the movie as a linear prequel.

Not one of Carlitos close old friends from the original make an appearance in this movie, they are not even mentioned. Luis Guzman, Pachanga in the original, is in the movie but he plays a completely different character. The original takes place in 1975 and the prequel takes place in 196970.

In the original, Carlito starts out being released from jail after spending 5 years in jail. That is only a few months between the end of the prequel and the start of the original! Semi Spoiler We know from the beginning of the original, Carlito has spent 5 years in prison so when the prequel gives us this Hollywood happy ending it is an insult to the intelligence of fans of the original.

Rise to Power is just a movie that has Carlitos name. There should have been at least a few characters from the original movie, the ending makes no sense in relation to the original.

I remember that Nacho Reyes had a much bigger role in the book. It is been a while since I read the book, but where did Sean Combs character come from? Also, I think this movie really glosses over the racial tensions in Harlem that Torres was writing about. And, the mob does not get the treatment that they did in the book.

Instead it seemed like this was just one of many stories that could be told of Carlito. All or even some of the questions about his past that we wondered about in the original could have been answered. As far as I am concerned, thats the only way you can make this movie. Instead we get this prequel that has almost NONE of the original characters in it, a character that plays a different part from the original horrible move, and a totally different love interest for Carlito. Do not even get me started with Puffy. No way can I take that cat seriously as a gangsta after watching him dance in all his artists videos. Evertytime that dude opened his mouth I was waiting for him to start dancing. He made me laugh if anything. Mario Van Peeples surprised me with his role. I thought he was gonna give a lackluster performance due to his recent history. He did rather well. He was probably the most believable out of the entire cast in my opinion. Jay Hernandez did his best but does not have the skills right now in his career to take on this role. I appreciated his energy and his efforts though. Hard to follow up Pacino. The only way you could even have a clue about what kind of person Carlito was, is to watch the original. Otherwise, Carlito looks like a cold blooded killer in one scene then a spineless wimp in another. He was one of the baddest gangstas of his time but you would only see flashes of that in this movie. Maybe this is a pitiful way for Hollywood to try and make a 2nd prequel to cash in on this failure.

The only reason I gave it a 3 was because I laughed a lot and Mario Van Peeples earned some respect back with me. A serious director should have taken this movie and actually put time into the story and turned it into an actual prequel. I am extremely disappointed that this movie was not taken seriously. They would have been better off making this into a miniseries on HBO and actually telling the story like the original suggests.

Why watch Cuckoos Nest or any other madhouse drama when you can have Zizek for more than 2 hours? It is like watching an amusing train wreck. Admittedly, he is almost funny on one or two occasions.I have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate moviemaking into an exalted intellectual social science. Giving idiotic movies like Birds this much thought, hence this much credit, probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave. The raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value, and the few ones that do have some intelligence do not require a shrinkturnedphilosopher to draw one a map to understand them \u0096 unless one is a complete idiot. Zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies. Hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in Slovenia these days...When Zizek showed the bathtub hole in the Psycho shower scene, I thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes; how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in Janet Leighs blood. Or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents Leighs vagina, with the blood flowing into it instead of out as in menstruation, this representing some kind of clever Zizekian irony. Speaking of which, the real irony is that if Hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene and the script, his movies would not have been the illogical, farfetched crap that they often are. The point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about hidden, deep meanings. And when you add Zizeks fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology, layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations, you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated  i.e. the easily impressionable and the gullible.Zizek utters a number of unintentionally funny things here, one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates Anthony Perkinss cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with the satisfaction of work, of a job well done. Do not laugh... Neither Hitchcock nor the writer of Psycho could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that Perkins might be enjoying a job well done  the cleaning of a bloodstained toilet  while they were conceivingdirecting that scene. Talk about putting words into ones dead mouth, but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to say.I like Zizeks initial thoughts on Tarkovskys terrific Solaris, but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in antifeminism and other nonsense into his theory.Zizeks attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone. I just want to play with it all day! Logic has its rules, and is not supposed to be raped  at least not publicly  by the likes of him. He seems to regard logic, proof, commonsense, and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys; concepts to be either avoided, twisted to fit the endgoal, or simply annihilated. Zizek is the LSDtripped hippie, and all his favorite movies are his own personal 2001s.The fact that Zizek overfocuses on two of the most overrated directors  and ones whose films often LACK intelligence, if anything  such as Hitchcock and Lynch, only further diminishes his already low credibility. I was surprised De Palma did not feature more prominently; that is another lame director who writes inept scripts. Zizek has a field day with Lynchs incomprehensible Lost Highway. There are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it.Zizeks comment that the viewer readily accepts von Triers laughable, groundbreaking physical setup in Dogville made me snicker. However, Zizek does not only make up stuff as he goes along, he also indulges heavily in the bleedin obvious. Like all social scientists an oxymoron, he wraps his very trite observations into articulate if full of spitting and sometimes complex blankets of language. After all, sociology functions in precisely the same way it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it is what we already all know, but told in an eloquent way  which fools the more unobservant listener.I was halfexpecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a looniesuit...Slavoj Zizek soon as a stalker in a kids park near you.httprateyourmusic.comlistFedor8150_worst_cases_of_nepotism","label":0},{"index":6222,"txt":"Where can I begin. I heard this movie was coming out and I was very mad. I am a huge fan of the original Carlitos Way and when I heard about this, I thought it would be just like almost all the other sequels that come out in Hollywood. I thought it would be bad. Boy was I wrong, this movie was much worse than I expected. Not saying all sequels are bad, but thats the problem with Hollywood these days, they make too many sequels and remakes and rush them. This was not a theater release, it is a DVD release. Still, in my opinion, there was no reason at all for this to be made. After I heard about this film was in progress, I then later heard Pacino was not in it. That right away killed any chance this movie had of being good. Why did I check this movie out then some of you may ask? Well I had the opportunity to see it so I did. I do not only watch movies that I have high expectations of, I had low expectations on this one obviously. I just wanted to see if it would have anything relevant in it. Now, if any of you reading this are a Carlitos Way fan, you know a lot of the story in the first one has to do with him going to jail.VERY MINOR SPOILER I wont ruin anything, because this may actually make you not want to waste 2 hours watching this trash. All I will say is in the end of Carlitos Way 2, we do not see Carlito go to jail. Now, I do not know about any of you, but I would have thought a prequel to Carlitos Way would show how he ended up in jail. I even had some interest in actually seeing what happened.Now, thats not my only problem with the film. The actor who played Carlito did not do too bad a job, but he could not have saved this film if he tried. There is not even all those little things that should be thrown in there that Carlitos Way fans would like. You do not see any appearance of Kleinfeld or other key characters in the first one, I would have liked to see something like that. What is even worse, is Luis Guzman is in this film, yet he does not play the same character he plays in the first film. Big mistake on their part, why cast the same actor for a different character, it made the movie worse than it already was.Bottom line, I am a Carlitos Way fan, this new straight to DVD release is a disgrace. If you are a fan, do not watch this movie coming in with high expectations. This movie did basically nothing for me, and it is definitely one movie I wont be picking up on DVD, or watching ever again.","label":0},{"index":6223,"txt":"Every generation fully believes it is living in the end times.

Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of Friends often share the same comedy setups.The show is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were still rather young about 10 years old I think. Now, they are in their midtwenties, and they meet again on a class reunion. This is where the series starts.A typical episode deals with multiple story lines at once. They are usually not connected in any way. Each story line is cut up into multiple sections, which are then shown in a mixed order.The sketches is where my problems lie with this series. As in the later seasons of Friends, it is often a rather silly setting with hard to believe situations. One of the main characters does something really stupid that is hard to believe. The situation is then heavily exaggerated, as if it was not silly enough. If you are into this kind of inyourface humor, then maybe you will like this series. For me it is a great turnoff.The reason I started watching Friends is because of the first few seasons. There are interesting and especially credible story lines, with some romance in it that makes you root for the characters. The Class has none of this. The characters are simply too forced and stereotypes are pushed too far. It is therefore not possible to relate to them and like them.At least with friends, it took several seasons before it ran out of steam and the character traits were all milked out.

With Barricade, Timo Rose tries to give the wellworn routine a Teutonic twist, by transplanting the action to The Black Forest and giving it the German lowbudget splatter treatment. The result is a very bloody, but totally unoriginal effort that is made almost unwatchable thanks to some dreadful directorial decisions\u0097in particular, the nonstop use of fancy filters and irritating editing techniques.Had Timo Rose not opted to utilise every naff trick his editing software offered him, then Barricade might have been a reasonably entertaining gorefest his inexperienced cast do reasonably well; the bloody effects are suitably stomach churning; and there are one or two scares and even some well conceived creepy moments. All of this, however, is completely ruined by the awful camerawork, choppy editing, and overwhelming barrage of visual gimmickry used to give the film the distressed look that is so inexplicably popular with todays filmmakers.I give Barricade 3 out of 10 purely for the outlandish gore, which includes a nifty scene where a guy is forced to drink acid, loads of nasty wounds caused by a variety of sharp implements, and some pretty decent shotgun damage.","label":0},{"index":6230,"txt":"Well I just gave away 95 minutes and 47 seconds that I will never get back on this piece of trash. I heard someone online describe this movies villains as subhuman cannibals, and I thought it was promising because I thought it would be like the Descent. WRONG! The Descent was a psychological thriller with dynamic characters and strong storyline. These villains are totally unrealistic and no part of their performance is enjoyable to watch. This movie is not so controversial, I have seen this level of gore in many films. This movie plain sucks. SYNOPSIS A blonde who thinks she is real hot but she is not, her admirer, and her admirers friend no, I do not remember their names go into the woods. Their car breaks down. They are warned to leave by a man named Mark. The blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they cannot find the admirers friend. Admirer impales his foot whoops!. Do not worry, he is much more upset when his car will not start than when he gets impaled by nails. After a nanosecond of coaxing, the blond leaves to find help. Events ensue that I cannot remember. During this and throughout the movie, we are shown grotesque torture scenes with no substance including one that made me gag. Blonde goes to save admirer from house of cannibals even though all they are seen eating is intestines, which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to eat since they contain actual food. Blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard unsuccessfully to work up tears. Then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the house and announces she can out think them. Mark the man who warned them to leave has a remarkable change of character when he reveals the cannibals are his family. Then there is some shooting, they leave the house, the shooting continues, then a random guy shows up and says he is been watching them. Before he is shot, we are shown an acidtrip inspired scene of more killing. The blonde or her admirer shoots him because he did not help them. There is more killing, the admirer professes his love for the blonde. Then a mysterious hand covers the camera. What does that imply? I do not know, hopefully not a sequel.","label":0},{"index":6231,"txt":"Wow, after trashing the disk of Timo Roses Rout City after about 15 Minutes South Park is about more than meaningless cursing... I guess some people just do not get it I was interested in this movie. I read quite some positive stuff and the packaging and look of the movie seemed far from the total trash I expected after Rout city.Surprise The movie is not total trash but the problem seems to be exactly that. Timo Rose tries to walk in the footsteps of German HorrorSplatter Cinema like Olaf Ittenbach and the likes. That means Barricade is in parts extremely gory and detailed. The gore FX are not really believable but OK, the acting is OK but in some cases plain sucks. The hillbilly chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous and does not get better till she is shot.So what is the problem... the movie is gory, has a typical German underground vibe including the classic booby shots in blood, OK FX and a modern feel to it like the packaging already promised?! 1. The script is total BS. You get a typical hillbillylost in the woods story with some guysgal camping out and meeting a degenerated hillbilly family. Everything is just leading towards the torturemutilation scenes and seems unbelievably random and pointless. This is the first thing that makes Barricade halfhearted.2. Random is also the perfect description for a lot of the camera work I liked the repetitive cut to the tweezers in the extended booby torture scene... either they had no material or the editor works in a hardware store. Even worse the editing... sure, its modern and far better than a lot of other movies in the genre but its RANDOM. You got an overuse of that typical exposure effect everywhere and with no meaning ... its just there... all the time. Then there is some grainynoisy film look which also is just thrown in here and there for the sake of it, I do not get the meaning.3. Like the forementioned effects there is a lot of repetitive stuff in here. For example most of the kills are edited with multiple repetitions of stabbing and punching. Its OK once but here its annoying and fake, especially towards the end. Annoying also attributes the music which is permanently used without any change in the background. It does not take long until it makes the movie hardly bearable.4. From all this comes the biggest problem of this movie and many others in my opinion. If you make a splatter movie with trashy feel its pretty idiotic to polish it with special FX and new school editing. It looks like they take it way too serious. Its no fun because the decent gore FX are plain wasted in this context. And where the classic gore FX are OK the computer FX in scenes like the stabbing in the mouth or the gunshots in the ending look rather sillyand 3D splatter mostly sucks to me even in movies with a budget and decent 3D artists.I often wondered if the time of serious splatter movies is over and Barricade is just another example it might be time to put it in the tomb. Its no fun, has no character and is too trashy for its look. The script is a cheap try on Wrong Turn and TCM leading absolutely nowhere. You can take that literally... the ending is just there and as random as many other things here I love you in a splatter flick... come on!!. Barricade tries to incorporate a lot and fails...you can sure fastforward through this movie for some extensive disembowelment, acid face melting,nipple pinching and classic Friday the 13th style stabbing of a couple while fingering in a tent bloody boobies hooray!.

A big part of its appeal was that the writers looked to folklore and science for their ideas, tying the plot to the spooky side of real life.I was incredibly wary of the 8th season when it aired. The show had already provided two perfectly good episodes to bow out on One Son and Requiem, and the 7th season had seen a sharp rise in episodes that scraped the barrel for ideas that were farfetched, implausible, or downright silly. But I figured, hey, give it the benefit of a doubt, maybe they are bringing it back because they have got some great ideas lined up.Roadrunners really was upsetting. Following Patience, which at least offered an interesting angle on the vampire folklore that the show had done well to avoid, the episode sees a strange alien? parasitic slug with the power of mind control worshipped by a cult of backwoods Christians. Oh, and they think it is the second coming of Christ, but you only find that out in the last couple of minutes. Seriously. There is never any attempt to make sense of this, to explain what the slug is, why anything that is happening is happening, or anything. Even in the show is early years  in fact, especially then  you could expect a little bit more depth, a bit of background, or if not that then the opposite  a bit of mystery, some uncertainty about what this was all about. It is Scully that really kills it though. You could put up with the silliness of the premise, but to have a character who has been developed over a good 7 years as a rational skeptic transformed into a gullible maverick purely for the sake of advancing the plot is bizarre to watch. You feel like you are watching some godawful teen horror, except that it is a woman well into her thirties throwing herself into the kind of creepy isolated community that she is spent the best part of a decade uncovering the sinister underbelly of, being either outwitted by very stereotypical hicks or utterly indifferent to her own safety. Oh, and by the way, Doggett, the new Mudler, is not around. Scully just wandered off into the desert to look into a brutal murder on her own without him. He shows up at the end to save the day  I cannot even remember why  but apart from that, he is not really in it. Again seriously.In short, it feels like either a generic script written for another show, or someones pet movie project which they have been allowed to shove like a mutant leech into the spine of an existing, longrunning show at a time when it was at its most vulnerable. It might have worked on a lesser show, where the characters are more archetypal and the audience expects less. But The XFiles had a good thing going, and Scully was one of the strongest and most idiosyncratic TV characters of the 90s.

What is the question?, then perhaps you should thank God if you have never met a Lacanian. Slavoj Zizek, the most evangelical of Lacanians, would surely exchange the word Jesus in that statement for LacanHegel.Zizeks star burns brightly at the moment, no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption. So it seems impressive when someone  anyone  comes along and says, Hang on, films may say something about ourselves.The ideas Zizek expounds in this film are true purely because he says so. For example, Zizek explains that three Marx Bros are the ego, superego and id God knows what happened to Zeppo, or Gummo \u0085 perhaps they are the sinthome...or is that movies themselves?. This is simply what they are. In Zizeks output, culture is not there to be investigated but merely to be held as an example of his ideology. People may object that he certainly has something to say  but how different is what he says from the Christian attributing everything to Gods will?What is wrong with taking examples, from films or anywhere, to illustrate theory? Well, nothing at all. As Zizek seems to believe, they may even serve as a proof. However, it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context. Without context, you can say and prove anything you want. For Zizek, Lacan is the answer \u0096 so he goes and makes an example of it. Everything but everything resembles the teachings of the Master and culture is there to bear this out, to serve this ideology. For instance, Zizeks exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in Vertigo when Jimmy Stewart spies on Kim Novak in a flower shop. But, in the context of the film, this is not a voyeurs fantasy position at all. Stewart has been deliberately led there by Novak. This presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout Zizeks two hour and a half cinematic sermon.His analysis of the baby wants to f scene in Blue Velvet is laughable. Touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific to the masculine truth of feminine jouissance, Zizek says that Isabella Rossilinis character not only demands her degradation but is, unconsciously, in charge of the situation. This is an example of her jouissance. Well ... possibly. But  sorry to be prosaic  where is the evidence for this? In the film, she partially undergoes her humiliations because Hopper has kidnapped her son. Zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with Kyle MacLachalan. But this may be due to any number of things. Is not that the point of socalled feminine jouissance? According to Lacan, feminine jouissance, unlike phallic jouissance, cannot be articulated, it is beyond the phallic capture and castration of language. If this is right, then no example can be made of it. It also means that the entire concept is nonsensical and entirely mystical. It can only be designated by dogmatists such as Zizek There is feminine jouissance for you! Why is this feminine jouissance? Because I say so. What example can really be garnered from these films? Only Zizeks psychology. Why does he keep inserting himself into his favourite films, even to the point that, when in a boat on Botega Bay, he says he wants to f Rod Steiger too? Is this not the wishfulfilment of someone who spends his life critiquing films? As the saying goes, Freud would have a field day with The Perverts Guide to the Cinema  but with Zizek himself, nobody else.Zizeks theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it, but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws. This film illustrates how Zizek desires and only extremely vaguely  as to be almost useless  how the rest of us desire. For, as any psychoanalyst knows, how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated  and cannot be easily universalised, if at all. Zizeks love of making everything an example of Lacans Answer bears this out how do we desire? like this, this is how I do it. Problem is, in Zizeks desire, everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire. But Zizek is a Leninist and they certainly do not like letting the subject speak for itself.The Perverts Guide to the Cinema is a summation Zizeks love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political what dogma is not?. Zizek has never questioned exactly what his motives might be when embarking on an analysis, what he is trying to discover, because the terms of his exploration, and therefore his ethics in doing so, are never put into question.Zizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing. He is a kind of Henry Ford of cultural theory massproduction and any colour as long as it is black. He is perfect for todays highly consumerist society supposedly critical while giving people the same cap over and over and pretending that it is something different. This is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems  which capitalism always claims to provide  rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all. Which is kind of like being brain dead. For me, Zizeks third Matrix pill is a suicide capsule.PS I loved Zizeks solemn remark  presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity  that music in films can greatly affect peoples sympathies. Did this only occur to Zizek after he watched Jaws?","label":0},{"index":6244,"txt":"This movie is all ultralightweight fluff, predictable from beginning to end. As a Don Knotts vehicle, The Incredible Mr. Limpet was much better, with Knotts character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant. His performance there was toned down, with none of his trademark goggleeyed stare, although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish. Knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile, much as Bob Denver did. Neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles, assuming they were simply typecast. It was probably because of the slouch, the wild stare and the highpitched voice. John Ritter, whom Knotts worked with in Threes Company, was able to transcend his genre, branching out successfully into dramatic roles like The Dreamer of Oz, but the closest Knotts ever got was a small role in Pleasantville. Even Leslie Nielsen was a bad fit here, uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in Airplane! and Police Squad.There is also no way the then43 yearold Knotts could pass for a 35 yearold, as his character insisted he was. It was as ludicrously unbelievable as Tom Hanks at 38 playing the collegeage Forrest Gump.The film was clearly made on a shoestring budget, very much looking like a hastilyfilmed TV episode. It is especially evident in the exterior scenes of the town where Roy goes after he is fired. It is unlikely even a preschooler would be fooled by the Mayberrylike soundstage artificiality.Even viewing this strictly as a childrens movie, it is very disappointing. It is not because it lacks action or special effects, although it does. The pace is much too slow, the situations repetitive. How many times can you watch Roy getting onto a bus? A comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap, with breakneck gags, otherwise you risk boring them and any adults in the theater as well. Movies, even kids movies, have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades. Even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written. Disneys The Love Bug, for instance, at least had some interesting race action.","label":0},{"index":6245,"txt":"After leaving TVs popular The Andy Griffith Show, Don Knotts gave movie stardom a valiant try with a series of inane but matin\u00e9epleasing comedy vehicles.

It is still worth watching but really it is a film that is best enjoyed by children. I would categorize it as 100 familyfriendly and something you could sit down and watch with your kids on a family night.As with all of Knotts films, there is a great cast of beloved character actors and you cannot help but smile when Knotts gives one of his shaky, openmouthed stares, no matter how old and jaded you are.From an adult perspective, one thing I think that is great about this film is how it captures NASA in the 1960s  all the new modern buildings, the hope, the optimism, the future! And I was surprised at how suave and studly Leslie Neilsen was back then. Only complaint about the story is Roys love interest, a rather threadbare, unlikeable woman who cannot give him the time of day until he becomes a big shot  if you are like me, you will be hoping that he gives her the shoveoff at the end.

You already know not to expect a cinematic masterpiece when you see a juicy and proudly promoted title like this and the first impression only gets extra confirmed when noticing the film is a mid80s production from Japan. Now, there are quite a lot of demented and sick filmmakers active in Japan, but Kazuo Komizu surpasses them all with his thoroughly depraved and sickening trilogy revolving on nothing but aggressive sex and the sadistic abuse of young girls. Not even attempting to tell a story, Entrails of a Virgin simply presents a hodgepodge of UNarousing semipornographic sex and truly poor goreeffects that would not even please the most undemanding fan of cheesy 80s horror. Images of a bunch of photographers and their fashion models are inexplicably intercut with scenes of a filthy pervert having crude sex with a seemly underaged girl. He dumps her not even a minute after climaxing typical and she begs him to stay, even if she has to share him with other women. I do not get it. Is this supposed to represent a general male fantasy? Because it is really clich\u00e9d and wrongful. Anyways, back to the bunch of horny photographers and docile models. Surprised by upcoming fog on their way home, the group entrenches themselves in an abandoned country house where they have more appalling sex and eventually fall victim to a ridiculous sexdemon who kills them all. The acting performances are amateurish, the dialogs inane and primitive and Komizus direction is weak and uninspired. I can tolerate all that, including the womanunfriendly portrayal of sex, but I came too close to turning the film off during the indescribably meanspirited wrestling sequence. One of the males brutally hits, kicks and throws around one of the girls and calls her a filthy whore until she literally pees her panties and cries with agony. This sequence is, in my humble opinion, the absolute lowpoint of Asian exploitation cinema.

Without getting too much into plot summary, let us take a quick walking tour of the events. At a secluded cabin, an orgy is in progress, which includes topless wrestling and diaper ping. A vanload of latecomers joins the orgy in progress, but they have unwittingly been followed by a monster I like to call the muddy ninja. This monster precedes to slay orgy participants one by one, except the proverbial virgin if you do not count oral sex who receives his seed and consequently becomes so passionate with desire that she masturbates with someones severed hand. Finally she has her guts pulled out, and then there is a scene which seems to imply that she is pregnant with a baby muddy ninja. Got all that?

Turns out it is way too sleazy for its own good, or bad, or whatever. There is a problem and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust, similar to this in many respects in not having balance to the sex and violence. Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno, and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies! And with the killing scenes, there has to be at least a little tack, and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity, in creating the creaturekillerwhatever. Entrails of a Virgin has neither. It is safe to say it is a pretty soulless movie, even if is not one of the very worst ever made it is there just for horndog Japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their other heads.In this case, we are given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls, nothing too salacious, and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by A Murderer as he is credited. First off, the director Kazuo Gaira Komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on we get spliced in or phoned in, take your pick clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere. It looks like it is from another movie. Then once settled into the house, there is a wrestling scene that is poorly choreographed and shot yeah, we really need to see him all there, and then on to the rape and killings. First the rape, by the photographers, who promise the girls some jobs for their time. Then the Murderer, who like DAmatos creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial, and who for an unknown reason kills the men andor rapes the women one by one.Now, the latter of those, taken by themselves, should be considered the highlights of the movie. This is like saying, however, that the cro\u00fbtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad. An eyegouging scene, a spike thrown like an Olympic event that scene, actually, is kind of cool, and finally the entrailing of the overly sexcrazed girl, whose inconsequential name I cannot remember. Even this becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title! On top of this, the sex scenes, which become tedious through Gaira and his indulgence in longtakeswithoutcutaways where everything by the Japanese censors is blurred anyway, are dubbed over by the actors you would think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough, hence the need to let them speak for themselves. But the overall feeling from Entrails of a Virgin is that of a lumpy one, where it is just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror watch as the last girl left alive, the virgin of the picture, tries to stop the murderer from getting to her, which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him!

Questions you will be asking yourself throughout the movie.The film first caught my attention while I was cruising the Horror section in HMV. I was tired of all the so called terrifiying Hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different. The cover art for Satans Little Helper immediately caught my attention. As you can see, the image draws you in  it is chilling! I knew it was a straight to DVD release  but I took a chance. I mean, I just seen Boogey Man the night before  so It could not get any worse! After I watched the movie, I was semisatisfied. I loved the plot of the movie. It was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend, so he could kill. In some sick deranged way, he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners  a duo of terror. It was a great idea to set the film on Halloween night. This way, no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid. They would simply think he was his guardian. But, this is also where the plot holes begin to surface.If your son came home with a friend he met trick or treating  that is fine. You would not think anything of it  if he was 9!, or round about the same age as him. If however, he appeared with a strange man in a mask, you would be startled and protective of your child. You would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself. You would ask why he is with your son. He does not know him. You would tell him to please leave. He is not a family friend. He is a stranger. Now, we are supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers. In this case, the mum is completely fine with it. Huh? They never seem to think it is a tad odd that the man does not speak  at all. Gruanted they think it is the daughters boyfriend, but after 10 minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he is not saying a word.The film goes down hill from there. The thing that got me the most was, all the mum said was Do you want some cider?. I cannot count how many times she says this in the movie. It is like, oh you are dying  we have cider though, it is all good!! The movie started promising, and failed to deliver. It was more of a horrorcomedy, and even as that it fails to deliver.

I was going to give it a straight out 1 but it got a couple extra points for the body count. But that would be about it. Let me explain. I paid literally \u00a31 for this DVD in a supermarket because I tend to have a lot of faith in bargain horror flicks, Bmovies especially. But if this film was aiming for B status as I suspect it was for a number of reasons which I will touch on in a sec then it failed magnificently. Not only did it shoot for B and miss, it landed somewhere around F. This film had so many opportunities to be good and it pretty much failed on all accounts. I say above that it is likely this film was aiming for B status and it seems to try and achieve this by trying to blend humour with horror, which can either be very good or very bad. For example, later Freddy films Dream Warriors onwards are all about Freddys style and nosethumbing, which works out great! But this film completely bombed in that respect because the times where they tried to inject humour were mostly just stupid. I will admit though that towards the beginning of the film the humour was good. In fact, for about half an hour I liked this film and was prepared to congratulate myself on another good find. BUT what really killed this film for me was the inappropriate kills. For instance, when Satan smashes the cat against the board and writes boo with it is blood using its body as a brush. Or when Satan slams the door into the helpless disabled elderly woman. Now I am not usually too against senseless kills in filmshey, thats the point, right? But in those two cases I just found it grossly offensive and unnecessary to anything in the filmplot especially. For me, the film went downwards from then on. One major bad point about this film is that I hated every character in it. The kid, Dougie was just ridiculously annoying!!! I am at a loss to explain how he could possibly write off all those bodies and people being killed in front of his eyes as a trick! I mean, come on!!! I completely understand that to be in a horror film a character does have to be somewhat stupid, like running upstairs when you should blatantly be running out of the house screaming for help, but this kid took the biscuit! I wanted to kill him myself by the end of it! It was completely unbelievable and if I had to hear him say duh! one more time I was going to bang my head against a wallbecause thats what watching this film felt like. Why did not i just turn the film off? Mainly because I honestly believe an ending can sometimes redeem a film. But I was wrong in this case. The ending did NOT redeem this film, it further irritated the hell out of me and was inadequate to the plot line. I get it already! The killer is always going to come back dressed as someone else, be welcomed into the house by the stupid kid and go on a killing spree again because no one suspects him in that costume! I GET IT! This film made me physically angry because it was so stupid! And if by some foul mistake you do end up watching this film, watch out for the intestines. Frankly, if that guy actually did have intestines that looked like that, I would be surprised he was not already dead, let alone until someones rips them out and ties them to a chair.In fact, I will even go so far as to say that the only character I liked at all in this film was actually the killer. Purely because when his comedy routine worked, it did work. All in all, the plot line of this film dragged anything that might have been good down. Why was the killer killing? I do not know. I can live without knowing who he actually was, thats fairly typical, but without some kind of motive  hell i do not know, i would settle for him having a bad Halloween as a kid! it just seems more than senseless, just stupid.

The anthology style works well for the producers, because it means that they can hire a bunch of big name actors, employ them for only one week of shooting or so, and then bring in the next big name. So you essentially pay for 6 weeks of movie star salary but get 5 or 6 different names on the marquee. But that is very unfortunate for the audience, because the audience would like to see some scenes with Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, and Ingrid Pitt actually acting together. Instead they are stuck in these vignettes by themselves. So let us take them one at a time, briefly.The first story has Denholm Elliot, who does a really admirable job of trying to bring some dignity to his silly role as a writer terrorized by his own character. Unfortunately the actor who plays Dominic, the source of the horror, Tom Adams, just looks silly which ruins any possible horror. There is some hilarious stuff if you want to laugh at it though, like the scene where Dominic kills Elliots psychiatrist. It is the patented scene where the killer creeps up behind the victim but nobody is watching, so the whole audience is supposed to shout out LOOK OUT BEHIND YOU! The second story is the one with Peter Cushing. God I love that man so much. Too bad so many of his films, like this one, pretty much stink. In the story he is supposed to be pining away for a longlost love, and he sees her likeness in a wax museum. It is a completely predictable story that goes nowhere.Then you have the bit with Christopher Lee, where he plays the father of a little kid who turns out to be a witch. Again this bit could have been fun if it had been played for laughs. But instead we are supposed to be horrified when Lee slaps the child and surprised when she turns out to be evil. The actress, Chloe Franks, was pretty good in that type of Bad Seed role though.The last story is kind of amusing... Ingrid Pitt plays an actress and Jon Pertwee plays an actor who accidentally buys a vampire cape that turns him into a real vampire. That is about all the story has to offer. I was surprised at how bad Ingrid Pitts English is, I guess she must have been dubbed in some of the other films I have seen her in.Not a very memorable film or one that I would recommend to anyone but horror completists.","label":0},{"index":6266,"txt":"The TV guide described the plot of SEVERED TIES as thus   An experiment on a severed arm goes awry  so right away I thought this was going to be about an arm thats got a mind of its own as seen in THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS or THE HAND or someone getting an arm transplant as in BODY PARTS . Both premises are tried and tested , or to be more accurate tired and tested so I was curious as to how the producers would approach the story .

Actually it is not a bad flick by Fangoria films; just there are better ones out there, which are similar in vein. Servered Ties simply lacks it own distinctive style. The oddball nature and unpleasant splatter resembled Reanimator and even a touch of slapstick stuck out like something from Evil Dead 2.The comic story is truly whacked out with it is black humour, but it can get melodramatic and a bit in dry in the fun factor. Surprises do crop up, especially the flicks final outcome. Which is well accepted, as I thought it could have copped out with something more accessible. For a lowbudget production the FX makeup can look rigid and very goofy, but there is some grotesque moments that will make you smile than actually cringe. Even a brush of sexual tension streamlines the story, thanks to Elke Sommers sternly juicy performance as the mother. Oliver Reed is quite humorously deadpan in a wicked sense and he pulls it off extremely well. They were both immensely diverting as the couple you loved to hate. Billy Morrisette is delightful in a erratic performance as Harry.

Both of the films are absurd with poorly written characters and bad voices. The voices could have been done but Frosty returns was worst than this because of the unalike snowman they drew.

The only good thing about this film was Frosty the snowman was alike of the classic 60s and a funny line like when they were talking about things that are not real and then Frosty walks by the window humming, whistling whatever he was doing but everything else was badly written and badly animated and I barely got the plot. I saw the DVD cover at the library about 2 or 3 years ago and the art looked crappy so I did not pick it up until this year because the pictures on the back looked a little touching but I played this film.

Paranoia rules the dark world that these characters inhabit. Everybody is unpleasant, and for no reason.

As my wife and kids cozied up on the couch to watch the movie the expectations were high, but 10 minutes into it my kids were yawning and my wife and I were giving each other the look and rolling our eyes. After 35 minutes my kids were actually asking to go to bed  I guess they were fed up with the insensitive language and pointless, disconnected segments.

Also, the movie crawls along in covering c. 19201939 and then steams through the war years.

The Turkish ambassador is wearing a Fez the red hat, whereas the Fez was banned by Turkey much before the time in which the movie is set.

I suppose the filmmakers meant to show an exotic woman, and sari was what they decided would make her exotic.","label":0},{"index":6282,"txt":"The movies storyline is pat and quaint. Two women travel through the middle east and discover themselves. Unfortunately, if you are looking for a movie about the middle east and central Asia this is absolutely terrible.The producers of the film either did no research or were unbelievably lazy when filming it. To begin with, and most glaringly incorrect, the Nuristanis, as they were known in the thirties, and indeed since the 1890s and their forceful conversion by AbdulRahman Shah of Aghnaistan, were not nomads. In fact they have not been nomads since the Aryan invasions of central Asia over three milenia ago.Second, the city that is filmed as Tehran is not Tehran, which is understandable, however the geography of the area around the city could not be more strikingly DIFFERENT than the city of Tehran, which is surrounded on all side by a large mountain range, which predominates all of the cities views.Third, Persian, despite the fact it is spoken in Iran and Afghanistan, is never heard in movie. When there are native speakers who do not speak in German they speak in Arabic. The Persian guards at the border, in fact, say to each other Ma hadha rujal This is not a man and not in mard nist as it would be in Persian. Also, the love song between the Indian princess and one of the main characters is obviously in Spanish. While talking in the garden one of the main characters says that the Quran uses the words Ferdos and jehaan and makes some reference to drugs afterwords. These words certainly never appear in the Quran as they are Persian for Paradise indeed, Ferdos and Paradise are very distant cognates between our languages and World respectively, though Jehaan is admittedly close to Jehennan which is hell in Arabic. When they encounter the nomads in the desert the language spoken is also Arabic, this despite the fact that there are NO native speakers of Arabic in Iran and Afghanistan and its use is primarily religious, with some use in education at that time.When they are stopped in Iran before they reach the Afghan border the people they encounter are wholly unlike any Iranian group. Their tents are typically bedouin with carpets decorating the walls and a high profile. In Iran it is also extremely uncommon for people to wear Turbans unless they are a cleric. The language spoken is clearly Arabic from the initial greeting of Ahlan wa Sahlan. When they do reach Kabul the desert they find themselves in is sandy, totally unlike the rock dirt that is found in the arid parts of the Hindu Kush mountain range. There is an absence of the light green scrub that covers the ground in the summer and spring. The area is also not wholly consumed by the extreme mountains of the mountain range that won its name, The Indian Killers, because of its difficult and limiting ground.In short, the story line is the only thing in this movie that holds any water and it is still weak and common place. It lacks any real draw to it, being merely the tale of two women trying to learning about themselves as they get to Nuristan, however, even that is stillborn and no real development is felt, leaving the characters in the end just where they were in the beginning and nothing has changed except that world war two has broken loose.

I know top 50 does not sound too impressive, but I have seen a lot of really weird films with lunatic plots. I was prepared from something convoluted, because the film was directed and cowritten by Alberto De Martino, who was one of Italys most ambitious and creative but sadly underrated film makers. De Martino steals multiple ideas from successful blockbusters, like most Italian directors did around that time, but he always adds a lot of stuff to make it even more complex, confusing and overwhelming. Not all of De Martinos films are worthwhile, but some of them are extremely underrated, like A Special Magnum for Tony Saitta, Holocaust 2000 and Formula for a Murder. The concept of Miami Golem contains elements from numerous great SciFi and adventure flicks like Alien, Starman , Close encounters of the Third Kind, ET, \u0085 but I would not exactly call it a ripoff. The only thing that is really shamelessly stolen from another film is the opening synthesizer theme song that sounds almost identical to Harold Faltermeyers Axel F. from Beverly Hills Cop. The rest of the film is an amusing hodgepodge of fantasy, SciFi, action, horror and superheromovie gimmicks. It certainly does not always make sense most of the time it does not, actually but Miami Golem is undeniably an imaginative and multifaceted film that kept my mate and I fascinated from start to finish.The plot is extremely difficult to briefly summarize but I will try anyway. Sceptical journalist Craig Milford is reporting the story of a German scientist who allegedly discovered extraterrestrial DNA inside a crashed meteorite and managed to clone it. The DNA cell belongs to an evil alien force that already exterminated another interstellar race in the past and it will unquestionably destroy the whole of mankind as soon as it grows large enough in size. If this is not problematic enough already, the rich Mr. Anderson ordered to steal the slowly growing evil fetus because he thinks that he can manipulate it and use it to obtain world domination. With the help of some good aliens in an earthly disguise, Craig Milford has the difficult task of safeguarding the planet from the evil fetus. Okay, I know all this sounds grotesque and silly, but I assure that Miami Golem is in fact a lightheaded and easy digestible flick. The first half of the film may come across as overly hectic and confusing, because Alberto De Martino attempts to keep the plot secret through the use of preposterous red herrings. There are subliminal ghostly appearances, supportive characters behaving exaggeratedly mysterious for no real reason and at a certain point there are even speculations about the lost continent of Atlantis. This is all misleading padding material, however, and as soon as the setup is more or less clear Miami Golem turns into an ordinary early 80s popcorn action movie with bloody massacres, flamboyant chase sequences in the Florida Everglades!, explosions, gratuitous sleaze and nasty little fetusmonsters in jars.Now, I really do not want to raise the impression that Miami Golem is a lost and undeservedly obscure gem of Italian exploitation cinema. Make no mistake, this is a pretty bad movie! The events only become endurable if you accept the stupidity and incoherence of the plot and if you do not succeed in that, well than this is just a nonstop spitfire of negative aspects. The acting performances are painfully awful. Particularly Bmovie veteran John Ireland, as the archetypal James Bond villainous character, does not seem the least interested in the script. You can tell from his grimaces and by the way he delivers his lines that he also thinks the whole production is retarded and simply signed up for the paycheck. Laura Trotter is probably the least sexy female lustobject ever, and the person who drew the marvelously chaotic VHS cover must have felt exactly the same way, because the ravishing girl on the cover does not appear anywhere in the movie. What an embarrassment this must be for Mrs. Trotter. Still, her completely gratuitous nudity sequences compensate for this, as she is quite hot from the neck down. And, finally, there is the unforgettable scene where David Warbeck takes down a helicopter from a moving school bus with a regular pistol!

So Craig and his new female psychic partner, Joanna Fitzgerald, who can communicate not only with human being but also with alien friends of the creature, begin to find the creature and try to send it to an alien spaceship...

Sister Mary was an exaggeration, a lampoon, a bitter satire of a serenely confident, doctrinaire and highly judgmental nun  and as played by Lynn Redgrave, she was hilarious. But the movie insists that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously  while, as mentioned, maintaining the same tone in the explains it all scenes. The two approaches clash headlong and in the last twenty minutes, the movie goes off the track, plunges into the gorge, and explodes. There are no survivors. It could have worked, if the tone of the scenes with the four former students, and their encounter with Sister Mary, been pitched the same as the Sister Mary scenes.

However, that kind of heightened reality rarely works on film, and it certainly does not here.Director Marshall Brickman has assembled a fine cast who do great work, but by presenting all this absurdity in a realistic fashion the comedy becomes tragedy and you are left with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach.Seek out a production of the stage play instead, you will not be disappointed.","label":0},{"index":6295,"txt":"A lessthansubtle poke at the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church is given a darker shade of death near the end of the show.

To celebrate her schools 25th anniversary, she invites her first students to return and perform their Christmas pageant.However, when the quartet update their play to parody Sister Marys fallacious teachings, the nun is pushed over the edge, sending the story spiralling into a chain of unhappy events.

On the one hand, we are offered a tough outward shell, a story that does not only derive the Catholic Church, but does so foolishly, and uninformed. On an inner layer, we are offered a story of orthodoxy over orthopraxis, and what happens when people follow blindly a faith that they must not understand.At first glance, it appeared this was supposed to be a comedy. If so, then Mr. Durang needs to open a dictionary, because he clearly does not know the meaning of the word. The jokes are pale; the humor is awkward and poorly delivered. In particular, Ms. Keatons performance is flighty and over the top, well below the quality of her Annie Hall and Sleeper days. Jennifer Tilly is again the model of stridence, with her hipitched voice and whining style. All of this could be forgiven if it were not for the last 20 minutes of this movie, that evidently was a controversial play made in 1981.Careful, spoilers aheadIt all starts with the appearance of four former students of Sister Mary Ignatius Ignatius, by the way, is a male name, and a nun would not adopt it after her vows under any circumstance simply due to that fact, just to show you how much tireless research went into the project to begin with. When they all admit that they do not live up to the churchs teachings, the sister proceeds to become irrational and abuse them in a manner the audience is to believe she did way back when in the corny, alltooclich\u00e9 sepiatone flashbacks. When one of them admits to having two abortions, the nun becomes even more abusive, until the pupil pulls out a gun. After wrestling it away from her, the nun kills the pupil, presumably in selfdefense. She then goes on a screaming rampage, killing a gay former student because of his sins. The last shot is of the dead female pupil lying in a Christlike pose as a shadow of a cross hangs over her. Can you say heavy handed? I knew you could!I know there have been abusive nuns in the past, and I know many people have been emotionally harmed as a result, but this imagery is fed down our throats in almost every other shot in this train wreck of a movie. I have heard from the writer and the director that this is a film about hysteria and why one should not follow the orthodoxy so religiously, no pun intended. This explanation is hard to swallow, though, simply because we are never given an authoritative viewpoint that is not biased against the catholic faith in one way or another. This film is simply antiCatholic tripe, which in the name of fairness and equality, is mean spirited and hateful.This is a film I would recommend for a catholic, namely to awaken him or her to the realities of what cynicism and ignorance they face today. If it were Rabbi Ray explains it all or Imam Muhammad explains it all, there would be rioting in the streets and Showtime would lose all of its subscription. But, sadly, because this is a film that strikes out against what is perceived to be the majority, it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same spiteful point of view.I certainly hope every member of that cast was a practicing catholic, so it was not just ignorance that brought them to make this film.I give it 1.5 stars out of 5, not because of its offensive nature, but because it was poorly written, poorly directed and just a bad movie in general.

But only today I went through the trouble of registering on the site, just so I could give this movie the lowest possible rating. I have seen hundreds of films, some of them bad, a few awful. Never, though, have i seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence, of high intentions and failure.Mira Sorvino is horribly cast as the princess, but entirely unbelievable as Phocion, a young boy. Fiona Shaw is always an entertaining character, but the dialogue in the film is much worse, even, than in the insipid French play that is the source Marivaux never reached Hollywood until now, and we should keep it that way.To illustrate, for example, that Leontine is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from beaker to beaker, shouting out names of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is played even sillier. For this, the pair should receive a joint Clair Danes award, which in a just world would be awarded for gratuitously anachronistic and uninspired reinterpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats of the 1990s see Miss Danes in Les Miserables.Aside from the atrocious plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming. For example, there are moments when a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action, sitting in chairs, watching the principal characters. The Director wants us to realize she is adapted a play. I get it. But it does not happen at all until far into the film. At that point, seeing a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment, then disappearing, is creepy and distracting. They are like some sort of unscary zombie crowd, appearing through the mists, filling us with dread. When you see the horrible frolic and song that ends this movie, you will want to rouse your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the grave injustise of poisoning your mind for 112 minutes.Matthew McGuire","label":0},{"index":6323,"txt":"Triumph of Love is proof that not every Com\u00e9dieFran\u00e7aise author who uses crossdressing disguised courtship like Shakespeare is worth seeing.

While Mira Sorvino has fun dangling three mixedup romances, her pants role was not even up to Cherubino in Marriage of Figaro.The herkyjerky editing is annoying and just seems to indicate that a lot of takes were needed for each long speech.Best was Fiona Shaw as the fooled spinster, as well as the costumes.The glimpses of audience we see and the closing curtain call to wink that this is all artifice does not really help.originally written 5292002","label":0},{"index":6324,"txt":"I do notknow... maybe it is because I am Brazilian but all that stuff was too much.

Hickey, however his joy could be short lived as Eddie is involved in an accident  is run over by a car. Taken to the nearest hospital it does not look good for poor Eddie so his uncle Eddie convinces his brother Richard to let him save Eddie with the serum he has developed, a serum which will give the recipient the power to self heal any sort of wound or illness. Desperate for his boy to live Richard agrees but the procedure has unwanted side effects like turning Eddie into a brain eating zombie which is just not a good thing...Executive produced, written  directed by Steve Franke I will be perfectly frank myself  say Serum is awful, Serum is one of those no budget horror films which tries to ripoff other any number of others  ends up being slightly more fun than having you fingernails pulled out with pliers. The script is terrible, it has the whole ReAnimator 1985 feel to it with mad scientists wielding huge syringes trying to eradicate death but it is so boring it is untrue, the first forty minutes is nothing more than a really dull soap opera that amounts to nothing expect to pad the running time out with Eddie arriving home after spending some time away  finding his exgirlfriend has hooked up with someone else, arguments with his stepmom, getting drunk with his mate  generally boring the audience stiff. So, once the tedium of the first forty minutes is over  if your still watching it it takes another twenty minutes to get Eddie reanimated  then he kills a couple of people, police catch up with him  shoot him, the end. Thank god. Serum is devoid of any of the characteristics that one would associate with a good film, the characters suck, the dialogue is poor, it takes itself far too seriously, it is dull, it is slow, it is forgettable  considering it is meant to be a horror film there is an alarming lack of blood, gore or horror. Not recommended, did I mention Serum was boring? I thought so.Director Franke does nothing to liven this thing up, although competent there is no style here at all. The gore levels are none existent, there is a bit of splashed blood, a bitten neck, a couple of scars on a dead womans face, a couple of scenes where a needle pierces skin  that is it. Do not expect a ReAnimator in the gore department because if you do your going to be sorely disappointed, much like I was in fact. Filmed in what looks like one house, one restaurant  a lab the film has no variety either  just looks cheap throughout. There is a couple of scenes of nudity but that is nowhere near enough to save it.Technically the film is not too bad, at least it looks like proper cameras were used, I cannot really comment on the special effects because there are not any but generally speaking Serum looks reasonably professional. Apparently shot in Texas, or should that read it should have literally been shot in Texas? The acting sucks although again I think they were proper actors rather than friends or family of the director.Serum is a terrible film, it is dull, slow, boring, has no gore  feels like a horrible soap opera for the first forty minutes. I do not understand why anyone would feel the need to watch this when they can watch ReAnimator or one of it is sequels again instead, seriously I recommend you give Serum a miss. There I have just saved you from wasting 90 minutes of your life, you can thank me later.","label":0},{"index":6326,"txt":"Dr. KDavid H Hickeyhas been trying to master a formula that would end all disease and handicaps, but needs live donors to complete his work.

The story is very similar; a mad doctor develops a serum that he believes will alleviate pain, sickness and death, but he is apparently not a big believer in clinical trials and so winds up with a braineating zombie on his hands in the person of his nephew. The zombie even looks like one of those from Reanimator, and in fact some of the makeup effects in Serum are not bad. Unfortunately, the script is pretty slow and unbelievable in quite a few places, resulting in a soap opera feel for most of the first 34 of the movie. For some reason, the director feels compelled to tell us the time of day every few minutes by flashing it in big white letters across the screen. I cannot see why this was important, other than being an attempt to provide viewers with a sense of time passing; sometimes, that would not be present otherwise as the plot plods along.There are a number of moments that just do not add up here. For instance, one victim is bludgeoned with a sledge hammer, but when we see the victims head up close, there is no sign of that trauma. In another scene, a character runs down a fully lit hospital corridor we can see the circles of light on the floor, in fact with a flashlight in hand, looking for all the world like he is walking in the dark... but a moment later a second character walks down the same fullylit corridor without one. These are just a couple of examples; moments of what look like directorial or editorial sloppiness crop up quite frequently throughout the movie.Serum is better in some ways than much of what goes straighttovideo as independent horror lately. In terms of technical items \u0097 sound and photography, for example \u0097 it is got a more polished look than a lot of what lands on a DVD. On the other hand, there is still a good deal of wooden acting particularly by one of the lead characters, the mad scientist himself! and nonsensical moments that have nothing to do with suspension of disbelief and everything to do with writing and continuity. Maybe these are things that the people involved with making this film will eventually get more experience with, though. One of the problems with lowbudget independent horror lately is that the filmmakers often set out to remake more popular movies that had bigger budgets, and that almost never works out. It did not in the case of Serum, anyhow.","label":0},{"index":6329,"txt":"Yes there are worse movies out there.

If this is an attempt to show that she does not need a man to protect her than wuss man is superfluouse to the film and ought not to be in it at all. It has no suspense, no character development, and an heroine that could be outsmarted by a rotton onion.  I think she flushes her wedding ring on a boat with a self contained tank rather than just dropping it overboard in the ocean where her body should be anyway and after the husband finds her, demonstrating that she is a moron, she still makes childish assumptions that lead to almost getting her killed.

Well, as the summary says I was mislead. This film was nothing like The Burning Bed, which had power and Farrah played the part of a woman you truly felt for, and felt her pain and her need to survive. Sleeping with the Enemy drifted off after the first act into cheap thrills with Roberts faking her death to escape her husband and goes to live in Iowa. Her husband at first believes she is dead but starts to grow suspicious that she may still be alive and sets off after her. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game with Julia getting a house in this small town in Iowa and changing her identity....there is no mention of course how she got the money for this but at this point in the film I did not care all that much. She meets a guy Mr. Nice wimpy and falls for him and her husband does finally catch up to her but not before he rearranges her soup cans and straightens up the kitchen. This was I assume to provide a cheap thrill to the audience. But I did not care much if she was an abused wife because the film as I have said cheated the audience. If it had stayed the course I might have felt for her and her situation. Of course the husband is killed and all is well for little ol Ms Roberts.

Her brother comes back from the Eastern Front, he has received a Ritterkreuz which he is showing in some scenes. So he is a war hero and still a fine man who preserved his conscience.

I will not get into specifics, as I do not want to write a spoiler, but the idea of grown, professional, British men getting into near death scraps every weekend is, well... funny. And this film is not. The fighting, the idea of fighting, is taken far too seriously. The gravity of the pugilism, the reverence with which the subject matter is treated becomes irritating, as it neither establishes or resolves the conflict. It seems as though the plot, with holes big enough to drive a Guiness truck through, has been slapped together with a contrived fish out of water theme so that viewers can gaze into Woods teary eyes as he learns how to become a man ie. hitting other young men of opposing football tastes with blunt objects and then running away as fast as he can. The characters are cartoonish, especially the Americans at Harvard. The character development and story line are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the picture. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film does not reach its height until nearly the end, which by then you will have spent nearly two hours of your life you are never getting back.

Tottenham are in town already.. they are part of the town, they do not have to go there! And if Tottenham fans wanted to fight other fans the last place on earth they would do it is Bank station, where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world.There are several other similar errors but the biggest failing for me is the actor who plays the lead hooligan. He clearly decided it was not worth trying to speak with an East End accent and instead opted for a Dick Van Dyke style mockney which made my ears bleed.

I felt I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point out a few things.a People just do not talk like that in London in real life; the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it sound stupid. Unfortunately hooligan types do exist, but those you see in Green Street are more like parodies. b The actor who plays Pete Dunham Charlie Hunnam unfortunately sounded about as English or Cockney as Osama Bin Laden. He is from up north in Newcastle and I am just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him  how are we supposed to take him seriously. Why they did not just get someone from East London to play that part is beyond me. I could have done a bang up job myself, hehe. c Mr Frodo.

It may do a little better in the states because the Americans just wont know or care how inaccurate it is. Please my American and foreign friends, do not believe a word of this nonsense.

Fair enough, the storyline is quite decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed  with a decent ending i might add. But the film on the whole is poor, seriously poor. As people have been mentioning the accents should not spoil a film  i disagree  either a simple casting error, or a lack of effort in coaching the voices caused the film to be irritating all the way through  it was obvious from scene one some AmericanGeordie was playing the role. Do not get me wrong, good looking guy, who looks great with a skin head  but no not a football hooligan. I could go on forever about how ridiculous the football scene was  the fake steward situation. Also, when the GSE are going to play United up north, they go on the train expecting only 3 of them  does not make any sense  this a real organisation of gangsters and thugs, which is portrayed in the film to be some mickey mouse cult of about 5 people. In terms of accuracy  did West Ham and Milwall not play for the last couple of years they have been in the Championship together? Hmm, ten years OK. And I am sure Bother would be able to just waltz into a Milwall firm pub. Basically, a very poor film which people will like if they have little knowledge of real football, and hooliganism.

The fact that it has a flimsy storyline is bad enough, that they have hooked it around the subject of football violence makes it 100 times worse.I had severe doubts about the premise of this film even before I started watching, but went into it open minded enough even to accept the way that the writers saw fit to introduce Elijah Woods character Matt into the hooligan scene.But the film throws up inaccuracy after inaccuracy, to the point that by the middle of the film each one makes you cringe harder than the time before.Let us clear up a few things Hooligans do not tend to virtually smash up their own pub before a runofthemill league game; they do not set out to kill each other; they do not ONLY wear Stone Island and others in the crowd, hooligans or not, do. They most certainly do not, when having taken exception to a new firm member, trot off to their rival firms territory for pie and mash. And I would love to meet the hool who would go and grass on his firms top boy to the rival firm. Although you can scratch what I said about setting to out kill each other if one does exist.Do not get me wrong,I am yet to see a film on the subject that does not contain some fantasy whims, but this is on a par with The Firm for cluelessness.I found it ironical that Woods American nemesis is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user, when this is part and parcel of the British hooligan scene. The film chooses not to challenge Woods morals and instead steers clear of any of the firm using coke.I could go on, but I think I have made my point.As for the plot, it is highly unimaginative, and I am sure if I had not spent the entire film bemoaning the points, and more, made above then I would have guessed what was going on sooner than I did. And believe me, I was well in front.I get the distinct impression this film is aimed at men, with the hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional issues that are raised.If I am right, then the makers have failed completely. It is too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene, and I cannot believe the kind of female who looks for emotive films would give a damn about any of the characters given their violent tendencies.Are there any good points? Maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but I am rarely impressed by slowmo action, certainly not when it is a fight as the point is a ruck is rousing enough anyway.There are some funny, if unrealistic moments. Woods trip to school did raise a smile for me. But a few mildly funny moments hardly make up for watching two hours of complete fabricated dross.If you are British avoid like the plague, if only not to further develop misconceptions of the scene if you are not in the know. If you are American, you may enjoy it, as it is clearly tailored to the market. But no one can deny the plot is flimsy, predictable and ultimately over the top.","label":0},{"index":6340,"txt":"Green Street, as it was called in the UK, or Hooligans is a bad film. The story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in England, has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately.My first main gripe with Hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters. Do not get me wrong, I like Elijah Wood and have a great respect for his work, but despite his best efforts he struggled to pull off this role. The main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal, however he spends much of the film placid and cheery, only displaying his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film. This linked with his looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans. At no point during the film was I convinced that a he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b the firm of thugs would accept such a person into their fold.The other main character is played by Charlie Hunnam. Charlie looks the part, and is fairly convincing as a thug. Unfortunately, being a native of Newcastle Upon Tyne in the North of England, he demonstrates the worst East London accent since Dick Van Dyke tried to go cockeny in Marry Poppins. Details such as this probably will not bother an American audience who will be less attuned to regional dialect in the UK, but being from the UK it was a problem I could not ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me. The supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast, especially the role of Bover. The lad playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that Charlie played. With a film like this, you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible, unfortunately, the casting failed. Imagine if you made a film like The Godfather and had Sean Hayes Jack from Will and Grace playing Michael Corleones part. You would not be convinced. The story in Hooligan is also full in implausibilities. I am no football Hooligan, but I am a fantatical football fan. I know how cliquey a group of regular football supporters can be, as such it deem it impossible for a nonfootball fan, who is not a fan of the club in question, is not from the area in question and not even of English nationality to be embraced by a firm who equate to a secret organisation in some severe cases. My final, and biggest, problem with this film, is the way it portrays football hooligans. I take objection to the films idea that despite being very violent individuals, hooligans are excused as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other. This is complete rubbish. Football hooligans are complete scum. They take football, the national sport of England and use it as an excuse to terrorise, frighten and intimidate people. They only represent a tiny percentage of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation. They are not brave or loyal, they are cowardly and evil. If the GSE in this film truly loved their club, West Ham, why would the devote their lives to being a stain on its name. Hooligans are an embarrassment to football and to English society. Football hooligans do for the reputation of football what Hitler did to the reputation of Germans. Although this film triesintends to show the gritty side of football violence. It does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme fans of the sport. It does not show the poor innocent bystanders at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing coinslightersglass into the crowd. It does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with graffiti and broken windows. It does not show the REAL fans of football clubs who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches or abroad to European games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone.

Maria Schraders acting is dreadful, never seeming to mean what she says, or even knowing what she says until she says it. She showed no genuine emotion at all, not for her beloved goy, or her mothers story. When with Lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in Lenas story. There never seemed to be a real relationship between Lena and her mother except her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding, which is not much. The supposed parallel between Hannahs mixed romance and her mothers relationship with her father was as clich\u00e9 as they come, and failed miserably anyway. The wedding was completely unconvincing and a dumb finish. The climax of the protest was uninspiring, and no matter what Lena had or had not done to influence the outcome, she would surely have shown some complexity of feeling at the time, a haunted look, an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, none of the characters in the film had any depth or spark. It was very hard to care about any of them, even little Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. Why did she dis him so when on the phone from the hotel? There was no context or explanation whatever for that. If every reference to him was removed it would not be noticed. A simple story made confusing by poor character development who was whose mother, again?? weak acting, and directing that made everyone look like they were acting.

I do not mean that the story was complicated, but the entire plot is based on one thing a couples desperate and expensive unsuccessful attempts to conceive children. People who tried that hard must have forgotten of the option of the adoption, to which this movie is not kind to.Lauren Holly plays Jennifer Robertson, a complete contradiction to anything offered by the womens liberation movement, exhibiting almost no sense of independence. She is quite a boring character as the dreamy housewife with absolutey nothing else on her mind but to have kids. Like a dumb 50s romance comedy, Greg Kinnear is her submitting husband who likewise displays no personality, no independence, and from us, no interest.They are the two most boring and often annoying characters, and they hardly make for topics of a comedy that should present itself with many mishaps, which should arise from a couple doing all they can to get pregnant. Except, they really do not do anything except go to a fertility clinic and shell out a whole lot of money to do what they could do in the privacy of their own except for that in vitro fertilization number. The plot hardly allows for any mishaps, because well, the couple do not do anything to create any sort of bizarre situation. They just go to this clinic. So what?The subplots are meant to test the faithfulness of the couple, a necessary moral element of the story since the couple does plan on conceiving children together. Jennifer works at a new age shop with her friend played by Joan Cusak, and they are in the business of developing aphrodesiacs. Christopher MacDonald plays the intrested buyer and Jennifer is the promising negotiator of a pretty price for her and her friends product. The subplot hardly offers much to keep you interested although Joan Cusak is pretty funny in the restaraunt scene.Danny Kinear is an architect, who finds an opportunity to make some extra money to cover the clinic bills, by taking on a job in Seattle, where his boss is the crass seductress also another hopeless, helpless female character who tries to influence Danny as dumb as he is to have an affair with her once things are conveniently rocky with him and his wife for reasons I do not care to give away. Jill Hennesy is good in the role, but her character is too predictable, and too formulaic as a much needed element to create conflict for Danny. It is stupid and once again, hardly interesting. The overall movie itself is utterly boring, and hardly funny at all save the restaraunt scene and the airline flight. The plot offers nothing that is really attentiongrabbing. Even if the story was entirely about two people trying to conceive, the writers could have figured out several hilarious mishaps to develop out of that. Second, the main characters are completely boring. They are complete silouhettes of dumb 1950s comedies with happy wife and clueless husband. So, even without mishaps present in the plot, the characters themselves offer nothing interesting, let alone funny.Joan Cusak should have been in the lead and someone else should have taken Kinnears part.

Also, Cate and Heaths love seems very incestuous. They seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers. I do not understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof.I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films, but like I said, it is extremely hard to like any of the characters. Katherine Heigls performance was horrid which was a complete shocker. She was terrible at being the bitchy older sister of Edward, and there just was not enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me even to critique her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky, he was the only person I sympathized with.

It ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are in essence unlikeable, mostly unsympathetic, and frequently cruel to one another. It changes the very nature of certain characters Isabelle, for instance, in the novel, had not a conniving bone in her body they have stripped her blind idealism and turned her into a scheming whore. Heathcliff is an awful person who psychologically tortures most people in his path, but in this version Catherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care. The dialog is trite and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver any of it with straight faces. In place of depth or actual emotions, we know they mean something when they scream it in someones face. I have read criticism of the early 90s version, Emily Brontes Wuthering Heights which featured Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, saying that it turned an intensely dark, Gothic story into a sudsy bodiceripper.

By god is it AWFUL. The main girl is pretty mediocre, but when compared to the rest of the cast she is Maryl Streep. The main Hero, Heath, is just plain awful. He can sing decent sounding clich\u00e9d songs, but that is about it. His acting broke the sad moments by being so bad at points that I just burst into laughter. The Isabel girl was pretty godawful too, and the brother was just a flat character that was played by an actor that could not display emotion whatsoever. And when he tried to, it failed miserably. Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor, playing Edward, although it is obvious the direction was bad because even he did not live up to what I have seen him do. Oh, and the father was not halfbad to my memory, but he was in the movie for such a small amount of time I can hardly remember.The story itself was not very good. More breakups than you can imagine. Predictable story Until the ending, which I barely understood. EXTREMELY onesided characters with no real depth to them... Overall just not interesting or compelling, nothing we have never seen before done MUCH better, and nothing worth watching here.The ending is suppose to be a tearjerker. It did nothing of the sort.

My theory is that the sound guy got bored and went down to the beach for a few beers with his boom  all I could hear in half the scenes were the waves.

The dialogue of the movie was absolutely horrendous. Unless you are a psychology major, you most likely will not understand most of what is said in the movie, and because of that simply will not care. It became somewhat of a romantic movie with the showing of events happening in the lives and relationship of Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, for as badass as he was in the first movie, seemed to get all religious and preachy. Personally, I do not need to hear about that or pay money to listen to it. The movie was a serious waste of my time, and I do not think I can watch the first one anymore. The dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologues from basically every character made me lose interest in the film quickly, and the small amount of good fighting scenes pushed me nearer the edge, and the ending of the movie shoved me right off.

It was the most spectacular movie ever made. What ever possesed the Wachowski brothers to do this film is beyond me.There is no plot, you cannot argue with that. Basically all this film was was a load of talking, and do not get me wrong, I have no problem with talky films, but all the talking in The Matrix Reloaded was a pointless load of drivvle. Then there would be a fight sequence which lasted WAY too long, then more pointless drivvle, then another fight scene that lasts too long and it all builds up to the biggest anticlimax ever. A little bearded bloke talking a load of uncomprehensible bull for 20 minutes.Also, Keanu Reeves gives his worst performance yet. I knew he was not a good actor but this was beyond a joke. If you watch his films in the order he was in them it would seem he got gradually worse as they went along. God knows what his performance is like in Somethings Gotta Give! Keanu Reeves The only plank of wood ever to become an actor.After the splendor of the first film this came as a massive dissapointment. If you have not already seen the first film I suggest you watch it, but do not waste your time with this utter pile of turd.","label":0},{"index":6373,"txt":"As a fan of Sciencefiction movies, I have been aware of The Matrix since its release in 1999. From the little bit I would allow people to tell me about it, I assumed it was highly original and sophisticated. I am also a devotee of Alice in Wonderland. I could never quite figure out how I missed The Matrix when it was released. With the imminent release of The Matrix Reloaded, it was time to buy the DVD and watch it.The disappointment was too great. The premise of the matrix the controlling device as opposed to the movie was clever. The philosophical premise of parallel worlds, alternate realities is shopworn. However, I could still have bought into the film, as sciencefiction, if it stayed firmly in that genre. Unfortunately, it turned into a standard, will they or will not they escape, break through, rescue those in need of rescue, etc. To make matters worse, it turned out to be another martial arts exercise. The problem is that sciencefiction and martial arts films are really two different types. To the purest, the devotee of one or the other, mixing the two does not work. It is like mixing sciencefiction with romance. You can have one or the other, but not both in the same film, or, at least, not both to the same extent in the same movie.If there were such problems with The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded really compounded the problems. At least thirty minutes of the film were either martial arts sequences or the protracted carchase. This observation ignores the question, made in every professional, negative review of the movie If Neo could do the Superman thing, why bother to fight at all? The answer, of course, is that is what draws the young, male demographic group into the theatre. Then there is the redemption through love aspect. That plot device was worn out by Richard Wagner over a hundred years ago. It was actually handled better by him in Die Gotterdammerung.So where does that leave those who saw the Matrix Reloaded. Martial arts fans probably groaned through the trite, but arcane scifi philosophizing. Science fictions fans were wondering why they were sitting through a kungfun fest. Most of the males in the audience where probably bored by the silly romance aspect of the film.Just what are you supposed to be getting for your bucks when you see The Matrix franchise films Science fiction, martial arts, or soap opera? A bit of each does not make for a whole lot more of any of them, nor for a satisfying film for the afficionados of each.","label":0},{"index":6374,"txt":"I felt asleep, watching it!!! and I had tickets for the midnight premiere Any questions?

By the way what an ending!?","label":0},{"index":6375,"txt":"The Matrix was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its Twilight Zoneish manner. The general rule applies here and this sequel does not match up to its predecessor. Worse than that, it does not even compare with it.Reloaded explodes onto the screen in the most unprofessional fashion. In the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as Trinity is shot in a dream. Immediately after that, the film nosedives. After a disastrous first 45 minutes, it gradually gains momentum when they enter the Matrix and the Agent Smith battle takes place. But it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groanworthy twist at the end. Worst of all is the overlong Zion Rave scene. Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but it is also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music.The bullettime aspect of The Matrix was a good addition, but in Reloaded they overuse to make it seem boring. In the first one there were interesting plot turns, but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting. The movie is basically, just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is. It works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better. It appears that The Matrix franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the Star Wars saga have.The acting standard is poor for the most part. The best character of course goes to Hugo Weavings Agent Smith the only one to be slightly interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo, but in all the special effects, there is little room to make much of an impact. Academy Award Nominee Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue. Carrie Ann Moss part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress. A poor, throwntogether movie, The Matrix Reloaded is a disappointment. Those who did not like the first one are unlikely to flock to it. This ones for diehard fans only. Even in the movies own subgenre of special effect bonanzas Minority Report, The Matrix etc. this is still rather poor. My IMDb rating 4.510.","label":0},{"index":6376,"txt":"What I hate about this show is how poorly the leads are written. These women have no selfrespect or dignity.

Why they would write her and Jenny Garth as vapid, airhead, desperate, men chasing, oldmaid wannabes is beyond me.Their plots and dialog remind me of The Simpons, Homer says whenever his cartoon character Poochie is not on screen, Everyone should ask, where is Poochie?. All the talk centers on whining about some guy, and then whining to some guy. Sometimes they change it up and the guy whines instead. Then they get back together or break up at the end.

Matrix Reloaded proves this assumption wrong.The Matrix worked out better, despite having apparent holes concerning logic of the story. At least nobody could explain to me why beating up a bot aka agent inside a simulation aka martix would harm the responsible computer program in any way...Unfortunately, the Wachowski brothers made excactly this agentbashing the main thing in Matrix Reloaded it is a beat em up orama. This fighting scenes may be work out sufficient or even cool in a 5 sec. trailer, but prolonged for several minutes, apparently being faked, choreographed poorly and repeated over and over again it is nothing more than boring. Despite seeing the promised spectecular stunts there is nothing more than simple lowquality, unimaginative bashing already seen or better not in eg. Van Damme movies. The difference of postproduction etherything is 5 times faster, the camera floats around a lot and freezes on certain scenes, and this is repeated for at least 5min does not help here, all this has nothing to do with the very meaning of martial arts. Beside these fights, all actors do refuse to do what they are payed for acting.What is up besides the fighting scenes? Few except Hollywood routine. This ohsomulticultural bunch of hippies which sucked in Waterworld are recycled as citizen of Zion mans last city on earth, and on the order of Morpheus they start dancing, ecause this is a good opportunity to show a lot of barely covered tits and butts. The ohsopopular clich\u00e9e of the frog aka frenchmen talking with this je ne sais quoi dumb accent, who wastes his fortune because of a liason damour is bravely served. Following this and unwanted funny is the fight between Neo and the sinister followers of the frog, since it takes place in an Erroy Flynn like enterieur, luckily featuring a lot of mideaval weapons for decoration. For Neo posing with the hellebarde, just add 2 stairs and a lot of statues for being destructed, thrown over evil guys and the like and you get 5 more senseless, boring min. of this junk.Whats left to expect?

These elements  coupled by incredible special effects of the day  presented a magical ride that kept you in suspense the entire time. Enter Matrix Reloaded and its sequel, Revolutions. The problem here is not the special effects or the fight sequences as some may argue; The brothers have taken welldeveloped characters from the first film and hollowed them out like rotten tree logs.\u0085 The connection that was first established between viewers and onscreen characters in the first film is lost when you realize these are not the same characters from the first Matrix movie.To wit, Morpheus was developed as a charismatic, philosophical character with insight far exceeding anyone else in the movie, but here in Reloaded  we are presented by a different Morpheus who stands hard and hollow, reduced to corny oneliners that contradict the character we saw develop in the first film. This character just did not feel the same, and this could also be said about the supporting characters in the movie.The removal of Tank was also a disappointment. Tanks involvement in the first film was minimal at best, but he played the role extremely well. In Reloaded, we discover that Tank dies after the events in the first film, and he is replaced by a Jar Jar Binks stunt double that could not act to save his live think stale box of Kelloggs Corn Flakes. His performance left me chuckling throughout, and most of his spoken dialog lacked timing. There was an overwhelming sense that he was either trying too hard to convey his emotions onscreen or the delivery in the script was off; in either case, the experience was humorous! At times I felt embarrassed for the actor....Even Neos Godly persona was suspect during most of the fighting sequences. The alleyway battle with the 200 Agent Smith clones was certainly exaggerated. One must wonder, for a man so gifted as Neo  that he would even waste his time engaging in such a fruitless, frivolous battle when more pressing matters attend especially when you consider his ability to fly or his ungodly ability to bend the Matrix; certainly Neo could have dispatched the clones much quicker, and more efficiently. Again, such acts lend themselves to a script hindered by consistency, and scenes created as filler to keep us from feeling gypped. In jest, our expectations of the characters created in the first film are discarded promptly. Sadly, for those expecting more of the same  you will certainly walk away feeling gravely disappointed.However, if you take Reloaded as your standard, runofthemill action movie, and forget the incredible story inconsistencies and the untwining of alreadyestablished character development from the first film, you should walk away feeling quite pleased.","label":0},{"index":6380,"txt":"I tried to remove anything that might be considered a spoiler. I also assume that you have seen the first movie or at least know the general gist, so if you have not some of this might not make sense.Plot This movie beats the audience over the head with tired philosophical ramblings again and again in an attempt to get the theme across. We are bombarded again and again by questions of purpose, and destiny, and choice, and forced to endure the long, torturous platitude sessions that contain them.Neo, awakened from a dream in the last movie, now begins a period of realization about his own existence. There are a lot of revelations in this movie, which I will be vague about so they will not seem like spoilers.If you are still worried vague references will spoil the movie, do not read the paragraph below.The strength and weakness of faith is revealed. The strengths and weaknesses of love, and its temporary nature, are also revealed. The interdependence of humans and technology, and our faith in technology, are also revealed. The importance of choice and experience is revealed. Explaining further things that are revealed would go into too much detail, so I will refrain as the guidelines for writing a commentary asks. Btw, by revealed I mean pounded through our ears and eyes like nails.Storyline So how does Neo and the gang get from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next one? In short, they keep the faith, and use and abuse overlystylized action and bullettime like it is going out of style and after this display, I am hoping moviegoers and makers alike learn to appreciate subtlety and originality a bit more. More on that later. To not spoil anything, I will say no more than the promo material already did Neo is still trying to figure out the Matrix, and he is looking for answers while trying to save the humans, and Zion, all while baddies are going after him and his cohorts. The movie pretty much picks up where the last one left off.Action While martial arts action and gunplay peppered its predecessor in somewhat equal parts, this movie focuses much more on martial arts than gunplay, adding swords, sais, etc. to the mix. Special effects are so often used and waved in the audiences face that it becomes really tiresome. I have discussed this movie with friends and coworkers alike, and nearly all of them found some of the action sequencesespecially the Smith fight we all heard would be in the movieto be too long and tedious. This is a huge red flag for action fans, because the end of an action sequence should either leave you wanting a slight bit more, or completely content with the awesomeness that just occured.These fights scenes do neither. They are overstylized, overthetop sequences that are wooden and uninspired. In the first movie, there was a real sense of desperation to some of the action, a sense that fighting was for survival, not just looking good which I honestly do not think they manage in Reloaded anyway in black and leather. Go watch Drunken Master or Iron Monkey after this movie to remind yourself of what good fighting sequences areyou will not regret it. In addition, the Matrix abilities people have in Reloaded is not consistent, and what they actually do is not consistent. The first movie had its inconsistencies here, but they were not too glaringunlike Reloaded.Special effects are poured on and on and on. Every little thing someone does, be it just jump, somersault, spin, and in many cases just pose, areslowmoed, bullettimed, or overaccentuated by some sort of destruction. It is evident the W Bros had a ton of money to throw at this movie, and boy did they throw it, with no real restraint. Sharp editors could have really helped this, but the first movie was such a hit that free reign was obviously given, which brings us to. . .Character and dialogue I have already more or less said the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical platitudes. Actors cannot really bring a lot of depth to their character when the script and direction is shoving character progression audiences face, or neglecting it altogether. The audience is at no time given nuance and substance so they can contemplate the character on their own.Keanus acting performance is stiff at best. Keanu is good at acting confused, and that is about all he does in this film. He makes a decent attempt to show passion between Neo and Trinity, but it falls flat.Lawrence tries to make Morpheus everything from Moses to Henry V, and be as cool as a cat throughout. With the script he is provided, he makes a noble attempt, but it also falls flat.Moss is not very believable either. Her look of concern is always the same, much like Keanus, and the chemistry is not there, although in their very physical scenes they fake it well enough.Hugo once again brought his weird sense of being an Agent program, but he too suffered from the scripts hand. I actually find him to be the most interesting character of the bunch, but instead of development they just make him an excuse for a huge, drawn out fight scene.All in all, this movie is beyond disappointing if you had good expectations, and on its own, as a standalone movie which is not how it is supposed to be taken, it is still horrible. I do not see The Matrix as deep, but I at least see it as an enjoyable scifi romp that has some interesting ideas, good action, a few funny lines, and enough restrained symbolism and elusions to amuse the attentive. Reloaded fails on all these counts, and I really hope the W Bros will give us a better experience in the 3rd installment. Granted, I do not have a lot of hope left for that after this film.","label":0},{"index":6381,"txt":"SPOILERS SPOILERS Continued...From here on in the whole movie collapses in on itself. First we meet a rogue program with the indication we are gonna get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and the like. We get a guy with a retarded accent talking endless garbage, two ghosts that serve no real purpose and have no character whatsoever and a bunch of henchmen. Someones told me they are vampires straight out of Blade 2, but they are so undefined I did not realise.The funny accented guy with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as the Oracle, only for far longer and far far worse. He has a simple point about cause and effect, makes it, then continues to make it and make it until it becomes convoluted and stupid. His final line before walking off is comparable to Storms do you know what happens to a toad... line in Xmen in levels of utter bland baddness. The chocolate cake is such a lazy, pathetic cliche and Monica Bellucci as the wife does nothing other than exactly what we expect the moment we see her.And then we get another kung fu fight!!! WHY? Neo is, allegedly, The One. He can do anything. He has the ultimate power and what does he use it for. Kung bloody fu all the time. And while he can stop 1000 bullets, he still gets cut by a sword and still makes a meal of 5 undecipherable henchmen vampires?. I wanted to see mind blowing powers. I wanted to see him do the wildest, craziest most insane s to people because he can do anything. I got the same as before without the wow.The fabled car chase. That cannot be bad. Well... no, it is not. It is just not what we have been tyold it was going to be. ALL the cool shots from this scene are in the trailer. Every one. So all possibly Wow has been taken from us so all we now get is a good chase sequence with, guess what, a kung fu fight!!! OK, it is not Neo, but you would have thought he would have explained to his closest friends about the reality of the Matrix. At least taught them something. It is not hard.Hey, Morpheus, do not worry about what happens to you in the matrix. It is not real. As long as you understand that nothings real then nothing can really harm you.There you go. Simple.OK, so the chase is not bad. It is never boring and it does not seem like 16 minutes. It is just so underwhelming. And still, it gets worse.The final climax to the movie is quite probably the worst imaginable. They have this whole elaborate plan that involves three crews. They then only show it sporadically between Morpheuss over long, super preachy, monologue. To make it worse, they never clearly define what this plan that needs 3 teams is. You know basically, but you do not know who is doing what, when, so when one crew goes down you just do not care and you do not know how this is going to affect what goes on.I will sum it up though, it happens so Trinity can get back into the Matrix to setup the end. That is the only reason it happens. Which raises the question, why did they need to send 6 people originally? Trinity gets in in five minutes by herself!Neos journey to the centre of the Matrix so to speak is handled equally lazily. Ooohhh!!! He runs into another 100 Agent Smiths!!! Woooooo!!! That must have taken a lot of thought. Only now they are in a corridor so the fight has no scale and is over in a moment. Man, what a grand finale!!!And then the Architect!!!Remember everything I said was bad about the Oracle and the foreign guy? Add them together and double it, that is how truly appalling the Architect is. The only reasonable potential of him is he is about to set up the cliffhanging climax.And then he blows it!Let us look at the options he gives Neo. Choose one door and all humanity dies except 27!!!. Choose the other and all humanity dies!!! Considering choice is something this film tries to explore it does not really give it is hero one. If he had a choice of Save humanity and the missus dies or Save the missus and kill humanity there is the potnetial for inner torment and tension. Also, with Trinity being mid fall, the potential of a real cliffhanger that would have made seeing the third more essential. But no. He has save noone or save the missus.Now, the very worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo dying and then coming back to life right at the end. The year it came out everyone was so annoyed by how stupid Jar Jar was they did not notice that the very end of The Matrix made him look him Steven Hawking. The Oracle told me I would fall in love with the One, and I love you.... Come On!!!! How can the whole world have missed how utterly terrible that was?So, what do the Wachowskis do in the sequel? Well, they make the ending of the original look better. How? Well, by doing almost exactly the same thing again only swapping characters only so much worse I think my f a and r keys would be worn out if I kept writing far before I got to worse.And the cliffhanger is just not really a cliffhanger. It is a reminder.Basically, this film is just bad. I really did not want it to be bad, but it is. Bad in just so many ways. And to make matters worse, this is not a film with not enough budget. It is not a film with too short a schedule. It is not a film that is been rushed out. It is not a film where too much influence has come from the outside. This is exactly the film the Wachowskis set out to make with Warners fortune fully behind them. And that is what makes this so awful. At least Rancid Aluminium can say that it did not haev enough time or money.Matrix Reloaded. The worst film ever made? Maybe not quite. The most disappointing and defalting film ever made.Undeniably.","label":0},{"index":6382,"txt":"Spoilers of both this and The Matrix follow.I liked the original Matrix a great deal. It was not a deep movie, despite Fishburnes attempts to philosophize, but it was fairly well paced, fun, and I have a soft spot for Hong Kong fights.In the original, Neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker Anderson. By day, corporate drone, and by night, brave hacker. Eventually, he eventually is forced to choose between these lives by his actions  does he become an outlaw fighting the machine, or does he go back to the safe, forgettable world he started in. Interestingly, he discovers that once one is shorn of illusions, life rather sucks. He has his girl by his side and his boon companions, but he eats processed swill, dresses in sweats, and lives in a truly skungy bit of machinery. Still, the truth makes him free.At least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the what if it were me questions raised in the viewers mind. What if _I_ were capable of the impossible? What if I were The One. It does not even matter that much what you are The One example of, with a cool title like that.Further, agent Smith made a wonderful bad guy, as he embodied all of the fear of authority that we carry with us. He was as unstoppable as a terminator, and as merciless.At the end of the Matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news of freedom.This movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the original movie, and it does so with such lack of gusto, such poor scriptwriting and such poor editing that I cannot believe they had planned these changes. When the dialog is at a fifth grade level, with various long words dropped in randomly, I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying.My short list of characterization failuresThe Oracle goes from mildly helpful, if deceitful to utterly obstructionist without any real reason.Major personalities of the matrix are introduced without need  the keymaster, for example, was a cute idea, but just not that interesting a character.Fishburne loses his advisor role, and gets nothing to replace it with.The people of Zion are not particularly likable, nor would you really _want_ them running the world.Special effects problemsThe fight scenes are pointless and intermitable. In The Matrix, you felt Neo could lose, and that he had to become something greater in order to survive. In The Matrix Reloaded, he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly plotted video game.The fight on the freeway looked quite fake, and not that interesting.Pacing problems.As I mentioned above, the fight scenes were interminable.The rave went on too long  everyone in my row at the theater was looking at their watch. Not because we mind good dancing and good orgies, but because we did not know about the people pictured, nor did we care.Whatever hack wrote the creators soliloquy should be blacklisted from the business. It meandered, used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand, and was a waste of time and a pacing killer. The creators speech could have been done in a tenth the time, and with more peril as Zion exists to give rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the Matrix. There are now too many people who do not believe; the matrix is in danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it. Further, the earth cannot support even the people in Zion, let alone these others. You may choose one person from Zion to form the new Zion, while I wipe the memories of the people currently in the Matrix.Instead, we got a long, drawn out bunch of twaddle. If someone argues that it is deep, ask for a transcript, and try breaking down the sentences. Each one is too long by several clauses, and uses words with clearer, shorter synonyms.So, in summary, not worth seeing.I have seen the third one, and despite what a number of reviewers have said, skip it. It does not save this turkey.The reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were deep should go see some truly deep movies. Perhaps read a book or two on rhetoric and debate, and perhaps a bit of philosophy.

But it is so much fun to watch. Everything about it is hilarious.The basic plot is a group of scientists from the future travel back in time to capture their evil coworker who is intent on destroying them all. They catch up with him in the year 1146. The futuristic lab of the scientists from the year 2033 is an eightiesstyle room with a bunch of futuristic flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn shed. The actors deliver their lines with unenthusiastic aplomb, which is not hard to understand considering that the lines are usually earthshakers like  I doublechecked everything twice! He double checked everything twice? He checked it four times? Not only that, but they feed you the entire premise of the movie in the first five minutes, and continue at a rapid fire pace until they hit the medieval part. When Roger Corman ran out of money. And had to stop travelling through time and consequently different sets. The medieval set is a comic mishmash of anything from the late 10th century to the 16th century. Any costume they could find, they used. I guess chain mail was not on the budget, ecause the guys all wear sequined shirts masquerading as armor. The fight scenes are laughable, with men casually throwing themselves onto cardboard swords with abandon and dying in death throws with nary a blow cast.It sounds truly awful, but I enjoy it every time I watch it. The lines alone are enough to have you in fits and everything else pulls together to create a fabulous Bmovie that, if you are a connoisseur of corny flicks, I would suggest you see.

About the only thing I remember was being incredibly bored by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart lookalike as the detective wore off real quick. It would be different if he could act, but he is a onenote entertainer. The kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them.

What amazes me is how slippery and morally highly questionable McNicol is. She plays an invalid a leg problem, yet she not only is not the ugly duckling whom men shun, but she is even a maneater  and we are supposed to feel for her! Oh, poor little McNicol, with her leg problem... Poor little McNicol??! She is constantly getting passes from men, and even dumps them without so much as blinking! At one occasion she even has a premeditated onenight affair with a blond stud, and then she tells her newlyfound French girlfriend quite nonchalantly that it took him time to get an erection! Makes us viewers wonder why she is so legconscious if every guy wants to hump her. Well, almost every guy; the only guy who really shunned her after seeing her leg wrapped up in metal is the guy working on the telephone. But otherwise she seems to be doing just fine with men! No shyness, no lack of success with men, and she throws them away like toys; the way she dumped Carradine was ridiculous. Poor little invalid girl?? I do not think so. And yet we are meant to believe that this woman has a major confidence problem; hence the scene in which she prepares to start playing the flute for a solo concert and somehow manages to throw the notes on the ground out of nervousness. Nervousness?? The rest of the movie shows little or nothing that would suggest that she has confidence problems, so this flute scene is absurd and does not fit into the bigger picture. I was also surprised how quickly and eagerly McNicol makes friends with a French woman who is screwing a married guy. On the surface the movie would appear to be a sentimental story of one crippled womans struggle for acceptance or something like that but it is nothing like that at all; the writer clearly shifts between this type of movie and a screw anything that moves  it is the 80s kind of movie  very confusing.As far as her leg it is not like she has a big, fat purple balloon growing on her calf muscle. She only has a normallooking metal prosthetic attached to the lower part of her leg, so I really do not understand why the makers of the film try to make it seem as if she is a female Quasimodo or something, at the beginning of the film. It is not like she has a twin head growing out of her neck! Though McNicol is hardly a major catch. Kind of cutish but nothing special, quite average.But what the hell is Carradine doing playing some kind of a relatively smooth guy flirting with McNicol and her pal?! This guy was in Revenge of the Nerds! But I guess it is the same thing with the Carradines in the movies as it is with the Kennedys in politics no matter how ugly, unable, or dumb, all the doors are open for a career in movies and politics, respectively.Down with nepotism.If you want to read bogus biographies about the Carradines, and other Hollywood nepotists and morons, contact me by email.","label":0},{"index":6386,"txt":"Any movie that has nude scenes of Karen Allen and I am still so bored I walk out, that is a stinker!

This is a memorable classic with a great cast in Robert Mitchum, Faith Domergue and Claude Rains. Crisply photographed in Black  White by Nicholas Musuraca it was tightly directed by John Farrow. Where Danger Lives is a prime example of the noir style of picture making and will always be remembered for its stylish craftsmanship that was Hollywoods past  See my full review.Unfortunately, none of the above praise can be applied to the second movie on the disc, the abysmal MGM 1949 stinker TENSION! Poorly written Allen Rivkin and directed by John Berry this movie is full of ludicrous characterisations and unlikely situations. The inconceivable relationship between a mild mannered and wimpish pharmacist  blandly played by Richard Baseheart  and his overtly floozy wife a risible Audrey Totter is totally implausible and unconvincing how on earth they ever got together in the first place is anybodys guess. Then when she unsurprisingly ditches him for one of her playmates Lloyd Gough our timid pharmacist, instead of being euphoric and over the moon with his new found good fortune, plots revenge and attempts to kill Gough but at the last minute chickens out. The guy gets murdered anyway and our pharmacist is immediately suspected by Homicide detective Barry Sullivan another bland performance. So who did kill him? Well, at this stage of the movie you really could not care less since it is all so badly executed and rendered ridiculous by director Berry. Mr. Berry has no idea of pacing and is unable to inject even a smidgen of style into the thing. There is nothing he can put in front of the camera that will prevent you from nodding off! The only TENSION contained in this movie is in the rubber band that is stretched to its limit and snaps in the fingers of Barry Sullivan as he gives the intro at the films opening. So much for that! A most unfortunate effort! Cest La Vie!Best things about this turkey is the smooth Monochrome Cinematography by the great Harry Stradling, an effective score by a young Andre Previn and an early dramatic appearance by the lovely Cyd Charisse before she found her dancing shoes. Hey!  maybe she could have saved the picture had she given us a few steps and a couple of pirouettes!

It is probably the cultural difference of perception here the ultimate beauty is not the showy type, as truly beautiful geisha would not be the over westernised pumpkin in the movie. Some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest flaws. As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt the actress are great. An actoractress can play any kind of role when heshe can look like it. Gong Li is great, but the power of emotions that she showed in this movie had not been translated into Japanese style. All I saw was a bittersweet and jealous Chinese WOMAN. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favourtie actress, did not even LOOK LIKE a Japanese. Some comment has mentioned the peculiar delicate, feminine characteristics of Japanese women, with which I cannot agree more. These are so delicate that I assume not even all modern Japanese actresses are eligible for the roles in Geisha, let alone the two Chinese and one Malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know Japanese culture that much.Geisha is a good shot for arousing the curiosity of American audiences.

A small detail that typifies the kind of lack of sensitivity of sorts is one scene no this does not spoil anything where Mameha rings a bell that hangs at the door of the house where Sayuri lives, on a snowy winter day. The bell she is ringing is a fuurin, or wind chime  that is only left hanging outside of houses in Japan in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes did not have doorbells  they just opened the door and announced themselves. You may think this is such a trivial detail, but I would equate this to a movie made about America where a Christmas wreath is hanging on the door in July and no one thinks anything of it. And do not even get me started on the totally wrong hairstyles given to the maiko and geisha, which is vaguely panAsianChinesekungfuish, and nothing like real thing. I think this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray really comes out in the attitudes and the portrayals of people and situations too. So, I suppose that the less you know about Japanese culture and the world of the geisha and maiko in Kyoto which is what Miyako is, then I suppose the more you will enjoy this.

Rob Marshall is using for his two main characters two well known Chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon.

In a later conversation she said, Imagine a Finnish director making a movie in Fnnish about the American Civil War using blond Swedish actors as union Army and Frenchmen as the Confederates.

Hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making. They frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong.

But other than one breathtaking dance, the rest of the movie degenerates into Pretty Baby in Storyville territory, or at least Vashti and Esther in the Purim story, as all the womens efforts at art and artifice are about entertaining much, much older, drunken boorish men. Maybe it is Japanese culture that is being prostituted, and not just to the American louts after World War II.Perhaps it is the strain of speaking in English, but Ziyi Zhang shows barely little of the great flare she demonstrated in House of Flying Daggers Shi mian mai fu and Hero Ying xiong. Michelle Yeoh occasionally gets to project a glimmer of her assured performance in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon Wo hu cang long. Only Li Gong shows any real life. Otherwise, I kept picturing Charles Ludlam in various roles, or even Cillian Murphy, as in kabuki theater, particularly as the plot dragged down in cat fight after cat fight.The supposed love story has zero chemistry, mostly due to the age differences, and I mostly felt sorry for Ken Watanabe and hoped his Hollywood pay check compensated for his loss of dignity as the mysterious Chairman. I remember more emotion in Portrait of Jennie as the young girl is anxious to grow up into Jennifer Jones to please Joseph Cotton.We see brief glimpses of reality when the geishas pose with regular women as photographic attractions, and as an ageless Ziyi Zhang lives out the war years in a very colorful kimono dying operation. The finale has little sense of normality.The score includes many chopped up traditional melodies, with cello by Yo Yo Ma and violin by Yitzhack Pearlman instead of traditional instrumentation, that are beautiful to listen to in accompaniment to the lovely cinematography, as long as one completely ignores the plot and stiff acting.As my mind wandered, I wondered how the great Japanese directors of samurai movies would have dealt with this story, which probably would have been more formal, but a lot more emotional.","label":0},{"index":6399,"txt":"This show is painful to watch ...It is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show, from the ever changing jobs, boyfriends, and cast.

It is a story about a few American mens mistaken ideas about Japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions. So what is this movie if it is not about Japan or geisha? Is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? Yes, but then why make it into an American fantasy?There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hangups, no connotations of sin about sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex handled in this movie? Right. Like it was dirty. The closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has Sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. Does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? Nope. One character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she does not want to get caught doing something dirty. Such typical American puritanism has no place in a movie about Japanese geisha.Did Sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off? Nope. She lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block. Of course she is not supposed to enjoy it. And that is what I mean about this movie. Why could not they have given her something to enjoy? Why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong?Behind Mameha the Chairman was Sayuris secret patron, and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity. He could have rigged the auction and won her himself. Nobu did not even bid. So why did the Chairman let that old codger win her and, reeking of oldman stink, get his fingers all over her naked body? Would any woman ever really forgive a man for that?Let us try to make sense of this. By being behind Mameha the Chairman incurred debts for Sayuris geisha training. In order to recoup his debts the Chairman had Sayuri sold to Dr. Crab. Through Mameha the Chairman sold Sayuris sexual favors to that old geezer so that the Chairman could make some money out of her. The Chairman was not her patron. He was her pimp! Some romantic love story.Yes, the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive, alluring transvestite whose voice, appearance and every touch are thrilling.

The casting is silly, starting at the top Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians? Not enough makeup in Cairo for that, at least not while this film was being made. But it is rather amusing to see them try. The performances run the gamut from mummylike sorry, the obvious observation to overthetop, with very few stops in between. The LesleyAnne Down character seems as though she could not find Egypt on a map, much less expound upon its archaeological treasures. That is due at least in part to some really bad writing, one of the curses that will be visited upon every viewer of this movie. It is my opinion that movies involving a curse or that draw their basis from a subject that is somewhat esoteric, such as Egyptology, are ripe for silly, overwritten dialogue. It does not disappoint, and the convergence proves a doublewhammy. The plot has one driving source of dramatic tension Can this get dumber and less believable? The answer is, usually, YES. The location shots are beautiful, and the set design is generally very good, the only consistent reminders that this was not some lowbudget production. That and the fact that there are so many wellknown faces doing service in such an unintentional laugher.

A couple of years later it was the turn of another Robin Cook bestseller to get the big screen treatment , but in the case of Sphinx virtually everything that could go wrong does go wrong. This is a dreadful adventure flick consisting of wooden performances, stupid dialogue, unconvincing characters and leaden pacing. The only reason it escapes a 1outof10 rating is that the Egyptian backdrop provides infinitely more fascination than the story itself. Hard to believe Franklin J. Schaffner of Patton and Planet Of The Apes is the director behind this debacle.Pretty Egyptologist Erica Baron Lesley AnneDown is on a working vacation in Cairo when she stumbles across the shop of antiques dealer AbduHamdi John Gielgud. Hamdi befriends Erica and is impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge. Consequently, he shows her a beautiful and incredibly rare statue of Pharoah Seti I that he is keeping secretly in his shop. The very existence of the statue arouses intense excitement in Erica, for it could provide vital clues in locating Seti Is longlost tomb, a prize as great as the discovery of Tutankhamuns tomb in 1922. Before Hamdi can tell Erica any more he is brutally murdered in his shop, with Erica watching in silent terror as he meets his grisly end. Afraid yet tantalised by what she has seen, Erica attempts to track down the treasure. She finds herself helped and hindered in her quest by various other parties, none of whom are truly trustworthy. For one there is Yvon Maurice Ronet, seemingly a friend but perhaps a man with sinister ulterior motives? Then there is Akmed Khazzan Frank Langella, an Egyptian for whom Erica feels a certain attraction but who may also be hiding dangerous secrets from her.The biggest problems with Sphinx generally result from its total disregard for plausibility. Down could not be less convincing as a female Egyptologist \u0096 one assumes she would be quite welleducated and resourceful, yet she spends the entire film screaming helplessly like some busty bimbo from a teen slasher flick. On those rare occasions that she actually is not running from a potential villain, she does other brainless things such as taking Polaroid flash photos in a 4,000 year old tomb! The plot twists are heavyhanded to say the least, mainly comprising of revelations and doublecrosses that can be predicted well in advance. One cannot even try to enjoy the film on the level of dumb but entertaining action fare, because the pacing is awfully sluggish. What little action can be found is separated by long stretches of tedium. A famous review of the movie declared Sphinx stinks! Never before has a 2hour film been so aptly summed up in 2 words.","label":0},{"index":6416,"txt":"Some nice scenery, but the story itselfin which a selfproclaimed Egyptologist LesleyAnne Down visits Egypt and, in the course of doing Egyptologist things in the most unEgyptologistic of ways e.g., flash photography in the tombs, the handling of old parchment, etc., uncovers a black market turf war and somehow in the span of two days, no less! becomes that wars jumpsuitwearing epicenteris more puzzling than any riddle the Sphinx ever posed. Down is simply awful as the visiting British scholar that she seems to know absolutely nothing about the culture of Egypt and even less about antiquities is the fault of the writers, certainly; but that she is annoying as all get out is her own fault entirely, and the rest of the cast, including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, seem as downright confused by the proceedings as I was. In short, not what you would expect from Schaffner Planet of the Apes, Patton and co.Worth watching for a laughably dated scene in which Down rails against all male scholars, blaming them for her failure as an academic, while bathed under the softest light Hollywood could muster. To top it off, she spends the next hour of the film shrieking and harried and running into the arms of any dude she can find.

For the record, director Schaffner had just made THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL 1978 \u2013 a similarly fanciful but much more engrossing suspenser and, unfortunately, SPHINX was a false step from which his sofar impressive career would not recover.Despite its scope and reasonably decent cast, however, this one proved a critical and commercial flop \u2013 mainly because the narrative just isn\u2019t very thrilling in fact, it\u2019s quite dreary feeble attempts at horror \u2013 the archaeologist heroine having to put up with entombment, rotting corpses galore, and even an attack by a flurry of bats \u2013 notwithstanding. Lesley AnneDown is the lovely leading lady, stumbling upon a lost treasure \u2013 it\u2019s actually been hidden away by a local sect to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners, who have appropriated much of the country\u2019s heritage under the pretext of culture for far too long. Sir John Gielgud turns up in a thankless bit early on as the antique dealer who puts Down on the way of the loot, and pays for this act of treason\u2019 with his life.Typically, it transpires that some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be \u2013 so that apparent allies such as Maurice Ronet are eventually exposed as villains, while an ambiguous figure Frank Langella, whom I saw at London in early 2007 in a West End performance of \u201cFrostNixon\u201d, which has now been turned into a film goes from Down\u2019s antagonist to her lover and back again, as he determines to keep the wealth belonging to Egyptian high priest Menephta a national treasure.","label":0},{"index":6418,"txt":"This film has nothing whatever to do with the Sphinx, and the title is just a comeon. The story concerns an imagined true and concealed tomb in the Valley of the Kings, of King Seti I, second pharaoh of the 19th Dynasty, New Kingdom period. It is not a bad yarn, and a great deal of the film is shot on location. Even the scenes in the Winter Palace Hotel lobby in Luxor were really shot there, and not in a studio. The second unit stuff is endless, and they must have been let loose on Egypt for weeks. Frank Langella is very good indeed as a sophisticated Egyptian. He should take it up as a sideline. The film is essentially ruined by one of the worlds most irritating actresses, Lesley Anne Down, who plays the lead. She spends the whole film wondering how she looks, are her blue eyes refracting light at the correct angle, do all the fellas lust after her, etc. Having started life as a model at the age of ten, what hope could there be for her? She epitomises everything that is most revolting about female vanity and dimwitted inanity. And to think that this film was directed by Franklin Shaffner, who won an Oscar for Patton! He allows this terrible actress to whimper and simper through the film, hysterical one moment, flirting the next, in a kind of hurricane of idiocy as she reels from one man to another, either screaming or making bedroom eyes, it matters not. She is supposed to be a young Egyptologist. But she has never been to Egypt before! She takes a taxi to Giza and catching her first glimpse of the pyramids, gushes in ecstasy But they are so BIG!!!! Barf! OK, so that was the script, but she takes to the banality too readily, giving the impression that it is her natural element, which I do not doubt for a minute. Elements of the story are sound. There is, indeed, a serious problem about a black market in antiquities there. True! Well done! The novel by Robin Cook, which I have not seen, may be OK for all I know. It was fun to see the name of Cyril Swern as sound recordist on the film, as I knew him pretty well long ago. Stanley Kubricks stepdaughter Katharina is described as draughtswoman. I wonder what that means? Maybe she did some set work. Anyway, the antiquities in the film are pretty good, actually. And we get to see lots of the Cairo Museum and numerous scenic locations. They actually go inside King Tutankhamuns Tomb! I do not imagine that would be allowed today for a movie. A lot of inappropriate scenes take place in mosques. That would not go down well today, but in 1981 such things were not on the agenda. The music for the film is absolutely appalling, worse than Lesley Anne Down in fact! But there were sound track elements which were surprisingly authentic, one being the cacophony of traffic noise of Cairo, which is accurately rendered in the background, and would make anyone who knows Cairo chuckle nervously. Also, the loudspeaker calls to prayer are there the whole time, another touch of authenticity. Why did not they get this right?

I grew up watching Seseme Street before a lot of the people who have written comments were even born. I was born in 1964, so I was 5yrsold when Seseme Street was introduced to television. The show taught me my numbers The Count, spelling the Muppet, and about life. I liked all the old characters Big Bird, Oscar, Grover, and Cookie Monster and do not quite understand why they had to change. I understand that everything has to change in some way, but to make Cookie Monster into a veggie monster to promote healthy eating. The show has introduced new characters and monsters since it is inception, why not make a separate veggie monster that talksdiscusses the benefits of eating a varied diet with Cookie Monster. But, back to my point. I grew up watching the very beginning of Seseme Street, my now 20 yrold daughter grew up watching SS with me along side her, and we discussed Mr. Hooper dying, although he had died prior to her being born, as well as other topics on the show. I saw the episode as a older child, and still remember how well they portrayed the event, much like real life. And I am sure it hit the cast extremely hard as all deaths and losses effect families. You saw this on the show and it allowed parents and children to discuss very difficult events. The show has talked about traditional families, adoptive families and combined families. It is one of the few shows that actually discusses these scenarios. I now have a 5 yrold daughter who really does not watch SS. I have tried to watch the show a couple of times, but, it really is not what it used to be. The Elmo 12 hr with Mr. Noodle is absolutely ridiculous. Like many people have said, it does not teach anything. It is geared for the less than 18 month old maybe, and is not even funny. I always prided myself on watching SS as a child, teen, and adult with my own child. Now on my second goround, I really have a hard time watching SS. The topics that were discussed death, marriage, nontraditional families, new to neighborhoods, moving away were related to children and adults in a manner easy for 299 year old to understand and relate to. Now, there are NO concepts taught, minimal counting, only the occasional mention of the alphabet. It is NOT the same SS, from an original watcher of the show.

Per\u00fa, not even in its most violent times, has not shown polices or soldiers as much as in this film. This showed a country like El Salvador when Civil War. Since I am a Peruvian who lives in Lima the capital of Per\u00fa, it was too funny to me seeing the police guards here, there and everywhere. 2. If you have a car in Per\u00fa, and you want or need to be a taxi driver, just post a sticker with the word Taxi on the front glass of your car and you can drive freely in Peruvian streets there are taxi companies, but their rates are quite expensive. No need of yellow or a blackwhite squared band on the doors of your car. Well, taxis in this film have that band, somethin that you will never see in Per\u00fa. 3. Peruvian people are not Caribbean styled clothing. For example, when a taxi driver comes out, he was wearing a Guayabera Cuban shirt, a white hat, and 40s mustaches, like Clark Gable. Not one Peruvian man looks like that, please! Per\u00fa is not the Caribbeans! 4. A scene shows a woman on a street with a quite long skirt, like the typical folklore dresses in Latin America. Take a walk anywhere in Per\u00fa, and you will never find a woman wearing like that, unless you are watching a typical dance. 5. Cast could have been better I can not deny H\u00e9ctor Elizondo is a great actor, but he is not a Latin actor his father was Basque and his mother from Puerto Rico, but he was born in New York and his Spanish is not fluent. It is notorious Spanish is not his first language. There are dozens of very good Latin actors who could have performed as Cardinal Sebasti\u00e1n. Petrus Antonius General Rodr\u00edguez was also a bad choice for a Latin Police officer. It was so funny seeing Elizondo and Petronius in General Rodr\u00edguezs office. They looked like two English or American students in a Spanish class, making their best effort in order to pronounce Spanish. Unsuccessfully, of course. Castulo Guerra was better in his Spanish. A Peruvian officer, who announced Cardinal Sebasti\u00e1n, spoke a quite funny Spanish too. There are very good Peruvian actors, like Augusto AlvarezCalder\u00f3n and Christian Meier just to mention two out of many Peruvian actors, who could have performed with excellence. 6. I admit that a fictional movie can let itself a license inventing cities or, even, countries. But, please, when creating a name, be careful when using a foreign language The town portrayed in this movie should have been called Vicente and not Viciente. Vicente is a male name, and Viciente has never been used. 7. I disagree one user, who says that this movie was filmed on locations in Per\u00fa. Not one location is Peruvian, although the production has used in excess posters showing Inca Kola, the Peruvian soda. As not few American films, this one must have used any Latin country. After all, for American producers or directors, a Latin place is identical to any other Latin place. 8. In the first scenes, when John Matthew Settle flies to Per\u00fa, he is supposed to arrive to the only one international airport in Per\u00fa Jorge Ch\u00e1vez Airport in Lima, the capital. Actually, believe me, it must be any airport in the world, but Peruvian airport. And, of course, in Peruvian airports there are no military or police guards. 9. When this John takes a room in a Peruvian hotel, this one has a fan and, obviously has no air conditioner. Please, this does not happen in no hotel in Per\u00faand other Latin countries, unless you get a 1 star hotel! 10. The rebels who fight against the government are... \u00a1Colombians! Their accent was, with no doubt, from Colombia. For casting them, the producers should have hired Peruvian actors. In few words, it would have been cheaper filming in Per\u00fa.I could go on with more examples out of this film, that led me to give it a 1 awful vote, but I fell asleep after about 20 minutes from its beginning.

Or something like that. They actually talk about this spiritual stuff being the next step in human evolution, which should make anybody who has even the faintest idea of what human evolution is cringe.

Their motivation  objectivity is dubious, since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults, but at its well intentioned message of New Age consciousness.So would it be alright for some twenty to thirty Evangelical Christians, or Islamic Fundamentalists to pour in positive ratings about moviestelevision that support their views? In spite of the poor qualities of production, or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis? I hope not.I am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie, in spite of the truth.","label":0},{"index":6438,"txt":"This delectable fusion of New Age babble and luridly bad filmmaking may not open you up, to borrow one of the films favorite verbs, but it might leave your jaw slack and your belly sore from laughter or retching. Based on the bestselling book by James Redfield, first self published in 1993, this cornucopia of kitsch tracks the spiritual awakening of an American history teacher Matthew Settle who, on traveling to deepest, darkest, phoniest Peru and sniffing either the air or something else more illegal. Namely what he discovers is a schlock Shangri La populated by smiling zombies who may be nuts or just heavily medicated, perhaps because they are often accompanied by a panpipe flourish and an occasional shout out from a celestial choir. Although there is a lot of talk about energy, that quality is decidedly missing from the motley cast whose numbers include Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, all of whom are now firmly ensconced in the camp pantheon. For those who care, the plot involves the military, terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni provided the inept direction while Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the hoot of a script. In short, easily the worst film seen in 40 years of viewing movies.","label":0},{"index":6439,"txt":"I have just seen this movie and have not read the book. The good thing of the movie is that at some parts it gets you thinking for a little while on the spiritual subject, evolution, sincronicity and your part in the world.However, the movies immersion is easily broken and there is very little rapport between the viewer and the characters. It is very clear that the book looses a lot in this movie version. The events that were suppose to show sincronicity taking place are almost unrecognizable. A lot of reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence, and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose. Enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create the better feeling that it was supposed to. Do you recall the enlightenment with Keanu Reeves in Little Buddha ? Well, this is nothing like that.Most scenes are poorly executed. There are a lot of scenes that really do not develop the story and also do not help in creating an atmosphere.The better actors in this movie, namely Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and J\u00fcrgen Prochnow cannot save it. The first 2 seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters should in an attempt to save the movie, and because they were paid more, but this does not work. Most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all.J\u00fcrgen does good in his scenes and sells as an evil guy as always, but the script does not help him at all. The scene where he first tries to convince John Matthew Settle to join him is just bad script. The execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly bad executed. The flashbacks throughout the movie cannot even be commented.Overall this movie is a big waist of time, read the book! I have not read it, but it is probably a billion times better than this, it has to be.It is so bad that I had to write my first comment in IMDb.","label":0},{"index":6440,"txt":"The movie was TERRIBLE!!!

Thank you for giving me an answer to that burning question What is the worst movie you have seen? Answer Celestine Prophecy. Trust me...I read the book, enjoyed the message and was excited to see the movie, but then, they treated the audience like we are rtarded. There is no story and the story that is there is crippled by too much magic and coincidence. It is too bad they have to spell out the nine prophecies and cannot simply weave them into a story that is entertaining to follow. They did not spend any time on character development and it was easy to not care if any character died. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stuck around until the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is pretty boring too but I enjoyed the parallels that could be seen in everyday life while you read the book. The film does not offer the same opportunity and I would suggest not seeing it if you want to continue to hold the words of the book close to your heart. Do not SEE THIS MOVIE.

It was difficult to determine who were the bad guys the rebels or the military or the church or all of them? I am still left puzzled by certain miniplots from the movie. I am left dumbfounded as to certain aspects of this socalled prophecy, which is never really FULLY explained. I felt like I was watching a corny episode of a miniseries on the scifi channel.

Even though there are visible attempts at measuring up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain of ABCs Lost or Dan Browns The Da Vinci Code, the filmmakers are hardly up to the task.

Cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to Cages shifting accent and out of control body language. Cage simply never settles into his role. He tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that is what is needed in a love story. Cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a Jimmy Stewart type character. Cage keeps taking these roles, perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor does not lend itself to them, though he is gotten better at it with repeated attempts. He should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self.","label":0},{"index":6444,"txt":"My dear Lord,what a movie!

But as far as I know they did not have cell phones in the 60s...What I am looking for in movies is mainly a good story with a really good message. Acting is secondary, effects are secondary, I do not even mind a few little inconsistencies. However, in a movies like this bad acting, incredibility, etc. add up to make a bad movie even worse  that is what happened for me with the Celestine Prophecy.My wife said the book was actually really good and even though I am not into all that spiritual stuff I can somehow see that it can be brought across in a believable way  the movie failed to do so.There could be one single reason to watch this one though. If you really love cheesy movies it will be the right one for you. If the IMDb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality I MUST have rated this movie ten stars.By the way, three stars are for the fact that there are worse movies out there, like Critical Mass look up the comments on that one  hilarious.

When people feel how well instinct enables them to flawlessly navigate through the complexities of life I wonder how they fail to do a simple thing like finding the train station.But then again, this is not the first movie with plot holes and most of them I find perfectly acceptable and entertaining. If this were the case with The Celestine Prophecy I would not burn this movie down, but unfortunately it is not. Every actor seems to be bored out of his head and unable to grasp what he are actually supposed to be doing on location. This results in many Ahs and Ohs, like I tend to do when talking about quantum physics with somebody who actually knows what he is talking about and pretend to understand.The direction is uninspired as well.

In reality, there are no ancient scrolls and if the author was hard pressed I am sure he would have to admit he is never laid eyes on any scrolls in ancient Aramaic found in Peru. These valuable texts written as usual by anonymous, were destroyed by the evil truth haters in the church and in the local government. That is rather strange, as all kinds of New Age crap comes out each yearhundreds of books, dozens of moviesand the Roman Catholic church does not seem to me to be hell bent on destroying the movement which it probably views as I do, a total crock of doody. I am no fan of the church, mind you, but at least the ancient texts which they base their faith on are real.It is a typical pattern of scam artists and religious hucksters to claim to have seen or translated ancient documents which unfortunately got destroyed by evil men or in Joseph Smiths case, got taken back to Heaven once translated. Therefore, the actual texts cannot be found in any museums like the Smithsonian, nor the translations checked by specialists in ancient languages like Coptic or Aramaic. It is a scam. In one sense, I admire anybody smart enough to come up with a great idea and make millions off it, but I could not do it myself, as I have no desire to mislead the public with more New Agey hokum.Occasionally, a genuine ancient text does get found hidden away and lost for years. The Gospel of Judas, a Gnostic text, was discovered and after carbon dating and diligent study of the text, deemed authentic by experts. The Gospel of Judas was referenced as heretical around 300 C.E.. No church documents from that time mention any Celestine Prophecies as authentic, heretical or anything else.We are evolving towards somethingthat much is truebut the optimism in the Celestine Prophecy is based on nothing but fiction and lies, and a philosophy built on a foundation of lies, like a castle built on sand will collapse. The harsh, ugly, overpopulated, cruel world of Blade Runner is more likely what it will be like over the Horizon, than some Utopian Hippie Commune where all is love and peace! I tell people the truth and they hate me, but tell them what they want to hear, even if pure piffle, and one can make millions. The Celestine Prophecy is what the world wants to hear. Too bad it is a castle built on sand. Do not get me wrong. I wish to God, the Celestine Vision was reality, only it is not. No ancient philosophy at any time expressed ideas given in the Insights with the modern concept of spiritual evolution going hand in hand with biological evolution. These New Agey ideas did not exist in the ancient world and did not exist until Darwininan Evolution became wellknown. That means the ideas in the Celestine Prophecies cannot be older than the 1800s C.E, and do not go back to the early B.C.E period or near the time of Jesus of Nazareth. This type of claim by New Agers is not at all unusual. Wiccans claim their brand of magic and witchcraft  the old religion goes back to the stone age, when in reality no Book of Shadows has ever been known to exist prior to Gerald Gardner who lived in the 1900s and was the buddy of Aleister Crowley.New Age gurus tell lies and claim their ideas are based on ancient teachings, when the ancients would thumb their noses at such absurdities that are preached by Gurus today. Why do they do what they do, perpetrate such fraud? Simple there are millions of dollars to be made, and the modern Guru acquires power over his or her followers. They compete fiercely and have a strong hatred for their competition despite their claims of love for all things. Each New Age group bitter opposes the others.

The flow of events that in the book are very smooth, are choppy and fed to the view as though you a child. The character development is very poor.

No background or personal development leaves the audience not really caring at all about what happens to them, and so the action sequences fall flat.The search for the manuscripts ends abruptly, and with no real explanation, not leaving any sense of satisfaction as to what the whole search was for.This is one of the worst adaptations of a book I have ever seen.

NATIVE American REFERENCES The Native American references felt really out of place and contrived. It is obvious that this director and writer tried tackling an arena they never played in before. They should have stuck to the old adage of write about something you know.

UNFORTUNATELY I could not say the same about Expiration Date. Sunshine took us to clich\u00e9 incidents but the filmmakers were so clever at their approach that the outcome would take us to a different direction avoiding the trap of being a cliche. This movie on the other hand had no way of not falling in the trap because it was already TRAPPED from the start.

They are antiAmerican, proItalian and always at each other in someway. She has been going out with Johnny Camarary for a while, a nice mammas boy man, and he asks her to marry him. She says yes.

When Johnny goes off to Sicily to care for his dying mother, he asks that Loretta make contact with his brother who he is been estranged from for years.This victory for human rights carries even greater significance, as Sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment. In 1938, Italian psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti, saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs, easing the job of slitting their throats. Cerletti was inspired, and began experimenting with electroshock on humans, developing the first Electroshock machine. Broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern.This was,in so many ways, an antiAmerican movie. It is about love, to be sure, but it is also about infidelity, secrets, lonely people, and strange behavior brought on by American policies. The characters, from the frumpy BoBo at the favorite restaurant, the aunt and uncle, her parents and their problems, the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters. It is somewhat of a chick flick, as it is how Loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp.

Two of these were made for their 1991 classic, Beauty and the Beast. Well, these ones are not really sequels, as they are both set in between the events of the first film. The first of these two straighttovideo films was Beauty and the Beast The Enchanted Christmas, which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor, but I think that can usually be expected with sequels. However, this second one, Belles Magical World, is definitely inferior.The film features three short stories, all of which take place while Belle is in the castle, and the place is under the spell of the enchantress. The first is The Perfect Word, where a misunderstanding at the table between Belle and the Beast leads to trouble, and neither wants to be the first to apologize. The next story is Fifis Folly, where Fifi and Lumieres fifth anniversary is coming up, and Lumiere is unprepared, so Belle helps him. However, Fifi sees Lumiere practicing romance with Belle, and thinks they are actually in love. The film ends with The Broken Wing. In this story, Belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing, but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the Beast finds out, as he hates birds! The plot description I gave is for the original VHS version of Disneys third Beauty and the Beast movie. Apparently, in the DVD version, there is another story added called Mrs. Pottss Party, but I have only seen the original version. However, since I highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest, I see no point in watching the special edition. Anyway, the first thing I will say about Belles Magical World is that the animation is very 2dimensional compared to what we are used to from Disney, which would obviously disappoint many people. I did not like Beauty and the Beast The Enchanted Christmas that much, but you certainly cannot say the same about its animation. I am sure the stories in Belles Magical World could entertain many kids mostly younger ones, I think, and each story has a moral, so they could also teach them some valuable lessons. However, for adults, the film really does not have a lot. I personally did not find any good humour in it, found that the constant conflict between Belle and the Beast got tiring, and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way they are not very well written. In The Perfect Word, the way Belle says to the Beast, You are acting rude... and foolish! is a bit cheesy, and I think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these stories.By the time this straighttovideo movie first came out, I was around eleven or twelve years old. I do not know what I would have thought of it at the time, as I had lost interest in Disney by then, and it would be years before I would gain any of that interest back. Even when this movie was first released, I think I was a bit past the age group it was aimed at. I never saw Beauty and the Beast The Enchanted Christmas until a couple months ago, but unlike that film, I never even heard of this one until recently, I think just after seeing the first sequel to Disneys 1991 hit. Well, as much as I like the theatrical original, I would not have been missing much if I never became aware of this films existence. For little kids, I am sure Belles Magical World can be highly entertaining, and probably somewhat educational with its morals, but I do not recommend it for adult Disney fans.","label":0},{"index":6460,"txt":"That is right!

Poor, poor Mrs Potts was not brought to life by Angela Lansbury one of my favourite classic actresses but by Anne Rogers who captured none of Mrs Potts character, no offence to her! Not if she did her best! When the beast roars it sounds so horrifically fake with clearly no additional roars, snarls or growls by a microphone. I am aware that this is only a third feature following two other films so of course it would not be as good but I am sure that more of a contribution would not have hurt the Disney artists who, indeed, have achieved such remarkable styles of animation over the years. It is alright, I guess, and I do watch it sometimes though only when it suits me. It is quite difficult to make a recommendation for you reading this because it depends on how old you are but remember this will not at all be what you may expect following the earlier spectacular movies! And to think that on my video of it the text on the back cover said boasting brilliant animation! It is a nice little flick but for one thing it is also highly poor and, for another, those 3 words ought to have been saved for the next rerelease of the original!","label":0},{"index":6461,"txt":"SPOILER WARNING There are some minor spoilers in this review. Do not read it beyond the first paragraph if you plan on seeing the film.The Disney Channel currently has a policy to make loads of movies and show one a month on the cable channel. Most of these are mediocre and drab, having a few good elements but still being a disappointment Phantom of the Megaplex, Stepsister From Planet Weird, Zenon Girl of the 21st Century. Every once in a great while, they make something really, really great Genius, The Other Me. But once in a while The Disney Channel makes a huge mistake, and gives us a real stinker. This month December 2000 The Disney Channel featured The Ultimate Christmas Present, which I thought was terrible due to poor writing and worse acting. Apparently, The Brainiacs.com was rushed out a few days before Christmas to get a jump on the holiday, because the plot has to do with toys. They even paid for a feature in the TV Guide, so I thought it must be better than the norm. I was in for a complete shock. Only Disneys Model Behaviour has been worse than this.The plot was more farfetched than normal. I usually let that slide, but here it just goes too far. Matthew Tyler gets very sick of his widowed father spending most of his time at work. His father owns a small toy factory that has taken out large loans at a scrupulous bank to stay afloat. Time and time again, his father has to skip out on the plans he makes with his son and daughter. Matthew decides that the only way he can spend time with his dad is if he becomes the boss and orders him to stay home. He gets a hairbrained idea to create a website where kids all around the world can find and send him a dollar to invest in a computer chip that his sister is inventing. That whole concept is full of fallacies. When kids send in millions of dollars, Matthew opens his own companys bank account and buys up most of his dads businesss stock. He is the secret boss, but he does not reveal this to his dad, but instead presents himself at board meetings as a cartoon image through a computer. That image itself is so complex and ridiculous that it is not possible for someone to create it at home, much less someone who comes across as stupid as Matthew. To make a long plot short, Matthew orders his dad to spend more time having fun and doing stuff with his kids, but a federal agent shows up inquiring about Matthews company, as it is fraudulent.There is so much wrong here. As mentioned, the stuff they do here is impossible even for true geniuses, which these kids are not. The website, the cartoon image, the computer chip, even the stuff they are being taught in school, are far too advanced for these kids. The acting by most of the cast, especially Kevin Kilner, is terrible. Some familiar faces are wasted. Dom DeLuise plays the evil bank owner, but his part is a throwaway. He has one good scene with Alexandra Paul who shows she has the ability to act in which he explains his motives, but nothing more. And Rich Little is wasted in a small role as a judge. There is even some offensive and uncalled for antiRussian jokes. But the greatest atrocities are the hardhammered themes. These themes show up in many of The Disney Channels films, but never before have these ultraconservative messages been pounded so strongly. The typical overworking parent idea is really pushed hard, and after delivering it inappropriately in The Ultimate Christmas Present, seeing it again sours my mood. Family relations are important, but Disney must stop this endless preaching, because working is important to maintaining a workable family, too. Except for cancelling activities thanks to work, the father did not come across as that bad, but I found it offensive when the grandmother told him I do not like what I see. Just as bad is the preaching of the idea that all single parents MUST marry if they want to raise their kids right. Enter Alexandra Paul, whose character, while important to the plot, is there solely to be the love interest for the father. This offensiveness only proves that the Disney brain trust lacks the brains to avoid scraping from the bottom of the Disney script barrel. Instead of letting this movie teach your kids how to commit serious fraud, wait for the next Disney Channel movie. It has to be better than this.

John Wheeler, one of Americas finest theoretical physicists, would roll his eyes about this movie.

I recommend anyone considering watching this movie read it first before contributing to a cults coffers.httpskeptico.blogs.comskeptico200504what_the_bleep_.html I noticed one reviewer here at IMDb say to take this movie with a grain of salt. It will take enough salt to kill a horse to wade through the garbagethinking of this movie.","label":0},{"index":6467,"txt":"What The Bleep Do We Know is a deluded and haphazard look at the mysteries of the universe. We are presented with a parade of apparent experts none of whom are named who ramble and pontificate in a thoroughly unscientific manner. Their interviews are chopped up into aggravatingly small segments and dispersed throughout some flashy cgi and banal miniplots.The film pilfers themes from science, philosophy, theology and politics, minces them together without any regard for accuracy, and then somehow extracts a few prosaic and absurd conclusions. We are led to believe that quantum physics is telling us the purpose of our existence, and any other difficult to answer question the filmmakers would like to point their finger at.It is riddled errors and logical nonsequiturs. How did we start at quantum mechanics and end up with this pseudoscientific spirituality and mysticism? It is like saying two plus two equals four, therefore I can move objects with my mind.There is nothing original in this film, and almost nothing that is accurate. Any discriminating viewer will be annoyed by heavyhanded editing, intrusive and pointless special effects and general lack of substance. Educated viewers will be frustrated to tears by the violence done to science and every other subject this film touches on.","label":0},{"index":6468,"txt":"This movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify nonsensical ideas, capped by such statements like we all create our own reality.Sorry, folks, reality is what true for all of us, not just the credulous.The idea that anythings possible does not hold water on closer examination if anythings possible, contrary things are thus possible and so nothings possible. This leads to postmodernistic nonsense, which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate established truths so that all ideas, wellfounded and stupid, are equal.To quote scifi writer Philip K. Dick, who put it so well, Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, does not go away.","label":0},{"index":6469,"txt":"I did not know much about this movie before I watched it, but I heard it had something to do with quantum physics so I was interested. What I did not know is that this is NOT ACTUALLY A STORY but a bunch of NewAge blowhards who love the sound of their own voice talking about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics. I say it belongs more in the Documentary category than Comedy or Drama.Marlee Matlin is in the movie, in order to give this New Age symposium some sort of a storyline. Her portions of the film feel horribly tacked on and are meant to display the speakers thoughts so we will not die of boredom. Matlin has a real job as a photographer, unlike the New Age hippie that crashes on her couch. We get to listen to nameless people ramble on about what quantum physics all means to them. The one bright spot in this movie was the speaker from India I assume, but I think he showed up for the wrong film.It looks like Barbara Eden really let herself go and she goes on and on about how quantum science has something to do with her crazy New Age beliefs. It looks like Quark from DS9 was running low on cash and he also makes a brief appearance in the film. There is a lot of whizbang CGI we are supposed to be impressed with; cells in the body are shown as dancing jello molds, because the filmmakers have apparently seen Flubber one too many times.People in the movie say that the Arawak people on San Salvador thought Columbuss ship the Pinta was invisible because natives had never seen clipper ships before, as if people today had any way possible way of knowing. Of course they leave out all of that information and just say Columbuss ships were invisible to the Indians in America. The film takes many such arrogant leaps. Thomas Young did a doubleslit experiment around 1805 and found that light can look like a particle some of the time, and a wave some of the time. Of course you would never know this from watching this stupid film because the only reference to it is that atoms can be particles and waves. And that must mean that people can pass through walls, walk on water, and never grow old if they just wish upon a star!! Then I am sure Marlee Matlin could stop being deaf if she just believed hard enough. I am being sarcastic, but this film is chockfull of false hope and beliefs that the people espousing them do not really hold.These are New Age kooks who have grabbed onto Quantum Theory as if it reaffirms everything they believe about meditation, zero point energy, crystal healing, etc. If these snakeoil salesmen truly believed the crap they were selling, could not they just wish their paychecks into existence instead of appearing in this joke of a film? We get to listen to another nameless man, with no credentials that we know of, talk on his couch in front of a fireplace or TV screen about how he creates his own life. Every time he was on the screen I wanted someone to rush in and throw a pie in his face. These people take themselves WAY too seriously. Some other balding guy in a suit says that nobody ever really touches anything because there is a magnetic force preventing it at the quantum level. If only someone had walked onto the screen and kept punching him in the stomach, screaming I am not touching you! I am not touching you! A moral relativist in the movie claims that there is really no such thing as good or bad. So apparently it is OK that Hitler gassed millions of Jews to death? Another person says that there is no such thing as love. It is just a chemical and that we really do not love people, we are just addicted to the chemical rush we have when we are around them. I suspect this guy is doing this film as community service for being addicted to heroin for so many years.We are witness to a truly pathetic sequence where two young adults walk around a wedding reception, seeing everything like RoboCop. They evaluate if women are cows, dogs, or foxes, and a sexual position pops onto the scree. Marlee Matlin gets drunk at the wedding she is supposed to photograph and the next day decides to love herself and take a bath because she is a beautiful and unique snowflake.I liked when the film said people often find evidence for their preconceived notions. Perhaps in this review I am only seeing what I want to see, but I TRULY wanted to see these people get pies to the face, and it never happened.If you have never heard of any of the ideas presented in the film before, you may find them interesting, but there are better sources for all of the ideas here. If you want to watch a good movie that talks about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, go see The Man Who Was not There. If you want to read a good book about Quantum Field Theory, read Hyperspace by Michio Kaku. If you want to see a film that talks about different philosophies with imaginative visuals, see Waking Life although it can feel boring, selfimportant, and pretentious at times. All in all, you should go and read Quantum Psychology or Prometheus Rising by Robert Anton Wilson instead of wasting your time on this movie.I normally have a very hard time giving movies a score from 1 to 10, but this one was a very easy for me 110 Stars.The movies title is true. The people in this film do not know ! Hands down, the worst movie I have ever seen.","label":0},{"index":6470,"txt":"I went into this film expecting it to be similar to The Matrix or Pi. Boy, was I wrong. Yes, there is a poorly written, poorly acted plot in the movie with CG animated cells and peptides to boot. However, the real focus of the film are the expert talking heads spewing out new age feelgood hogwash in between plot segments.Sure, it stars off innocently enough. There is a little bit of real quantum physics in the beginning. It states, for example, that electrons exist as both particle and wave, and that an atom is mostly empty space. However, the movie takes a giant and unscientific leap, saying that subatomic quantum effects happen on large scales as well. The talking heads take it even further. According to them, the following are trueWhen Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the natives were unable to see his ships because their minds were incapable of perceiving something so different. Meditation can reduce the murder rate. With positive thought, you can walk on water. Your thoughts can change the formations of ice crystals in bottles of water.And hey, that is only in the first 40 minutes!Watching the movie was torture. This film felt like a movie they would show you to get you to join a cult.

At the time I saw this film I was a high school studentI want to say junior year but it may have been senior, hard to remember. My experience with quantum physics goes pretty much to my honors physics course, an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read up on the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article I can find in Discover and the like. I am not a PhD by any means.That said...This movie is simply terrible. It is designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average New Age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everybody is. My mother is such a person and ever since she is seen this movie she is tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film. I attempted to point out the various flaws and problems I would seen with the films logic and scienceand they are numerousand she dismissed my claims because oh, so a high school student knows more than all those people with PhDs. In this case, apparently so.Leaving behind the fact that earning a PhD does not necessarily require that a person be correct or, in fact, intelligent. Leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half the film. Leaving that behind, the film makers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when, in fact, he completely opposed them.I could go on and on but I think intuitor did a really good job of debunking the film so feel free to read that if you care to do so.httpwww.intuitor.commoviephysicsbleep.html","label":0},{"index":6472,"txt":"At first glance this documentaryfictioncartoon is quite entertaining and thought provoking. Of course, when something provokes thought, it can then be scrutinized. The reality is this movie combines metaphysics with innuendo and baseless conclusions. The link that What the Bleep... would have you see between science and spirituality is, in fact, not rooted in science at all. The Transcendental Meditation study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a given area, Washington D.C. in this case. In reality the HRA Homicides, Rapes, and Assaults crime rate was about 30 higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 1988\u00961992. There was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate during the study. In fact, each and every claim that links metaphysics to science can and has been debunked.My conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a poor attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke. Either way, I suggest that you do not waste your time.If you are looking for a long winded movie about science that could provoke thoughts, you might consider Mindwalk 1990.","label":0},{"index":6473,"txt":"I agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film. I found it incredibly silly at best and downright misleading, misinforming and harmful at worst. Like others, I found this film to be an awful mix of real science and pseudoscientific, New Age propaganda. As a psychologist, I was especially offended by Candace Perts contributions. True, I was not a fan of hers before this film, but her discourse on the consciousness of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term consciousness that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify. It is an old Orwellian mindfk that the master himself described so well in his superb essay Politics and the English Language. To refer to consciousness in this mannerindeed, to refer to this film as based in science in general which is its clear intentis to use language in the same manner employed by Stalin when he labeled his slavestates democratic republics and Hitler when he called his party a socialist workers movement.I do not claim to really understand quantum physics. I know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study. Ah, but we Americans do love instant enlightenment, and that is what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish. If it ASKED questions, that would be one thing, but it clearly attempts to ask and ANSWER them, which no film could possibly do simply because we are far, far away from the answers if they indeed exist.By the way, ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several expert commentators with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and TM, not to mention J.Z. Knight, who often speaks in her Ramtha voice. I am always amazed at this channeled 10,000 yearold Atlantean supermans grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology. But then again, this film argues that the past, present and future are all one and the same, so if Ramtha existed in Atlantis 10,000 years ago, I suppose he could exist now and tomorrow. Only, then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers?

The attempt at a narrative in which they grounded their ideas was absolutely pathetic, which almost anyone will tell you. Marlee Matlin in her underwear just should not happen. I will not dwell on it. What I will reveal is a criticism that many are unable to formulate. This movie, while tedious, also suffered a tremendous flaw in reasoning. It was horribly contradictory because it took such a manipulative, become a creator of your life, manifestation of abundance, shoeless piece of propaganda. Interconnectivity is explained as a large party of our existence. However, the movie encourages that we control our surroundings with our minds. It completely neglects that there are other people with minds that could be controlling us, which seems to be more the case. Or at least the structures in which we exist greatly limit us. In this way, the movie was inappropriately solipsistic. Solipsism and interconnectivity just do not mix unless you are God almighty. If you are, you will be impressed ?!? by all the neat things this movie will reveal that You can do. If not, you will be sorely disappointed, a moron, or perhaps both.

The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about Quantum Physics in this mess is just plain wrong.Examples? Quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion. How? Well, in the world of the subatomic, you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time. You can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time. Also, the act of observation seems to affect the event. Solid particles can pass through barriers. All of this, so far, is accurate. But then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall, you could indeed do it. This is complete poppycock. Instead, the theory asserts that at our level, it is possible for you to walk through a wall, but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief. Also you would have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall, the odds are so astronomically against it.This is but one example of how they misrepresent the science. But much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer, played by Marlee Maitlan. About halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible. Something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and selfhate. There may be some truth to that, but Quantum physics has nothing to do with it.Plus, string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays. Instead of wasting your time with this dreck, I suggest you rent The Elegant Universe, an amazing series done for NOVA on PBS that gives you a history of physics from Newton and gravity to Ed Witten and M Theory in only 3 hourlong episodes.

This movie is an absolute dud.Having been recommended to me by a friend very much into that sort of thing, I watched this movie with some anticipation of being informed, changed, moved, altered, uplifted, and all the other positive mystical things that could happen to me when I suddenly see The Truth. Now this may sound like someone who is already predisposed to poopooing anything dealing with the metaphysical, the metaphysicalphysical boundaries of existence. Believe me, I am not such a person. I try to be open about any presentation and then decide accordingly.In terms of content, the only thing I found mildly interesting and informative, was the bit about peptides, emotions, addiction, and cellular receptors. That was the only unifying element I could find in the documentary part of this film. The rest of the documentary rambled around several topics and never seemed to unify and cohere, try to tie up and conclude to a point. And what was all that stuff about native Americans not being able to see the ships that Columbus came in? Who told the authorities in this film that that was what happened in 1492? Where they there too? Had they compared this to scientific work being done in visual cognition the famous gorilla video, for example, visit the Visual Cognition Lab at the University of Illinois site there may have been a more convincing point made. Here, however, it seemed like unsupported mystical mumbojumbo.As a film this was not one film, it was two. I found the documentary part mildly interesting, just to hear the people talking about what they were talking about I was annoyed that their credentials were not presented at the bottom of the screen when they spoke, at least initially! But I found the story part of the movie with Matlin in it annoying, disjointed, intrusive, nonrelated and downright stupid. That bit about the Polish wedding with that dance was not in the least bit funny. It was laughable, ludicrous, sophomoric, and stupid. And I found the use of the word Pollack offensive. It just seemed so out of place and wrong. Is such usage okay because a member of the group uses a pejorative term to refer to the group because he or she is a member of the group? That may be okay to make a point, but it did not seem to be used that way here. And in any case, I do not care what the reason, it offended me, a Pole. I never call myself or refer to my ethnic background as Pollack. And I certainly do not like like it when others do. Can I watch or listen to a bigoted conversation in which this term is used? You betcha! But again this did not seem to be the case here. It just seemed so out of place. Unprovocked, unmitigated.The acting was abysmal. Elaine Hendrixs performance was totally unbelievable. At times, it seemed like she was just reading her lines that had just been given to her. Marlee Matlin for the most part seemed to be sleep walking through this whole thing. Perhaps she was baffled by the material. I know I was. If she was supposed to be portraying a disillusioned druggedup anxietyprone malcontent, it just did not seem to click.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is impressive indeed, for I have seen many a bad movie.This masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts, alternating between a silly and contrived plot about an extremely annoying photographer, abandoned by her husband and forced to take antidepressants to survive, and a bunch of talking heads going on about how quantum physics supposedly justifies their newagy pseudophilosophy. Basically, if you start your day off meditating to the likes of Enya and Kenny G, this movie is for you. If you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who know how to have fun, and a sizable portion of good weed, then this movie is for you as well. Otherwise, stay away. Take my word for it.The first thing that struck me about What the Bleep do you Know is that is seemed to be edited and put together by the same kinds of people that shoot cheap weddings on camera, complete with pink heart effects, computergenerated sparkles across the screen, and other assorted silliness. Who let these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me. I guess this is what too much Kenny G does to you. The movie was permeated with cheesy GCI, the likes that you or I can produce on our own computer via overthecounter video editing software, but never would, because it is just way too ridiculous.The script was _obviously_ written by someone with no writing experience whatsoever. Not only were all the characters and conversations cumbersome and contrived beyond belief, but the writers felt like they had to shove every relevant piece of information, or rather disinformation, which is what most of this movie was all about, all the way down your throat. Well, given the target audience, that may not have been too bad of an idea. The main character, for example, spends half the movie popping pills. Apparently, though, it was deemed not convincing enough, so there are at least a couple of dialogs in throughout, which refer to her antianxiety pills specifically, just in case the viewers should not be able to connect her overacted pain and suffering with little white pills she takes whenever she feels down. The acting... Well, I have seen better acting in Ed Wood movies, and no, this is not an exaggeration. Heck, the little play I was in when I was 12 featured much more inspiring acting than this. It really did.The story is interrupted here and there with a bunch or random talking heads, a strange mix of kooky scientists, kooky doctors, and selfproclaimed mystics, go on and on about how quantum physics supposedly provides an explanation for how ever man or woman created their own reality just by participating in the experience of life. Reality, you see, is a probabilityfield of a bunch of different possibilities, and is only set in stone once you the Observer chose to notice it. What happens when more than one Observer Observes they did not say, but then again who cares. Listen to Enya, meditate, Observe, and you shall be God, and nobody gives a damn about such silly and archaic things as critical thinking, logic, etc. All reason is immediately dismissed as people being stuck in their ways and unable to achieve a paradigm shift and go down the rabbit hole. Furthermore, the Heidelberg Uncertainty Principle supposedly is proof positive of alternate realities, parallel universes, and such.Speaking of rabbit holes, the analogy permeates the movie. All of these people keep talking about going down rabbit holes. I am not sure what that had to do with anything else they were saying or showing, but one thing I am certain of is that it somehow involves anal sex. Actually, the movie is _extremely_ antisex. Throughout, sex is presented as dirty, ugly, and antienlightening.In any case, the talking heads talk, the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over her body with a magic marker, and proceeds to walk around with an even stupider look in her glazed over eyes than she started with.I want 2 hours of my life back.Heres a couple of random quotes which I happened to rememberWhat I think of as unreal has become a lot more real to me, and that, which I used to consider real, is oftentimes a lot less real than the unreal.

Consequently, they had even more trouble delivering it. They began by poorly describing principles of quantum physics which relate to subatomic particles. Having established a fuzzy picture of Heisenbergs Uncertainty Principle, they presented a barrage of talking heads who built a case of ridiculous logic intimating that every living person is an entity which follows the same quantum rules on a cosmic scale. Then there was a lot of talk about ideas upon which Stephen Covey and Tony Robbins have made their careers positive thinking, interrupting bad patterns, always look on the bright side, etc. Next came a bit about how our brains can change our bodies through production of proteins hormones which we more or less choose to create. If you are sad, you will create sad proteins. If you are happy, you will create happy proteins. It is just so simple, is not it? Interwoven with our lessons we follow the fictitious life of Amanda, a photographer who pops antidepressants and hates her thighs. The film makers slowly but surely were trying to get us all to say, Hey, Amanda, just cheer up! Why cannot she cheer up? Obviously it is because the world is a BAD place where there is crime and poverty and religion, that is why. The conclusion of the film which is basically the entire second half brought on a barrage of contradiction. We are all a part of a whole energy where we are not beings, but a collective consciousness, but we are individuals who can change the world, but there are many of each of us because of all the different dimensions, but we can choose who we are, and we have a purpose to do good, but there is no god because there is nothing better than us, so there is no such thing as right and wrong, so there is no such thing as reward or punishment, so nothing good ever came out of religion, but we should still do good anyway, even though there is no such thing as bad and good because there is nobody to decide what that is, except for the fact that we each can make life good if we all meditate, and then crime will cease, and if we say nice things, our water will freeze into pretty shapes. Still with me? Good because there is more. According to Robert L. Park in his book Voodoo Science, the whole meditation experiment put on by John Hagelin in Washington, D.C. was a farce, the numbers were doctored, and the murder rate was higher that year that any year before or since. And what about your positive attitude keeping you young and healthy? This was a message delivered by an older man who looked his age and a woman who was overweight.So does all this work or not? I was lucky enough to see the film at a theater where Betsy Chasse, one of the films three directors yes, three fielded questions following the show. I call myself lucky because I had firsthand confirmation that these people do not know what they are talking about. Several of the questions asked by audience members had her so stumped that her husband, a chiropractor, had to step in and recite the answer. I finally had to leave when the discussion inevitably turned political, and everyone, including Ms. Chasse, began speculating as to how wonderful the world would be if only President Bush could see this movie.","label":0},{"index":6490,"txt":"This movie made me very angry. I wanted desperately to throttle the scientists and unseen filmmakers during the course of it. Very, very painful to sit through. Sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way.

Mr. Dispenza informs us that most people lead lives of mediocrity and clearly implies that he, on the other hand, is living on a higher plane. Even the ideas and attitudes that I basically agree with are presented in such a heavy handed, clumsy, superior, pretentious, preachy manner that I felt the desire to disavow them. I think that is what made me so angry, the fact that they have taken what are indeed profound aspects of established scientific thought and marred them with their new age hokum. Much of it is based around the fallacy of applying concepts of quantum theory to the macro world. Fittingly, the dramatized portions with Marlee Matlin are amateurish and clich\u00e9 ridden.I would refer people instead to Bill Brysons excellent survey of science A Brief History of Nearly Everything.

Knowing nothing of it, I am excited, hoping that the information will be presented well.I have done REAL quantum mechanics; this was not it.This movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can, and will, occur to you, if you just open your eyes. Let us think about that, for just a moment.Our bodies are composed of somewhere around 1030 such subatomic particles. That is a million billion billion billion particles! The more mysterious quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50 probability of cancelling each other out completely. As you add more and more particles into the mix, it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result. To tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption, with no rationality behind it...it is just stupid.My friend, also in physics, and I counted 3 facts during the course of this movie.

Not to ruin the invaluable plot that drives this movie, but the main character goes to a wedding, where she sees all different types of personalities driven by their peptides, and then the film cuts to the dance floor, where we are spliced between people dancing, sometimes surrounded by CG peptides, and a fully CG scene, filled with dancing peptides. The film, at that point, was trying to tell us how we are addicted to emotions, so we are treated to the full song of that smash hit, Addicted to Love.This scene was redeeming, because anyone who could go through THAT scene, and still take this movie seriously...well, you are the ones that need to open your eyes.","label":0},{"index":6492,"txt":"I had numerous problems with this film.It contains some basic factual information concerning quantum mechanics, which is fine. Although quantum physics has been around for over 50 years, the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to be saying Are not you just blown away by this! Well, not really. These are not earth shattering revelations anymore. At any rate, I was already familiar with quantum theory, and the fact that particles have to be described by wave equations, etc. is not new.The main problem I have with this movie, however, is the way these people use quantum theory as a way of providing a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism. I do not have any serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism, but quantum mechanics does not really have anything to do with these things, and it should be kept separate. The people they interviewed for this movie start with the ideas of quantum theory and then make the leap to say that simply by thinking about something you can alter the matter around you, hence we should think positively so as to have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better. The reasoning is completely ridiculous, and the conclusions do not logically follow from quantum theory. For every so called expert that they interviewed for this film, there are scores of theoretically physicists who would completely disagree. They would point out, quite rightly, that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not lend support to mystical notions about our spiritual connectedness.It disturbs me that people are going to see this film and completely eat it up because it leaves them with a nice positive feeling. The main thrust of the film is based on a total misinterpretation of quantum theory, and it is as bad in its reasoning as any attempt to justify organized religion with similar pseudoscientific arguments.Avoid this film.Oh yeah. At one point, one of the experts says that since throughout history most of the assumptions people have made about the world turned out to be false, therefore the assumptions we currently hold about the world are also likely to be false. Huh? That totally does not follow. And even if it did, I do not see how that helps his argument.

McKenna has been kidnapped and locked in a dark bare shack. He knows he is going to be clobbered half to death in the following days. He is literally invited the heavies to do it. What would you do in this Poelike situation? Heres what McKenna does on what may turn out to be the last night of his life.

A house blows up in an explosive fireball at the end while the hero, McKenna, walks towards us in the foreground.Some hero he is, too. He first kills a man for 13,000 by bashing him over the head several times with a heavy statue, then a potted plant, before finally tipping a refrigerator over onto the body. This bothers him a little, but not enough to keep him from insisting on payment. Then, I hope I have the order straight, he kills Wendt by ripping out part of his neck. Then he kills the wife of his first victim by accident and blames the heavies for it, although by almost any moral calculus they had nothing to do with it. Next he burns the head honcho Baldwin alive. Then, having disabled the two lesser heavies, he deliberately blows them up, though one of them is not entirely unsympathetic. And we are supposed to be rooting for McKenna.These are not cartoon deaths like those in the Dirty Harry movies either  bang bang and you are dead. These are slow and painful.

Norm Peterson aka George Wendt must really be in a rut to have agreed to do this movie. The acting was deplorable and the story was even worse. As a sane minded and rational individual, I could not understand where the writer came from nor where he was going with this movie. There was ineptness on the part of every main character, there was a string of hapless and ridiculous events, then the movie ended. One absurd act after another with dialogue does not make a movie, it only makes a talkative train wreck.","label":0},{"index":6505,"txt":"This movie is written by Charlie Higson, who has before this done the legendary Fast Show and his own show based on one of Fast Show is characters Tony the car sales man. He is also written James Bond books for kids.Actually I have seen before this only Gordons movies that are based on Lovecrafts stories, and every one of those is marvelous. Here Gordon tries to do something different. The style is totally contemporary, which means shaky camera, fast and strange cutting, cool chillout music in the background. It works quite well here, I guess, but it is still pointless and cheap. It makes me often think of the cameraman who is shaking his dvcamera in front of the actorsactresses and try to make stylish moves in the pictures hoping that something tolerable would come out of it. The casting is good, and there is a whole atmosphere, which is the result of good directing. I think the main character, the zero young guy, is quite interesting in his zeroness. The fat guy is also good. And the guy who looks like Alec Baldwin, but is not him. But pretty soon after the beginning the movie turns out to be something notsointeresting In this case I mean an endless line of scenes of sadism and sickness. There is not much humanity in this filmstory It is totally pessimistic, and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless, or soon dead. Needless to say that there is no humor either. It is a 140 long vomit without no relief in any moment. Anyway, Gordon remains to me one of the most interesting movie makers that are active today, and I think of this movie as an experiment, and as a failure in that. Everyone has to experience getting lost sometimes, just to learn and to find their way again. This might be Gordons most uninteresting and empty work.","label":0},{"index":6506,"txt":"This movie was an attempt to go into places most do not and perhaps should not venture into. It was a similar trial at the bizarre, headcase perspective given to us in The Cell, although not near as indepth and well portrayed. The plot is constructed simply with an initial campy feel to it. Then, as the movie takes its supposed dramatic turn, the plot falls apart on what few legs it had to stand on in the first place. Basically the idea is that of a kid Chris McKenna who needs money. He takes on the role of a hit man, killing a city accountant. Then he does not get paid for his work but instead gets tortured for several days because he dreamed up the brilliant idea of trying to use a backup file he had as leverage for payment. This idiotic move at trying to force them to pay him backfires as he is horribly and endlessly abused. He begins to go crazy some very disturbing scenes. Then, thinking he has paid for his sins and can start over, he visits the wife Kari Wuhrer of the man who he killed and wins her affections. Soon after she discovers who he is, tragedy strikes, and revenge sweeps through the air as the boy goes after his torturers Daniel Baldwin, George Wendt, Vernon Wells for their previous kindness.I got to ask though, what is it with Kari Wuhrer and horrorgore type films?It seems everything she has put out lately has been in this genre. Granted, I liked her in EightLegged Freaks and she was okay in Anaconda. But despite all her obvious cuteness and allure wow, she is hot!, she can act much better and chose better roles. Or maybe, I am wrong and that is just a misconception. For all you guys out there, you get to see the fully monty of her in this film, although it is rather bizarre and shortlived. I almost felt like she did some softporn after watching this film something not foreign to Karis career. The sexsimulation is such that it has to make you wonder what things really go on during filming. Anyway, I will say there is some good acting. Just do not expect much of it from Daniel Balwin, whose career seems forever destined to second his brother Alexs. The film did bring out a few old greats though, George Wendt Norm from Cheers and Vernon Wells Commando, Weird Science. Above all, Chris McKenna does the best job in playing the main character, Sean Crawley. His little acting experience and yet his believable nature as a naive youth, bring some elements of substance to the film. I would not go out of my way for this one. If you are bored and are tired of the same old episodes of The Hitchhiker, then I might advise watching this.And Kari, please start acting in some better films!","label":0},{"index":6507,"txt":"You cannot imagine how I looked forward to King of the Ants. As a massive Gordon fan, I awaited the European premiere with wicked anticipation.especially since I loved Dagon  Gordons last achievement  so much. King of the Ants premiered here in my country and it was Gordon himself who came to present it. Unfortunately, I could not go and congratulate him for it afterwards. King of the Ants is his most uninspired and mediocre film to date. Really, the quality level never surpassed ordinary TVthriller standards. The plot outline is terribly routine and with the exception of a few poor scenes, the typical Gordontouch is never recognized. On top of that, the already weak script has more holes than a Swiss bowl of cheese! It involves a young wannabecrook who is hired to commit a murder. So he does.and of course they are not paying him.and of course he falls in love with the victims wife.and of course he avenges himself.. Only the sequences in which the guy descents in a spiral of madness are worth a mention and they are the only ones reminding you of the fact you are still watching a Stuart Gordon film. The acting performances are below average with McCenna as the heroic lowlife, George Norm Peterson Wendt as the chubby bastard and Kari Wuhrer as the goodhearted sex bomb. Extremely illogical things happen constantly and the dullness of the story becomes irritating very quickly, while the makeup effects are not enough to even satisfy amateurhorror fans. I read a few other comments on King of the Ants, claiming it is Gordons best since it finally is a thoughtprovoking and mature film.Well, if that is the case.I rather stay immature and give ReAnimator another viewing, thank you very much.

Later, I found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get, and each time it got...more... ridiculous.Sean Crawley goodlooking Chris L. McKenna, whom I have never seen before  but LOVED his little nude sceneis making ends meet as a painter, when he meets electrician Duke Wayne George Wendt from Cheers. Thinking he is getting more work from Duke, Sean agrees to meet contractor Ray Matthews Daniel Baldwin, playing a stereotypically evil guy. Ray is being investigated by a City Hall accountant Ron Livingston in a cameo, who I have been in love with from Office Space up to Sex  the City. Ray end up offering the apparently desperatefor cash Sean 13k to kill the accountant, and Sean accepts the job. Sean stalks out the accountant, whose wife Kari Wuhrer he finds himself attracted to, completes the hit, and leaves  taking the file of information against Ray with him. Sean quickly learns he was being used, that Ray never intended to pay him, and Sean uses the file as leverage to get his money.Up to this point, it is a descent flick...generally worth watching. But as soon as Ray, Duke and their crew kidnap Sean to muscle the information about the file out of him, it just got dumber and dumber and still DUMBER..., until finally it seemed like the films writer, Charlie Higson, had snapped out of a 10day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something. Without simply detailing the movie, let us just say that in everysinglescene you watch after the kidnapping, you find yourself gasping what the fK!, baffled by the ongoing nonsense as Sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption. In the end, so many looseends are left in the movie, that you begin to regret that you even watched it.This is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable, and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it is full value. It is supposed to be a psychological thriller, and McKenna is a decent actor, but it is hard to give yourself to the movie when you have Norm from Cheers and a Baldwin brother doing the dirty work, and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense. Guys will love the violence, blood and guts scenes, and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots. Girls will enjoy handsome Seans gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie, when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie.

What angered me most about the movie was the main plot line, which pretty much completely plagiarized Beavis  Butthead Do America in which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to do his wife, not realizing they are expected to assassinate her.

She is still beautiful, and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material I always see her in. This is no different. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but that does not make it good. George Wendt played against type, and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role. Another note about Ms. Wuhrer. Her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since I saw her last. Perhaps reduction surgery, or more likely removal of implants. This NOT a bad thing. She still looks great.

Not because it is abysmal or because given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it really ought to deserve them but because in every category it was nominated Prizzis Honor disappoints. Some would argue that old Hollywood pioneer John Huston had lost it by this point in his career but I do not buy it. Only the previous year he signed the superb UNDER THE VOLCANO, a dark character study set in Mexico, that ranks among the finest he ever did. Prizzis Honor on the other hand, a film loaded with star power, good intentions and a decent script, proves to be a major letdown.The overall tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a female hitman prefigures the quirky crimedies that caught Hollywood by storm in the early 90s but the script is too convoluted for its own sake, the motivations are off and on the whole the story seems unsure of what exactly it is trying to be a romantic comedy, a crime drama, a gangster saga etc. Jack Nicholson doing a Brooklyn accent that works perfectly for De Niro but sounds unconvincing coming from Jack and Kathleen Turner in the leading roles seem to be in paycheck mode, just going through the motions almost sleepwalking their way through some parts. Anjelica Huston on the other hand fares better but her performance is sabotaged by her characters motivations she starts out the victim of her bigot fathers disdain, she proves to be supportive to her exhusband, then becomes a vindictive bitch that wants his head on a plate.The colours of the movie have a washedup quality like it was made in the early 70s and Hustons direction is as uninteresting as everything else.

Can anyone tell me where the humour is in Prizzis Honor? It is certainly tasteless the shooting in the head of a policemans wife is but another supposedly comic interlude in this intended farce about mafia life but with the exception of a joke about your favourite Mexican cigars which I imagine is an old joke for Americans who have been officially forbidden from buying anything Cuban for the last 50 years I failed to spot anything of a comic nature  and I did try. There is a lot of Mafia clich\u00e9 but clich\u00e9 does not constitute humour in my book.Is it a romantic comedy of sorts? Never. The characters and their relationships are so completely incredible and shallow that they are on a par with Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli.Is it a cleverly devised parody about the Mafia? Not in a million years. The plot is just pointlessly absurd rather than comically absurd, and it usually just has the feel of a really bad and cheap Mafia movie. It feels more like a homage than a parody.With onedimensional characters and little in the way of humour written for them, the actors are left doing dodgy accents and pulling faces. Well it is not enough; even when the face is being pulled by that master of the comic facial expression, Jack Nicholson repleat with puffed up top lip ... now is that meant to be a parody of Brandos padded jowls in The Godfather?... Oh!

Griffith referred to the Chinese character in Broken Blossoms as the yellow man; characters so unimaginative and unengaging that it is difficult to watch as well as a narrative that plods along at such a slow, stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this film.Prizzis Honor is a film that ends up being an absolute postmodern disaster in every which way possible. The film is a messy and senseless disaster that has John Huston directing; Kathleen Turner and Jack Nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes or supporting characters that weep on a phone now and again or bicker with a main character. Prizzis Honor is a film that falls into a genre of neonoir, comedy, romance, action, gangster and overall crime \u0096 this twinned with its director and cast should be enough to propel it through some sort of a story; some sort of a sequence of good scenes; some sort of intelligence in the form of a screenplay or something else but no \u0096 what we get is a nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at all.I will give a couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is. Firstly, the film thinks it is a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time of MY time. Charley Partanna Nicholson is an assassin who kills people for a family that he works for in New York and yet he resembles his character out of One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest more than an international hitman. He meets and falls in love with Irene Walker Turner who is another assassin and they hit it off but as the poor excuse for a plot plays out, it appears all is not right. I read that the plot for this film is A professional hit man and hit woman fall in love, only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other. Well, yes that is true but that actual revelation does not happen until about twenty minutes to the end! Nicholson plays Partanna like someone with an IQ of 60 he walks around; seemingly making observations and talking out loud about things he sees; he talks like he is either drunk or has a more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling he is an assassin \u0096 one really poorly shot assassination early on that actually happens off screen is not enough to suggest this guy is a hardbodied, best of the best, international hitman.So with a main character who is unlikable and unrealistic, we move to the script. The first hour and a half is just a cinematic dead zone with what ever there is to suggest traces of life merely poor conventions Partanna slouches around on the phone or in person asking the same things over and over again Do I marry her?; Do I love her? What is love? What do I do? and it gets so repetitive, it is not even able to act as good humour. This twinned with the way he always seemed to be on the phone to someone a girl called Maerose Prizzi Huston played by director Johns daughter; which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with Partanna and loved it \u0096 that got me thinking, was this supposed to be funny? Should I be laughing? The film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding al\u00e1 The Godfather and consequential scenes with a touch of noir as gangsters, police men and assassins were introduced into the film. But what we get is something very, very different.The second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot; right, the love and romance is dealt with \u0096 maybe the film will kickstart. I was so very wrong with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a monotone way, we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of his office this scene sums the film up. Everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy. We do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music; perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevators; maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs \u0096 the scene is not even edited correctly. Some suspense, some drama Do I shoot or do not I?; maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before it is too late \u0096 anything but how it was actually executed. Prizzis Honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion as it nears its climax. It is a film where cameras reflect in windows; lights reflect in sides of cars and dead chauffeurs blink when nudged. Prizzis Honor is a jumbled and messy film that will try the patients of any filmgoer and do not say it was a comedy because I did not laugh with it \u0096 AT it is another matter. The film is repetitive, drawn out and colourless in its vision and scope for originality  there is no Honour here.","label":0},{"index":6520,"txt":"Let me state first that I love Westerns  Civil War stories.

They make mention of the awful conditions of the Andersonville prison, At the time of the movie Andersonville was not in operation. They also use rifles that were not used at the time.John Ford was directing films for over 40 years  won 4 Oscars. He must have been ill during the making of this.His usual style was missing. It could be that this was film in the south  east and not in Monument Valley.He normally had a stock company of players he used in nearly all his film, MOST were missing this time. This time only minor cowboy stars Hoot Gibson  Ken Curtiss have roles  of course Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other familiar faces except for the 3 stars. see below Mr. Fords stock company made most of his films the classics they were; sadly missed here.Now we come to the main stars John Wayne  William Holden. The Duke also must have been ill,he seemed out of place here. This sort of role usually fit his style perfectly, he was just adequate here. Wiliam Holden did the best he could, but nowhere as good as he usually was.It was required that there be an actress in this type of movie. Here in her first major role second film is Constance Towers, a very beautiful person, But not really an actress, She is still having roles on Television.

I did not think much of THE CRAFT and I am not into CHARMED either. The only film I more or less enjoyed about teenage witches was LITTLE WITCHES 1996, and even that one was not very good. But changes are that if you liked all the aforementioned movies, you will also enjoy MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS.I was expecting a silly and cheesy early 80s movie about teenage witches in high school. But I was rather surprised that this whole movie plays it rather serious. The acting is decent and serious all the time. No jokes are being played by teenagers or something. And the musical score, at first, I thought was pretty good. It added some scariness and also something classy, with the use of threatening violins and all. But as the movie progressed I came to the conclusion that the score was just too ambitious. They did not have to add those threatening violins when you simply see someone back up a car and then drive away at normal speed.Then there is Melissa Sue Anderson, who was the main reason for me to see this movie. A few weeks ago, I saw her in HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME, a rather enjoyable, thickplotted and goofy on some occasions slashermovie which she had done in the same year as MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS. And I must say, she was very good as the icycold bad witch Vivian. But the main problem with the movie is almost nothing happens! Vivian causes a death and an accident, yes, but that is it. Then there is Robin, the good witch, who is just learning about her powers. And we expect the two of them using their powers more than once, but at only one occasion they use their powers to make some pieces of wood and other stuff fly through the air as projectiles. That was supposed to be a fight between two powerful witches? And what is worse, I was hoping to see a spectacular showdown between the witches at the end of the movie with at least some special effects, flaming eyes or whatever... but nothing happens. There is sort of a confrontation in the end, but it is a big disappointment.So, the acting of the two witches was good. The musical score was decent even though overly ambitious. And the cinematography was rather dark and moody at times. But that does not make a good movie yet, does it?","label":0},{"index":6529,"txt":"Cheap, amateurish, unimaginative, exploitative... but do not think it will have redeeming amusement value.

Downloading Nancy is no exception. It is supposedly based on a true story about a woman who is murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet.The protagonist is Nancy Maria Bello who is married to Albert Rufus Sewell. Albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and barrestaurants. Unlike most human beings, Albert has virtually no positive attributes except for his ability to be successful in the business world. Throughout the film, Albert has a grim and dour expression on his face. He has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes. When his wife asks for sex, he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead.Nancy is equally onenote as a character. Not only has she had a loveless 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film. Her selfloathing takes the form of selfmutilation and a result, she is forced into therapy. However, she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made.Finally, Nancy is so depressed that she contacts Louis over the internet. He is sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo, who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot. It is revealed that Louis has two children but no longer sees them the childrens mother no longer wants anything to do with him.Nancys plan is to first have painful sex with Louis and then have him kill her. There is a particularly unpleasant scene where Louis has sex with Nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass. These scenes are shown as flashbacks after Louis pays a visit to Albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club. It seems that Louis has a twofold plan in going to see Albert 1 berate him for his treatment of Nancy and 2 enjoy the beating he receives. It takes awhile before Louis will reveal Nancys fate\u0097first, he forces Albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future. Nancys fate of course is that Louis finally ended up choking her to death but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some feelings for her. We soon learn that Louis is imprisoned for life for Nancys murder.What exactly are we to take away from a film such as Downloading Nancy? Are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence? Is that the main point of the film? Is sympathy for Nancy actually warranted? I do not think so. The films writers create a straw man in the character of Albert\u0097someone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for Nancys decline. But are people so onedimensional in real life? I think not. They have the repulsive Louis, a man who makes a living by inflicting pain, come over and berate Albert for neglecting Nancy. Furthermore, his expressions of love towards Nancy before he kills her, is supposed to show his sensitive side.In the end, it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film. They are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence, that Downloading Nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography.","label":0},{"index":6537,"txt":"obviously has some talent attached, Maria Bello is always great. but this is just a dreary wast of time, portraying every character as someone to be loathed and exploited so someone could make a movie out of an interesting story. well, i hope they got it out of their systems. unfortunately for the audience, there is no insight, no sensitivity, no context, and really no humanity. which would all be fine, except it has no humor, no horror, no context, and nothing constructive to say about the story it is trying to tell. bad things happen, you sit and watch it, you do not care, so what? 99 of the time, the words based on a true story constitute an unintentional warning to the audience. it means the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they heard about somewhere, so they just throw them up on the screen and expect the true nature of the story to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers having to do any of the work. i hope they had a great time making this movie. it stinks on ice.","label":0},{"index":6538,"txt":"There is nothing particularly original about this story of corrupt unions on one side and the chief attorney on the other. The stark but unimaginative lighting and photography stems from the fagged out noir cycle. The story could easily have been out of a Warner Brothers drawer with George Raft in the lead. The performances are routine, the direction flat, and even the set dressing perfunctory. An alley is shown by a single plaster wall of simulated brick. It has one poster on it. The poster says, Post No Bills. We are introduced to the story and some of the characters by a portentous narrator who informs us that, while most unions work hard and honestly to advance the causes of their members, a few are corrupt. But we do not really get to know much about the unions or how they operate, although I suppose they were fair game after the success of On the Waterfront a few years earlier. Here they are just a peg to hang the tale on. The real ring leader is a disbarred lawyer who runs things through three or four thugs. The District Attorney or whatever he is finds out, like Dana Andrews did in Boomerang, that the wrong man Dick Foran is charged with a murder and he spends the rest of the film almost alone, digging up evidence of Forans innocence. He gets into fist fights and shoot outs like any inexpensive movie private eye.Brian Keith is the D.A. He is shown some insinuating displays of talent elsewhere, but here he spends most of the time speaking quietly and staring at the floor. Elisha Cook, Jr., is a likable rummy but cannot do a good drunk. Beverley Garland is okay but is undermined by the direction, which has her gawking in a night club when she should be furtive. The remainder of the cast would be suitable for a TV series.And nobody is helped by the writing. When a B girl is about to be shipped by the union mob to the Filippines, someone advises her that she only has to learn a few words of Spanish. I only know one word, she says, Si. Yes. The writers have not trusted the audience to know that si in Spanish means yes. The plot is clumsy and has holes in it. Keith visits a witness in her flat over a night club. He enters the door and has a gun shoved in his back by a yegg, but he outwits the heavy and knocks him out. Then the orders someone to call the police. The rest of the scene, played out at some length in the night club downstairs, forgets all about the police and they never show up, nor are they expected by anyone.It is nothing to be ashamed of, and some people might enjoy it, but there is similar stuff, better done, elsewhere.","label":0},{"index":6539,"txt":"The Confidential part was meant to piggyback on the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name, while the labor racketeering theme tied in with headline Congressional investigations of the day.

What is needed to offset the poor production values is some imagination, especially from uninspired director Sidney Salkow. A few daylight location shots, for example, would have helped relieve the succession of dreary studio sets. A stylish helmsman like Anthony Mann might have done something with the thickear material, but Salkow treats it as just another payday exercise. Too bad that Brian Keiths typical lowkey style does not work here, coming across as merely wooden and lethargic, at the same time cult figure Elisha Cook Jr. goes over the top as a wildeyed drunk. Clearly, Salkow is no actors director. But, you have got to hand it to that saucy little number Beverly Garland who treats her role with characteristic verve and dedication.

Research chemist Rich Stevens Mark Sawyer, whose eyes were destroyed when acid flew into his face during a lab explosion, is the unlucky recipient of the werewolfs eyeballs. It takes awhile to get to the first full moon, so first we get a tender love story between Rich and his compassionate, bigbreasted nurse Sondra Gard Stephanie Beaton. Sondra is so compassionate that she strips off her clothing and starts riding Rich in bed before he even has a chance to remove his bandages! After a month in the hospital, Rich returns home to icy wife Rita Deborah Huber, who promptly tells him You look pretty ugly before speeding off in her Kia. Our hero soon discovers that Rita is not only a bitch, but an adulterous skank who is been carrying on an affair with his supposed friend Craig Lyndon Johnson. Finally, the full moon rises and Rich finds himself in a hairy predicament as he transforms into a very silly looking werewolf creature. Predictable carnage ensues.After ripping out Craigs throat on a beach, Rich wakes up in the brush the next morning with his clothes tattered and vague recollections of the evenings events. He makes friends with dwarf psychicoccult expert Andros Kurt Levi and is hassled by both local author Siodmak Jason Clark and lesbianpolicedetectiveinapantssuit Justine Evers Tarri Markel. When Rich confronts Dr. Atwill, the doctor sends his sadistic bald henchman Kass Eric Mestressat, who gets a kick out of dismembering corpses with a machete at the clinic, after him. With help from Sondra, Rich manages to escape. Sondra takes him back to her place and basically rapes him on the couch during an overlong sex scene that lasts about five minutes. Will Rich be able to control his lycanthropy or find a cure for it before he claims more victims? Shot on the cheap with a camcorder, this homemade werewolf flick has a somewhat unique premise with the eye transplant angle, but trots out clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9 otherwise. The sets are sub porn level  the clinic scenes seem to have been filmed inside someones home or apartment. The wolf transformation scenes do not even look as good as the time lapse photography used way back in the 1940s. Instead, they employ ragged editing. Throw some hair on the actor. Cut. Throw on some more on. Cut. More fur... and fill his mouth full of white gunk he can spit out. Cut. No need to worry about continuity! There is no fade, no dissolve, nothing. It is pretty sloppy. Once fully transformed, the werewolf costume designed by Jeff Leroy, who also edited and shot the movie is pretty awful. It has red, glowing Christmas bulb eyes, fur that looks like shag carpet and a plastic face that is almost completely immobile. There are several times you can see the cameramans fingers in front of the camera lens, and does the moon really stay full five nights in a row? As far as the cast is concerned, they are amateurish, but tolerable. And as far as B horror flicks are concerned, there are worse out there.

Sterling CAMP BLOOD, who was one of the first to ride the wave of digital video right when it was first starting to dominate the lowbudgetindependent horror genre scene back in the midlate 90s. Many of his notoriously awful productions were released by Brain Damage Films, a label to avoid like the plague for the most part. Fx guy Jeff Leroy who is listed as codirector here at IMDb, but not in the films actual credits and Vinnie Bilancio who appears in a small role as one of the hunters went on to make the much more fun and polished exploitation flick WEREWOLF IN A WOMENS PRISON in 2006, which had a similarlooking creature on display red glowing eyes and all.","label":0},{"index":6542,"txt":"Eyes of the Werewolf 1999 is a really bad movie.

It basically is a movie to belittle blondes and to record the whole repetoir of blonde jokes.To sum it all up, this movie is blonde humor gone bad, it is not worth paying any amount of money to watch, it is just that bad.","label":0},{"index":6555,"txt":"With a cast of stalwart British character actors and pleasing photography of 1950s Britain, I had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this film.

The recognizable cast is hit and miss, with Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and the underused Billy Dee Williams faring best. Stephen Boyd, however, stops just short of twirling his bushy mustache in an overindulgent star turn.The obviously low budget leads to inconsistency in the production values.

Yet, the denouement, with the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their accomplishment because they are black, and Boyds racist Captain being effected by this, is compelling, as are the sequences of of Turmans character writing in a journal of his imagined exploits if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines.In short, Black BrigadeCarters Army does not quite succeed.

The Heiress, starring Olivia de Havilland, remains as a wellrespected piece of work, though less true to James original story than this new remake, which retains James original title. It is the story of a awkward, yet loving daughter Leigh, devoted to her father Finney after her mother dies during childbirth. The arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever, and considers her, as well as all women, simpleminded. When a young man Chaplin of good family and little fortune comes courting, the Father is naturally suspicious, but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man, is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him. Leigh is a controversial actress \u0096 most either love her or hate her \u0096 and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style, like she is acting through gritted teeth. She is not bad in this, and she handles her role relatively deftly \u0096 it is just an awkward role for any actress, making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses. While the character garners a lot of sympathy, she is not particularly likable. The very handsome and immensely appealing Ben Chaplin previously seen in The Truth About Cats and Dogs plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune, or is really in love with her. Maggie Smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the wellmeaning aunt. Finney is marvelous, of course, as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience, but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves. But does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune? This is only one instance where Washington Square differs from The Heiress. Another instance is the ability to stick with it.

Indeed, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James masterpieces. Moreover its simple, eventless story seems unsuited to make it into a film although William Wyler, with his The Heiress, gave in 1949 a beautiful version of the novel. Anyway, the movie completely betrays the spirit of this work of the great American writer. In the novel, the heroine Catherine is shy, not very attractive and somewhat clumsy, but nonetheless she is a sound, intelligent young woman, and she is not as naive as it may seem. Her attachment for her father is dignified and respectful, with no morbid sides in it. Along three quarters of the movie, Catherine Jennifer Jason Leigh just seems to be mentally retarded, poor thing. In the last quarter, she suddenly and incredibly becomes intelligent, aware of her dignity as a woman, and all that.The director Agnieszka Holland has added two vulgar scenes to the story. The first, when the nervous child Catherine has, well, troubles with her vesica. The second scene, when we see on the background a sort of openair brothel, with prostitutes taking their customers behind tents, and so on. Nothing could be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of Henry James. It is notorious that the writer was extremely decent and demure even for the standards of the Victorian age. I defy anyone to find any coarseness anywhere in the thousands of pages of James huge literary production. I really was particularly annoyed by these two scenes.Yes, I know that a director needs reasonable freedom in the screen adaptation of a novel. But if a director utterly ignores or misunderstands the art of an author here Henry James, I do not see the point of using his work to make a bad movie.

Just like Melies A Trip to the Moon, critics have hailed this as being the film that introduced the western genre into modern cinema. In my eyes, they were right. It had everything from the planning, the actual heist of the train, the murder of an unwanted civilian, and that looming final scene that makes you realize that these villains mean business \u0096 it was all monumental for its time. From here to Eastwood, every western filmmaker has used Porters image in some form or another to create their own story. One cannot say that this film did not open the door, but the struggle comes from the story itself. The genre was defined by Porter, but outside of its initial excitement \u0096 there really is not anything to grapple onto. Perhaps I am jaded by the clich\u00e9 modern westerns and their haphazard messages, but how can something be clich\u00e9 before being clich\u00e9? To me, The Great Train Robbery seemed forced, untraceable, and unsurprising.Unlike Melies, Porter tells a very linear story. Robbers change the course of a train, rob it, then shoot at random people just to prove they are the true villains, and the final scene ends like any predestined film, without any surprises or glitches, and that looming man with a gun to your proverbial face. It is bland. Porters film is boring. In the edition I watched, there was an addition of color near to the end to emphasize emotion, which felt cheap and was not encouraging to the filmmaker, or to the viewer. The issue remains that while it is important, Porters film has been borrowed time and time again, it has in effect become diluted. The story itself does not carry the emotional powerhouse it once has. Unlike Melies early film, I cannot watch this again. I know what has happened, I know there is very little missing from behind the scenes, and that finally it is just what it has set out to be \u0096 a simple story leading from point A to point B to point C. This issue is not only my gripe with this film, but also the strongest element to see in such an early film. While it was dull, the fact that it told such a strong narrative \u0096 that our characters were characters with motives and drives, was outstanding to see. In an era where nonfiction films seemed mainstream, this broke the mold. Again, not that I am jumping on the prophetic bandwagon about this film \u0096 it is an important film \u0096 it just is not a great film.Overall, I was eager to jump into this film to see where the roots of the western genre were planted, but I was equally as happy to leave this film behind. Porter is a talented director, and G.M. Anderson obviously went on to be very successful in the created field, but I just was not in awe of the film. I was not expecting big budget effects like Melies work, nor was I expecting a duplicate of A Trip to the Moon, but I did want to see the same creativity, exploration, and originality. I felt Porter played it safe, if that can be said with such an early film, but I could not feel the excitement as our villains did their evil deeds. I was not rooting for anyone, and the final conclusion proved that the kitschyness of it had worn off minutes after the film started. It was pioneering, but not monumental. The Great Train Robbery has lost its space in the time capsule of cinema.Grade  out of ","label":0},{"index":6584,"txt":"What a load of Leftist Hollywood bilge.

Maybe the ending of the cold war had everything to do with it but I found this set up very unconvincing .

The story does improve somewhat when the story proper  A battle of wills concerning orders between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two  gets underway .

The responsibility they carry is awesome and they take it very seriously all the way from the Captain to the most junior crew member. I could never see a crew of any ship split their alliance between the Captain and the Executive Officer. An Executive Officer who acted as the Character played by Denzel Washington did would be relieved of his duties and Court Martialed, then drummed from the Navy. It is no surprise the Navy refused to send a technical adviser to help in making this film. Lastly, if any member of a submarine crew made the amount of noise made underway on this vessel they would be severely reprimanded. Submariners learn early in their career to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. They do not slam doors and even speak quietly and wear soft soled shoes when underway. I was amazed at how loud they portrayed the crew while underway. Loud music would never be tolerated.

The Captain, Gene Hackman, is all for launching, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, is in favor of confirming the launch orders first. The problem is, to launch BOTH the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys. Hackman is determined to launch and Washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub. Eventually, the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not launched. Cool. However, here comes the part that just does not ring true.

Films that are serious and more educational can have an effect, but it appears this one did not have any effect whatsoever on the class  whenever the teacher left, conversations quickly started  and I did not hear the words Shakespeare or Tempest being used at all. And when you look at this, it is easy to see why. The acting is nothing special  everyone seems bored to bits, just reading from the page without a care in the world. Shakespeare always did prefer expository dialogue to action and death, but I just could not understand a word anyone was saying. The costumes are not too bad and neither are the special effects  the class may not have loved the film, but they were not exactly taking the pss either. But it is hard to joke at a film that is devoid of any sort of inspiration or joy. The scenes on the ship at the start of the film were not too badly done  though the rain looked a bit unrealistic, everything else was done well and good. But where were the severed heads and exploding masts? Where was the death? Where was the inspiration? The character of Ariel would have been taken a lot more seriously had he been wearing clothes  but as all was on show, he was just another excuse for a joke. This film is not in any way appealing to either sex. The women and girls will not have any romance or comedy to enjoy, and there is an abundance of naked men and lack of action or death that will put most men and boys off.

Why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines? For that matter, what time period are we talking about here? WWII or postwar?? I assumed the latter which makes bombers motive even more salient.

And since the movie received an R rating, I expected to see her nude. Alas, no dice for her or of the other gorgeous actress that appeared here Stacey Nelkin who is supposed to be a teen but was actually 20 when she made this. Seeing her in a bra and panty and later in a belly dancer outfit was just as arousing as Ms. Bach. They provide some of the scattered laughs this movie provides. In fact, I do not blame Ron Leibman for having his name removed from the credits since his role as the tightfisted Liceman is pretty embarrassing though I did like the seduction scene he did with Ms. Nelkin. This also happens to be the debut of Ralph Macchio who is the loner among the misfits sent to an academy school. The others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother and Ms. Bach, an Arab who worships motor oil, and a politicians son who loves his girlfriend Candy Nelkins character so much, he risks sneaking in the middle of the night see her in the girls academy. Among the supporting cast, Tom Poston plays a swishy character named Sisson who I found partly amusing. With a screenplay by Tom Patchett and Jay Tarses and direction by Robert Downey Sr. whose son Robert Downey Jr. has a cameo early on in a soccer scene, Up the Academy is uneven with the politically incorrect humor but unless you are really offended at the scatological and sexual content, this is actually a pretty harmless comedy that Mad Magazine and its trademark cover boyAlfred E. Newmanshould not be ashamed of even though they once had their name and character taken off the picture...P.S.

The idea of a bomb on a train sounds good...but it turns out this train ends up parked for the majority of the film! No action, no movement, just a static train. The area where the train is parked is evacuated, so it is not like there is any danger to anyone either. In fact, this film could be used in a film class to show how NOT to make a suspense film. True suspense is generated by letting the audience know things that the characters do not, a fact apparently unknown to the director. SPOILER the train actually has two bombs on it, but we are led to believe there is only one. After the first bomb is defused, it feels as if there is no longer a reason to watch the film any more. But at the last minute, the villain, who has no apparent motivation for his actions, reveals there are two. Nor are we certain WHEN the bombs will go off, so we do not even have a classic ticking bomb tension sequence. A good 10 minutes or more are spent watching Glenn Fords French wife thinking about leaving him, and then wondering where he is . She is such an annoying character that we do not care whether she reconciles with him, so when she does, there is nothing emotional about it.

Instead, the story meanders as much as the maps in the film are meant to guide, but never do. At most, we get lost.

The storytelling is sloppy and the directors intent on humanizing a group of people who they regard as overlooked and invisible comes across as unconsciously and irritatingly condescending. The problem here here lies in the perspective of the directors instead of the truck drivers. The directors bring their own naive assumptions about truckers forward and then simply edit the film to confirm those assumptions. Overall, the story lacks any tension, the film is entirely too long should have been a 15 min sketch, the big question of So what is never answered, and the entire film is one piece of seethrough propaganda that does nothing to further enlighten as the directors claim the outside world about big riggers.","label":0},{"index":6604,"txt":"I have watched this movie a few times and never really thought it was that funny, but it is still fun to watch and good for a few laughs.Its about women that work at a company and their boss is a jerk and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine, and try to get the respect they deserve.The acting is really good.

How anyone could cheer for these guys in the audience at the Kids Choice Awards, i have no clue. days before the movie premiere on Nick, most of the teen girl actresses on Nick Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc. showed up in a commercial influencing braindead kids about how awesome nat and alex wolff are. first off, they didn;t trick me, and second of all, nat and alex probably either drugged them or payed them loads of money in order to say that and sound convincing, because i do not see how anyone could find this showmovie entertaining. the music is just awful. nats singing sounds like a sick, dying moose on crack. alex is the most annoying movieTV show character EVER. he is not funny, he is annoying, he is really weird, and he thinks he is hot and knows everything about girls. this guys lucky if he ever manages to get laid. you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters in real life do not even exist!! the character Jesse is actually played by Nat and Alexs cousin jesse Draper they mustve had some budget problem. Their father is not single, he is married to Polly Draper, but she does not appear on the show, making it seem the Wolffs are momless. Rosalina does not exist either. Her name is Allie DiMeco. I will tell ya, the Naked Brothers are gonna be in some deep sh when their fans find out the whole thing is staged. 010","label":0},{"index":6614,"txt":"Show me your boobies! is not funny, and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons if you understand where I am coming from.

The first time I heard of this bad show was when one of my friends was yelling like an idiot JOHNY TEST while we were playing video games. I thought he was confusing Johny Quest by the way, one of the best cartoons I have ever seen in my life, and changing the Quest with Test. Its something weird that I am wrong, but actually I was wrong, he was not changing nothing, he heard of this show.One day, while watching TV, I heard that Cartoon Network was going to be released. I was not sure of what was the plot of this show, so I adventured myself to watch it, and here is my answer I WANT MY DAMN HOUR BACK Because I watched this crap and My Gym Partners a Monkey.This is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. First, the beginning, with the most stupid song in the world, then the plot. Oh, where are my manners? I have not said the plot of this show. Is about a boy who has to AMAZINGLY INTELLIGENT sisters, that have a lab and make experiments with their own brother. OHHH, now I see why his name is Johny TEST, he is the test of his sisters experiments.You know, I honestly miss Dexters Lab before it was transformed to the NEW Dexter, a total crap too. This is a bad copy of that old good show, except that this show is amazingly bad. Do not watch it, make something more productive in that halfhour than watch this crap.","label":0},{"index":6620,"txt":"Cartoon Network seems to be desperate for ratings. Beginning with the cancellation of Samurai Jack, the network seemed hellbent on removing all the shows that made it so popular, such as the Powerpuff Girls, Dexters Lab, Dragonball Z, etc. When the ratings started to plummet, CN began putting up some pretty mediocre shows. Though Total Drama IslandAction and Chowder stand out because of their clever writing and audiencepleasing gimmicks, there are plenty of other shows that either terrible remakes George of the Jungle or rip offs of other shows, such as The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack, where the title character acts just like Spongebob, and then there is Johnny Test, which is something of a replacement for Dexters Laboratory, though it is much more of a sheer rip off than anything.The show is characters are clearly derived from Dexters Lab, only this time the focus is on Johnny, a blonde or fieryhaired character who torments his twin sisters, Susan and Mary, who just HAPPEN to look just like Dexter, from the orange hair, to the glasses, the impossible technology. There is even a rival genius named Bling Bling Boy or Eugene, who appears to be sitting in for Mandark. Then there is Dookie, Johnnys best friend and talking dog, one of Dexters...I mean, Susan and Marys early experiments.Dexters Laboratory was probably one of the best cartoons on television, with its simple, but effective art style, lovable main character, and episodes that do not seem to be a long drag. Johnny Test is a lot different. The art style here is not nearly as eyepleasing. In fact, it looks absolutely awful. The characters have motivations that make them really annoying or repulsive. Like how most of the series episodes consist Johnny and Dookies quest for havoc on the neighborhood girl Sissy, whom Johnny secretly likes, or the twins obsession over a boy next door. Seeing these two geniuses swoon at the sight of abs and the fact that Johnny appears to be someone you would NEVER want to associate with, there is no real connection between the viewer and characters.One thing the series heavily exploits in its name is that Johnny is Susan and Marys guinea pig for their experiments. These range from turning Johnny fat, ugly, monstrous, and even into a woman. The twins then help Johnny in whatever scheme he is planning in return for his services. Whenever there is an episode involving this kind of winwin deal, it usually comes undone at the seems and those that does not come completely off the rails never ends satisfyingly.The writing ranges from mediocre to horrid, however. The fat episode constantly repeats It is Phat with a PH. There is a difference, you know. which is a line that should never be repeated, especially when the episode seems to PROMOTE child obesity, with Johnny becoming a famous star with money and videogames just by becoming fat.Let us talk about how the show does not completely rip off Dexters Lab. The show tosses in a lot of characters, from two MeninBlack named Mr. Black and Mr. White, a military general who seems to need all his problems solved through Johnny and his sisters, and LOTS of super villains, though even here, the show again steals ideas for other sources, like a Mr. Freeze teenage clone, an evil cat with a butler who wants cats to rule over man like the evil talking cat from Powerpuff Girls, a bumbling maniac mastermind, a trio of evil skater dudes and even a Mole Man, which is probably the most clich\u00e9 villain in the media.To top it all off, alongside its ugly animation and unlikeable characters, the voice acting is either passable like the voices for Mr. Black and Mr. White to just plain earsplitting Johnny, Dookie, and just about every villain in the show. The theme song seems to be the only catchy thing to this show, but then it was redone just a few episodes with a band that just ruined it.So in the end, Johnny Test is not a good cartoon. Its horrible references and jokes about teen culture will dismantle little childrens interest in the show, while its bright coloring, rippedoff characters, and dragging episodes will ruin the experience for teens. It is just another one of those crappy shows that Cartoon Network is overpromoting to trick people to watching it like MTV toward rap. If you need a show that will satisfy your children for a half hour, you would better stick to Spongebob, because Johnny Test is more of a test of patience than anything else.","label":0},{"index":6621,"txt":"I used to LOVE this movie as a kid but, seeing it again 20 years later, it actually sucks.

Now I think I know what people are going to say,  How do you know how bad it is? Have you ever watched it?, I did watch this show a couple times because I am studying film and animation and this just does not hold a candle to my standards.I want to first talk about the animation because it is one of the most confusing things I have ever seen. Like the first two seasons or only first season had hand drawn animation. I thought it was a nice show to look at when it was hand drawn but then it switched to flash animation and the quality went down by a huge amount.So that is one strike in my eyes but lets look at the story of the show. It tries way too hard to be like Dexters lab but there are differences because instead of one red headed scientist there is two and they are both female. There is a talking dogwhy?, and the parents attitudes are switched somewhat. I have others but I do not think I can write them here  I do not mean cursing but I mean I do not know if there is a limit for words.. Everything else though is spot on, even a DeeDee character Johnny himself. It just tries so hard to be Dexter but it just seems to me like a heartless knockoff.Lastly I want to talk about the jokes. Remember in Dexters lab some of the jokes involved yelling? Yes, yelling can be good for a joke or two but Dexters lab also had sly remarks that made me have to go back and check to get the joke. Johnny Test just forgets all that and just yells 50 of the time and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or one liner appears. That is not comedy, thats stupid comedy I know what some people are thinking. Is not three stooges stupid comedy? Watch that and Johnny Test back to back and you laugh more at the first option.. Sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations which, like Chowder, makes me mad. I have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together To much bizarre does not equal comedy, it makes you just think what am I watching?.So it strikes out on all accounts. Do not watch this show if you have any respect for comedy in anyway, shape, or form.","label":0},{"index":6626,"txt":"I want so badly to give this piece of GARBAGE a zero, unfortunately, there is not, so, I had to give it a 1 just to warn you about how stupidly terrible this imposter of a familiar cartoon really is!

The writing is incredibly predictable, and the running gags are not much gags at all. Kids will love it, and that is about it.Now, this is not to say that it is all bad. The original opening theme was actually pretty catchy, but for some reason they took the skeleton of it and figuratively smashed it with a figurative aluminum bat. It is a shame, because that was really one of the best things it had going for it.Some of the characters could be very interesting, in theory. With a little work, the characters could work well together, but they are too onedimensional. Then again, this makes it easy for the kids to follow. The pace is a bit too fast as well. The episodes are too busy, leaving little time for clever writing. This is a real shame, because there are so many interesting concepts that the show brings forth. On the upside, however, the fast pace will stop the kids from losing interest, and that is really the entirety of the target audience.Overall, the show looks very good on paper, but just does not succeed in being funny or interesting.

For instance, they mentioned that the diaspora Croats the so called Ustase played a huge part in the fall of Yugoslavia, but they did not mention that there were equal Serbian organizations as well Cetniks! For you who are not that familiar with Balkan WW2 history The Serbian so called Cetniks that were portrayed in the documentary as being so kind that they helped British paratroops during the war. Well, that is only half the truth. They were also a fascist Monarch group who collaborated with the Germans, but then switched side when Hitler started losing the war. It is also ironic that they do not mention the Cetnik leader Mihajlovic in the documentary, a man that is responsible for killing thousands of people and burning hundreds of villages all over Bosnia and Croatia. But they mentioned a certain Ante Pavelic...Hm...Allow me to be just a little suspicious.2 Most of the people interviewed are to me totally unknown. And I have studied this war for a long time who is the old British lady!!! She really has not made her homework! and they are not even presented by name, so they could More or less be anybody, maybe someone they took from the street. Who knows.3 In The documentary they talk about Kosovo and how the Serbs have lived there for ages, and therefore it should belong to Serbia even though they are a minority. Well, when they mention the Serbian dominated part of Croatia Krajina suddenly the Serbs are portrayed as how they have the right to live there because it has been their home for so long. Fine, but what people do not know is that the largest city in Krajina Knin has great historical importance for the Croatian people. It was there where one of the most celebrated Kings of Croatian history Zvonimir was crowned, and therefore the city has a historical value for Croatia. The Serbs arrived almost 800 years or so later! But no, the Serbs should have Krajina and Kosovo according to the documentary. Is that fair? To me it looks like double standards of morality from the director. Plus, it is said in the documentary that the Croatian constitution did not have any laws about minority rights, this is a lie because it was one of the first laws implemented BECAUSE of the fact that Croatia had a huge Serbian minority.4 The film mentions a radical Croatian Paramilitarian leader called Glavas. Or the Muslim radical Oric. They accused them of being a huge reason for the negative development of the war. Yes, they were radicals, but if you want to talk about radicals, why not also mention the Serbian radical paramilitary leaders such as Seselj and Arkan? The flaws are so many that I just presented a few of them, just so that people get an overview of the documentary. It looks like the people who made this documentary were not well prepared and did not have the guts to criticize the Serbs because they were afraid that their Serbian relatives would slap them or something. There are not that many documentaries out there that are of good quality, but the best so far is The death of Yugoslavia where all the significant participants of the war are interviewed e.g. Milosevic, Jovic, Bulatovic, Tudman, Izetbegovic, Karadzic etc. and where you get a whole 5 hour explanation about the fall of Yugoslavia and the war.One other thing. I saw a comment on this documentary where the person was frustrated about why the US gave support to a country Bosnia that had connections with Bin Laden during the war. Well, first of all, all the countries involved in this conflict had nationalist presidents and because the Bosnian Muslims did not have an old ethnic identity previosly they were called Muslim Croats they had to rely on something else besides nationality to raise the spirit among the people, and that was by connecting them to the only thing that they had in common Their religion. And they took help from the Mujahedin because no one else would support them. They had to fight the 4th largest army in Europe! They needed all the help they could get.

The only real improvement which could be made to this amazing achievement would be the inclusion of later developments in the Balkans since the program was made.

Some guy only read a book written by some radical Serbian, the other one is genocide denier etc.etc.Even Slovenians were accused in this movie.And the whole war in Slovenia lasted for few days, and only because Slovenians were lucky.There were not many Serbs in Slovenia, and YNA could not reach Slovenia trough Croatia after CroatiaSerbia war started. Every Slovenian is outraged by all accusations in this movie. Every reasonable Croat will agree with one thing The independence was too early. Perhaps all major conflicts could be avoided. However, mentioning WWII and some unrelated things was truly pathetic attempt to justify everything. Just imagine Japanese throwing nuclear bombs at Seattle and Washington, and saying that was justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will find no evidence about strangled YNA soldier, and murdered Serbian civilians near Vukovar. But you can find the tape with reporter committing that his claims about Serbian civilians near Vukovar were lies. All over the internet. And the director forgot to mention the whole bombing of Vukovar by YNA now on Serbian and Montenegro sideand 100 full of Serbs and Montenegrin And let us not start about the Chetnik movement. At the beginning, it was simply a resistance movement. But director somehow forgot to mention collaboration with the Nazis, including Ustashe, ethnic cleansing, and fighting again the Yugoslav partisans. There are thousands of other things, but all of it can be easily checked. There are many misleading things in this movie. Only few of all accusations are true. Every Croatian is outraged by this movie. I believe that I do not need to mention Srebrenica genocide denial, the genocide that has too many evidence. Imagine the movie about holocaust denial. This movie is the same. And according to this movie Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo bombed themselves. Every Bosnian Muslim is outraged by this movie. Somehow director forgot to mention the short occupation of small piece of Macedonian FYROM land by the Serbs. Croatians, Slovenians, Bosnians, and Macedonians never entered Serbian borders. If you are not Serbian and you actually started to believe some things from this movie, know that Serbs have some kind of propaganda that Croats, Bosnian Muslims, and Macedonians are actually Serbs who made up their history.

John Liviens suicida mothers hero was John Lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on John Lennons musical brilliance, and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life, it showed Lennons legacy to be that of a confused, drug addicted soul, who should looked upon as a God instead a man. I am a huge John Lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another crazy person obsessed with Lennon, Lennons killer , Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we need to be reminded of that? John Lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and I was repulsed to see another disturbed person, as the main character in this movie obsessed by Lennon, and not show his beautiful contributions to the world. Yoko Ono graciously honored John Lennons memory,by making the memorial in Central Park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects, and remember John. Instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide. I found this so disturbing and disrespectful to Lennons memory. He was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death, and to see such violence near this site felt like a revisiting a terrible wound for any Lennon fan. It ruined the movie completely for me . It could have been a decent movie, but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon, and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder by this irresponsible movie.","label":0},{"index":6639,"txt":"Yet another film about a tortured selfcentered, arrogant, unfeeling hateful, selfdestructive lead character we are supposed to care about.Do not get me wrong I am very open to all kinds of off the wall movies that have as the lead character a strongly selfdestructive character. What I object to about this one is that there is so little background to this guy. Why did this guy hate himself and the world? Had the script dealt with this more they might have managed to elicit some sympathy for him. As it is he just comes off as an unpleasant hateful character, not tragic, just hateful.After taking great pains to make this guy as crazy and antisocial as possible and making his fate as dark as possible the writer then has the nerve to make a happy ending....This is not the worst film I have ever seen but it is in there putting up a good fight!

In contrast to other reviewers, I found that the main fault with it is its inability to draw in the viewers interest in the characters and the plot. I sat through it because I am interested in rocknroll and the dynamics of bands, but if I were to evaluate it purely on the basis of its merit as a movie, I would have to give it the thumbs down, with a few caveats Jason Behr is good in the part of John Livien, and quite convincing as a rock singer; the narrative regarding his childhood trauma is unclear, although we are given hints in Liviens wellacted relationship to his parents, but his behaviour is ultimately bizarre to the viewer which it should not be. Nevertheless the idea of using a stage persona to solve inner conflicts is interesting, albeit not novel nor fully explored as a theme in this film. The allusions to John Lennon were irritating, but I confess I am not a Beatles fan. At any rate, Livien and his band reminded me more of Oasis than the Beatles, in the sense that there was something derivative about them. Another frustrating thing about the movie was the way it opened up with some interesting  albeit middlebrow and highschool level  philosophical musings of the lead character, but left the threads of his thinking there, only to pick them up again in the middle of the film very briefly, when Livien says, before God, there was music ever seen that ad for Tia Maria in the 1990s, Before time, there was Tia Maria? That is what sprung to mind anyway; it seems an idiotic conclusion, and the viewer has no idea how he reached it, but he is entitled to it. Fortunately his bassist and friend, played ably by Dominic Monaghan, seems to acknowledge the fallacy of this thinking when he responds You do not know that.In all, the limited strengths of the direction and the plot could go either way on future projects, into pointless banality or into an interesting and more mature perspective.","label":0},{"index":6641,"txt":"This is easily the worst Presley vehicle ever, which would bring us pretty close to the worst film ever made. It is measurably worse than even the revolting Happy Ending song at the end of It Happened At The Worlds Fair, and here I thought that moment when Elvis buys all of the vendors balloons for his girl, and then the balloon vendor gets jiggy to the marching band was the epitome of bad cinema and could not be topped. I usually enjoy the random Elvis flick if for no other reason but the memories of a time when we were innocent enough to sit through it. This one, however, ought to be called Live a Little, Wish You Were Dead a Little, and makes Stay Away Joe look like Olivier playing Othello.Here, Elvis plays Greg, who is essentially a hippie freelance photographer except for the Establishment haircut. After a fun morning of reckless driving, he ends up at the beach where he is abducted by a woman who is name changes depending on the scene and who is speaking to her. Clearly Michele Carey was selected for her resemblance to and ability to mimic Elizabeth Taylor if I watched this without my glasses, I would have thought it was late 1960s Liz playing the female lead. She sics her dog on Elvis until he runs into the water and catches convenient movie pneumonia, then she keeps him doped up out of consciousness in her beach pad so long he loses his job and his apartment so she moves his stuff into her house before he awakens without even telling him the audience does not know about it either, until Elvis tries to go back to work and his boss has him beaten up for no reason except he deserved it for making this movie, and tries to go home and finds some hateful woman in a slip living in his house.Rather than having her arrested for kidnapping, larceny and assault, he goes out and gets two jobs to repay the back rent Miss Crazy Pants had to spring for when stealing all of his belongings. Job one is working for Don Porter at a Playboy type magazine, job two is upstairs working for Rudy Vallee at a snobby fashion magazine. I think the twojob shuffling is supposed to be the comedy, too bad it is not the least bit funny, unless you would laugh the 100th time you saw someone run up and down stairs in fastmotion to silly music. The predominate obstacle that keeps Greg from falling for his abductor is her other love interest, the dreadfully miscast Dick Sargent let us face it, either Porter or Vallee, even given their advanced ages in 1968, would have made far more believable competitors for Miss Crazys affections.There are a variety of uninteresting and unfunny twists and turns, I kept waiting for something, anything to happen that would make all of this make sense. It never did. Entertainment totals approximately three minutes and is comprised of Elvis rendition of A Little Less Talk which I can listen to on CD without this painful movie inflicted upon me and a funny five second bit where Elvis flops on the couch and Crazy Pants has apparently disassembled it so it flies all to pieces when he lands on it. That is it, folks, busted furniture, the only laugh in this entire film. No amount of mod sixties clothing, music, or d\u00e9cor can salvage this highheaven stinker and it should be avoided at all costs. Viewing this can create an unnatural desire on the part of the audience toward the selfinfliction of grave bodily harm.","label":0},{"index":6642,"txt":"LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE is one of Elvis weirdest movies.

Not much music in this one, but what there is I liked, although none are memorable. Strange continuity.

Another good selection would be Caddyshack, the classic with the late Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray before he became annoyingly charming, with great lines like greens keeper Carl Spacklers Correct me if I am wrong Sandy, but if I kill all the golfers they will lock me up and throw away the key.","label":0},{"index":6644,"txt":"When I was seventeen I genuinely believed Elvis to be the king of rock and roll, and not only did I wish to see all 31 of his character movies, but it was my ambition to own them, too. What an exceptionally poor excuse for a seventeenyearold I must have been. Thankfully sense prevailed and Live A Little, Love A Little is the only Elvis film I own.The spotlight has fallen on this one recently since a remixed version of top song A Little Less Conversation has been released as a single. His first to reach the UK top ten in 22 years \u0096 his first UK No.1 in 25 Even when I was seventeen and in serious need of psychiatric help I realised that the songs for this movie were not exactly first rate. However, A Little Less Conversation  rollnecks and 60s grooving aside  is a real standout. Finding a lesserknown song that only a relatively small few are aware of promoted into the mainstream produces a mixture of emotions. It is nice to finally see faith in a song vindicated, but it is also saddening to see the disintegration of your own private cult. And what chauvinistic lyrics, too. Though what other Elvis song contains the word procrastinate?But what really bothers me about this film is not A Little Less Conversation but the 84 minutes that surround it. Actually based on a novel Kiss My Firm But Pliant Lips  what kind of lame novel would that be? this one sees a bored Elvis holed up with a comedy dog and a nympho. Within 90 seconds of meeting him, Michele Carey asks would you like to make love to me? Quite a fast mover by any standards I am sure you will agree.I do seem to recall that some of Elviss early movies  most notably Jailhouse Rock and King Creole  were not too bad, but this is just identikit hillbilly cobblers. Being fired from a newspaper job can lead to a five minute karate fight with a couple of gingernuts, causing a motorway pile up is good for a laugh, and models dress as pink mermaids. There is even a dream sequence for Gods sake. Maybe the only dumb stereotype it does not conform to is in not having all that many songs. With just four to choose from, including the credits number, you are waiting an average of 22 minutes between tracks. Some movies would become vapid by having too many tunes, but here they might have helped to have numbed the pain. Of the remaining three tracks, then The Edge of Reality is not actually that bad, though Elviss dance to it must surely have been called The Bear Trap.In one sense, for a PG certificate film from 1968 then this is shockingly high on sexual content. Sadly, however, with talking dogs, Middle America sitcom values and the stiffest dancing you will ever see, Elviss dignity is obliterated by this movie.","label":0},{"index":6645,"txt":"A halfhearted attempt to bring Elvis Presley into the modern day, but despite a sexy little shower scene and a pseudoPlayboy magazine subplot, Presley is surrounded by the same old coy, winking clich\u00e9s.

So why bother? Because again I find myself watching a lowrated movie that was fun to watch. I did not expect I would to be able to stay in the room while it was on.It was not great, but at least it was not unbearable... not a comedy of errors which always makes me cringe. It was just sweet fluff... and if you cannot take it, stay in the locker room boys. I agree with those who defend this movie because it is sure to please its targeted demographic, and will not be a total bore to an adult.It offers a few good chuckles here and there, but nary a side splitter. Sure it is silly and only mildly entertaining, but at least it does not suck as so many have said it does. Maybe those folks are afraid of their sensitive sides? I have a tendency to grade on the bell curve, so a 4,5 or 6 is actually an okay allaround rating in my book. Giving it a 4 makes sense and will bolster its rating at the time of this writing. Giving it a 1 or a 10, as most have done thus far, makes the rating numbers meaningless. I cannot believe how strongly people feel one way or the other about this forgettable fluff or that I am even bothering to write about it. Am I missing something? Anyway, it should be noted that Emma Roberts performs her role as Clairedycat quite convincingly. Ariell Kebbel often written into bch roles does not disappoint when her character gets her due.

Somehow, everyone knows him, and every single chick in the movie wants him. UH OH! Here comes the competition! The stereotypical hot chick and her best friends, who drive an ugly pink car. We soon find out Jojos mom got the job of a lifetime in Australia, which means that Jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind oh no, I think I am gonna cry.

Yet it more than entertained for what it was, and I cannot deny I enjoyed it immensely.Azumi 2 lacks just about everything that made the original so wonderful. The first thing that should set alarm bells ringing is the absence of the superb Ryuhei Kitamura at the helm. With him, he seemed to take not only his own visual flair and kinetics, but the originals style, beauty and most importantly, its heart. While the first had a simple hitlist plot, this one has a corkscrew mess of a story, with too many dull characters stabbing each other in the back so many times the potential for any sympathy or pathos is obliterated. Gone is the effective interplay between the lead characters; Azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a bunch of stroppy teenagers arguing in a forest. Characterisation is non existent; if anyone watching actually cares who lives and who dies, I will be shocked. The same applies to the villains here. The final battle  in fact all the battles  are completely devoid of any sort of tension. The fact that they are poorly choreographed and abysmally directed  not to mention few and far between  is made a sideline by their own sheer pointlessness. The villains themselves try far too hard to be campy, and even if they were all combined, they do not come within a country mile of the Pete Burnsian antics of Jo Odagiri in the original.Major Spoiler at end of paragraph! Aya Ueto tries her best it has to be said, and she also managed to keep her hair in good condition between the films. Azumi is now a fully fledged assassin, meaning she can wave her sword around in slow motion; unfortunately, now the character is instilled with a sort of Man With No Name style mysteriousness, Uetos model looks become even more inappropriate. I know this is supposed to be the point, but this combined with the ineffectiveness of everyone else in the film, the stupidity of the plot and the general ineptness of the film in general means it is downright impossible to get behind her character this time around. The less said about Chiaki Remember me from Kill Bill Kuriyamas performance the better; it suffices to say her turn from good to evil is about as subtle as napalm.Overall, this was just a colossal disappointment. Any merits is does have were done ten times better in the first film.

I watched Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating. I amazed myself being able to sit through it. Lets talk about the plus points of the movie. The girl. Ueto Aya is cute. Thats all there is to salvage the whole movie. The fact is, if the main character was male, i am sure that most people including me would not have touched the movie at all. Now lets talk about the minus points. Firstly, it is real draggy, with lots and lots of repeated scenes. Scenes of Nachi and Azumi keeps coming back. It seems more like a drama way of shooting. Typical Japanese dramas love flashbacks, and this movie too. Secondly, the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting. I do not mind unrealistic movies. But this movie is like a poor way of showing creativeness, by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and spider webs, etc... it reminds me of Shinobi, though Shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting. Moreover, to portray ido notknow what effect, the director films people dying with blood spraying literally all around... people not realizing their head was cut off... etc.. etc... etc... Too many of these spoils the show. It seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie. It degrades the show greatly. Thirdly, Is not Azumi supposed to be an assassin. She seems more like an onemanarmy to me, just that she is a female. I do not think you see assassins charging into army camps. The only time i felt she acted assassinliked was when she killed the Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Lastly, the plot was thin in both movies. Its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way.","label":0},{"index":6651,"txt":"I loved the first Azumi movie. I have seen Ms. Ueto in a variety of her TV appearances and I have seen my fair share of samurai and ninja flicks. I have to say that this movie was much weaker than I would expected.Given the movies cast and set up in Azumi, they should have been able to do a much better job with this movie, but instead it was slow, plodding in parts, and sprinkled with very poor, unconvincing, and wooden acting.When they bothered to reference the first movie, they did so in a manner that was pretty loose and weak. In Azumi, the title character is the best of a group of superior killers. In Azumi 2 she seems somehow diminished and lessimpressive.That is not to say it was a total loss. There were a few decent fight scenes and some overthetop characters. Unfortunately, the movie suffers overall from the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama.

So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off, however these are completely 2 different movies. The pace is a lot slower, the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development. This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO monster franchise if that is possible!. I agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity. If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this installment. There is however some beautiful Japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off. Even the real bad guys, get killed off too easily without too much of a fight. The fight with the Spider guy straight out of an episode of Monkey! in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene. Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects, Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cape cam!! Azumis rampage at the end was unconvincing, but Aya still does an okay job.

In Azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics which is their number one priority as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape. But I will not hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in Azumis way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma. By the way, Chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of Go Go, minus the cool weapon and sense of menace.This brings me to the final blow which is the action, simply disguised in the title as the Death side of the epic. In the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons. To no ones surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily. In Azumi 1, the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between Azumi and Bijomaru in comparison to the fights in Azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile. Some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter. I am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both Azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched.The romance side of Azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution.As a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation, I will not lie and I will admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first Azumi film, but I will step right up and say that after watching Azumi 2, the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece. For what it is worth, Azumi 2 Death or Love could have gone straight to video, with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins, doing their best to restore the peace, with an unwavering courage to die trying.","label":0},{"index":6654,"txt":"That is what my friend Brian said about this movie after about an hour of it.

Plus all the actors do their best to act like it got really chilly for some reason.2. Barbara Bachs criminally awful accent. She sounds like she is trying to talk like a baby while rolling a marble around on her tongue. There is no nudity, and there are several scenes where the boys all moan and writhe from a glimpse of her cleavage, like they are in a community school acting class and they have been directed to act like aroused retarded people. 3. Liceman feeds his revolting dog a condom. Remember; when this movie came out throwing in abortion and condom was seen as edgy. 4. Tom Poston plays a mincing, boyhungry pedophile, back when Hollywood thought pedophile and homosexual were one in the same. Flatout embarrassing. 5. Watch the ending. Nothing is wrong with your VCR. That is actually the ending. Tell me that does not make you want to explode everyone who is ever made any movie, ever. Watch this at your own risk.

Another stereotype, maybe, but a fairly true one. Because that is how Chinese parents work. That is how Chinese values work. If they wanted to go for authenticity, they would have made Wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a lovehate relationship with her family.This just adds to my frustration with American movies. Asian culture is not about meditation and vague, natureoriented phrases that sound wise. We do not walk around smiling enigmatically all the time, and we do not all know some form of martial arts.

The whole Chineseness is awakened in your being because of the ancestors was a hard sell. But telling the audience that every Chinese knows Chinese history without even studying it just laughable. That is like saying every American knows American history without studying or every Filipino, etc, etc. It just is not believable.The story is flat out hideous. It talked about Shin being from a Monastery in China  later identifying it from Bejing. However, the early sequences of the film show the map focusing in on Mongolia. I know the current Chinese regime wants to claim areas like Mongolia for its own, granted. But its a distinct nation and it even labels Mongolia on the map. Did Disney Studios fail 5th Grade Geography? The relationship between Wendy and Shin is superficial at best, and yet she somehow feels connected to him. Her training is just cheesy as well. And, lets cut to the chase everything about this film is bad. Its bad enough to laugh at and cry over. The Taekwondo action was over played and unrealistic in many instances.The evil eyes thing was cheesy. However, the left out ending would have been the only descent thing about it. They should have left the evil eyes ending in it. But instead somehow evil is defeated. Yey! Overall,not worth the time of the dog in the film. Brenda Song should get on with another studio. F","label":0},{"index":6661,"txt":"There are several things wrong with this movie Brenda Songs character being one of them. I do not believe that the girl is a lousy actor I honestly do not. I believe she is given poor lines. She is just supposed to be, that vain, rich girl, and while it is funny in the TV shows she plays in, it cannot even get a dry laugh from me here.Either way, I really should have known what to expect when I sat down to watch this film.The movie was not that terrible...initially. Wendys reaction to Shen was completely natural. I mean, how would you feel if a man, claiming to be a reincarnated monk, chased you around commanding you to wear a medallion and insisting that you were needed to fight the great evil and save the world? Which brings me to another point. I know this movie is entirely fiction, but it is still has a founding in Chinese culture. It seems like all of the warriors in Wendys family line were women. Correct me if I am wrong, but I doubt that the monks would have just been okay with that. Sure, maybe they could have worked it in somehow, but they offered no explanation whatsoever. By doing so, they just contributed to the many cheesy attempts at female empowerment made by Hollywood and the media.Nevermind that, however let us continue.Wendys character becomes more unbearable as the film go on. Yes, she is a teenager, and it is near homecoming I mean, who wants to fight evil during homecoming? The problem is, when the evil starts to manifest himself, Wendy does not seem as freaked out as she should be. She is extremely careless even for someone like her. She continues not to care about her training. I will use this conversation as an example, Shen If you do not win this battle, evil will take over, and everything good will be gone. Wendy Whoa, talk about pressure. Well...let us talk about something else. Yes, let us Wendy. Let us also go dancing when you should rightfully be training. Of course Shen lets her, but his character has an excuse. Better that he cooperate with her, than that he not, and she not train at all, and get them both killed.Oh, speaking of which. Shen also told Wendy that it was his destiny for him to die for her in battle, as he had for her greatgrandmother I am assuming that part.This makes Wendys actions more unforgivable.As the scriptwriter would have it, Wendys homecoming and this great battle are on exactly the same day. Do you know what Wendy does? Do you even have to guess? Yes, she does end up going to the battle, for when she tries to leave for homecoming, the monks, who Shen had trapped in the body of her coach and teachers because she felt weird fighting an old man inform her that Shen has gone to battle alone, so she goes to save him.We initially see some halfdecent fighting, that is actually entertaining. Until finally, the great evil comes out of Wendys rivalforhomecomings body, and creates the actual embodiment of himself out of the broken pieces of the bodies of his ancient warriors.Do not ask.Anyway, Wendy gets all panicky. Then Shen goes and defends her from this guy forgive me for forgetting his long Chinese name and manages to get himself killed.Wendy catches Shen as he makes his long descent from being thrust uncomfortably high into the air.She screams title of said article out.Now...it was bad enough that Wendy became powerful far, far too fast. No, I will not let it be excused because it was her destiny and she had the power within her.Since when, though, did she learn healing? No, worst...since when could she resurrect people? So Shen is raised from the dead. Then, Wendy and he fight the guy.He loses way to easily. The worst part, is when they jump together, and kick him at the same time, and he is banished forever. Then the monks commend Wendy on her sacrifice.Two things, 1 Do not the script writer and director know a battle needs a little more finesse to it? 2 What sacrifice? The fact that she did not go to homecoming? Because the girl did not break a sweat, or even bleed. I mean, come on now, this movie was TV PG, I wanted to see somebody get hurt.Ahhem...moving on.I know it sounds like maybe I should have given the movie a one, based on my comments. Part of critique, you must know, though, is breaking a thing down. You do not necessarily try to look for the bad, but if it is there, you bring attention to it. This movie has a lot of bad, but something funny happens when you never really expect something to be all too great in the first place.So, I suppose it was all right. Not that me not saying it was not all right would have stopped anybody from watching it.","label":0},{"index":6662,"txt":"I thought this movie was terrible. I am Chinese, so I thought everything was totally wrong. Many of the facts were incorrect. The only thing right about Chinese history in the movie was when Wendys mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi. I also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake. Many of the actors and actresses were not very great. Some of the jokes that were supposedly funny were really stupid. I think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get. Disney has really got to get more information about Chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie. Mulan was quite accurate. Watch this movie if you want to waste some time.","label":0},{"index":6663,"txt":"I thought the movie especially the plot needs a lot of work. The elements of the movie remains westernized and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie. I will give three out of many of the flaws of the movieFirst, when Shen told Wendy that he would help her study the history of China, I was really happy that the audience would receive some information about Chinese history; but it turns out that the movie did not exactly show Wendy actually studying Chinese history; yet instead, the movie only shows Wendy practicing the method of remembering what she had studied, which frustrated and put me in dismay.Second, which really bothered me, is how the characters kept mentioning about moon cakes  moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good it tastes. Yet they did not really mention the real significance of it. The only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the Autumn Festival, which they did not explain or go in depth. They could have mentioned the myth that correlates with the moon cake  the Moon Lady. The myth starts of with how there once exists ten suns and each would rotate rising, but one day all ten suns rose up, drying up the land with the rising intense heat; so the Divine Archer, Hou Yi, shot nine of the ten suns, leaving only one sun there are different versions where the Hou Yi shot the eight out of nine suns. Because of his heroic contribution, he was given the pill of immortality so he could live on forever in case the ten suns do rise up again, but his wife, ChangO stole it. After stealing it, she fled to the moon, where she met a hare. She then came upon an idea and told the hare to pound the pill into many piece so she could spread the pill all over earth, giving everyone immortality. There are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood, I, most of the time, heard about this version. I thought details such as this would make the plot more culturally Chinese oriented.The last thing I would point out is the last battle scene of the movie. The teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the Terracotta Warriors the lifelike statues of the soldiers went against the idea of how important Chinese history is to the Chinese. The Terracotta Warrors serves as a connection of Chinas past and it was very westernized where evil must be killed in anyway possible that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection. It would be understandable if Wendy, considering she is ChineseAmerican and does not have full Chinese knowledge, had no problem destroying these priceless artifacts.The whole movie was westernized because it seemed that all the monks and Shen want to do is fight... I mean, it is rated TVPG due to violence, which goes against the Confucius thinking of cooperation and harmony. It would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out peacefully before having to resort to violence.All in all, all of or either of the producer, writer, or director did not do their research thoroughly and did a messy and effortless job instead. I would suggest that they either stop airing this movie or that they reshoot the movie so it contains more accurate information; however, I would give it credit 2 stars for removing one stereotype of Asians and AsianAmericans of being smart and quiet.","label":0},{"index":6664,"txt":"This movie was so poorly written and directed I fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie. The jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles, it is too far fetched and at some points ridiculous. If you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed, but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts which I might add are poorly done and wish you were some warrior to. The casting in this movie was not very good, and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it did not fit at all. On a scale of 110 10 being excellent, 1 being horrible the acting in this movie is a 4. Brenda Song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of movie, in some of the more serious scenes, her acting was laughable. When she made some of her fighting poses, I started laughing out loud. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing, for example, the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing, how her voice turns dark and evil, I think that was incredibly stupid, and how Wendys Brenda Songteachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks, that was pretty ridiculous to. So to sumamrize it all, a disappointing movie, but okay if you are 10 or under.","label":0},{"index":6665,"txt":"I realize that living in the Western Plains of Wyoming during the 1900s was brutal, in fact, it probably is still brutal today, but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly madeforTV movie? Also, womens rights were still budding in this nation during this time, so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory, and still show the realism of the era \u0085 would it make for good viewing? Honestly, I do not know. I have thought about this film for the past two days, and I still cannot seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film, yet I can truthfully tell you that it was not the greatest I have ever seen. From several hodgepodge styles of acting, to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character, to some of the most gruesome PG rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema, it is hard to fully get a good grasp on Heartland. Was it good? Was it bad? That may be up for you to view and decide yourself, but until then, here are moments I enjoyed and desperately hated! This film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes. Scenes where I was not sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed, but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole. I thought the story as a whole was a very interesting, historical tale. I do not know much about living in Wyoming, especially during the early 1900s, so this film captured that image in my mind. The thought of very cold winters, no neighbors for miles upon miles, and this Polaroidesquire view untouched by corporate America. It was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience though the television. There were scenes that really stood out in my mind, like the cattlebranding scene, the pig slaughtering scene, and the saddening homesteader that did not survive their journey, that just brought a true sense of realism to this story. Director Richard Pearce did a great job of bringing the view of Wyoming to the viewers, but I am not sure he brought decent players to accompany the view.While I will constantly compliment the scenery of this film, I had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side. Rip Torn seemed out of place in his role as Clyde Stewart, a loner that somehow finds a connection with Conchata Ferrells Elinore Randall. The two as actors have no chemistry at all. Their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion. The pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two veteran actors portrayed it. The brave Elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her, while Clyde gives an approving nod when she is done. This is love? Was it supposed to be love? I do not know, I think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond, but with Torn and Ferrell, it felt like two actors just playing their parts. Other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse knocks on the door for food or shelter, the constantly fading and growing compassion that Clyde had for Elinores daughter I just did not believe it, the lack of true winter struggle, and the entire land scene. The land scene especially because I needed more explanation on what Elinore was doing, why she was doing it, and why Clyde would build her a house if they were married! It was these simple events that if taken the time to explore, would have made for a stronger film.Overall, I will go middle of the road with this feature. There were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper, such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of Elinore, but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation. These panoramic scenes which, in the span of 100 years, have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers. While there were some brilliant scenes of realism starring cattle and pigs, I just felt as if we needed more. Depth was a key element lacking in this film, which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story. Pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped world, but instead left open loopholes and clich\u00e9d Western characters. Ferrell carried her own, but Torn was completely miscast.

I could see the need to put in western elements in the show, however, there are certain parts, where Chinese elements were needed too! The villain for example. His physical appearance resembled a robot, instead of something out of the Chinese culture. The final and the worst flaw, were the incorrect, and distorted facts placed in the show.Others may point out that this is a Kids show and hence, there is no need for the such high standards. However, there are other Disney shows, such as Mu Lan, which have been much better in terms of story development and presentation.In conclusion, I feel that Disney movies should be better researched and better planned.

The subtle interplay between Oliver and Caine which made the first movie so watchable, is replaced with a horrid, brash arrogance that instantly breeds disdain in the viewer. But this is not the clever, toing and froing of liking one then the other character the original fostered so well, this is an obvious OTT character assassination of both character from the word go.This version of Sleuth is not really worth seeing, watch the original film and be dazzled from the opening act.","label":0},{"index":6673,"txt":"It is a while ago, that I have seen Sleuth 1972 with two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but he is now the husband and Jude Law the lover of his wife. The story is still the same and it is a fantastic play.During the movie I always had the feeling to watch a play. That is one of the reasons I dislike this remake of a classic. When I watch a movie adapted a play I still must feel to see a movie and not just a play. Director Kenneth Brannigan did some marvelous movies in the past, but this time he missed. Another reason was the look of the movie. The design was modern, stylish clean, uncomfortable and cold. I never got the feeling that somebody ever lived in that house. The photography was not bad, but the lightening was awful. Sometimes there was blue light, dark, green light, to round it up not friendly for eyes.The acting was really good. Michael Caines and Jude Laws perform at their best. I really would like to see these 2 guys playing together on stage. But I have to confess I never was a fan of Jude Law. The weakest part was the mid part. I remember that in the original that this part was still very mysterious and just marvelous directed. I tried to watch it twice and always in the mid part I felt asleep. The end part is better and more interesting. Sleuth 2007 is not awful, but it seems to be more a movie for critics than for the audience. Sleuth 1972 is still a masterpiece and much more entertaining than Sleuth 2007.","label":0},{"index":6674,"txt":"Joseph L. Mankiewiczs Sleuth did not need a remake. It is a thoroughly well made film that stands up well to this day. However, given that the modern day remake machine is currently in full swing; I really cannot say I am surprised to see the film updated for modern audience. The plot remains identical to the original film and at its core we have the story of a young man, Milo Tindle, who goes off to see an older man, Andrew Wyke, to discuss a divorce as the younger man is having an affair with the older mans wife. From there, a game of cat and mouse ensues. Its clear right from the outset that director Kenneth Branagh wanted to add a different touch to this film and he does so by way of the central location, which has been changed from the charming gamesridden country house of the original to a technical marvel kitted out with layers of security equipment. I am glad that the director chose to make this change as nobody wants to see a remake that directly copies of the original; plus there is the fact that the location is well used and always nice to look at. Unfortunately, however, the positive elements of Sleuth 2007 end there.The original film was over two hours long, while this remake is only just a shade over eighty minutes. Naturally, therefore, that means that this version has less about it; and unfortunately it is the characters that suffer. The plot is also rushed and we get into the first twist in the tale far too quickly and before we are given any chance to actually understand why and how these events can be taking place. The film does not build the characters, or the rapport between them, enough to make sure that their relationship makes sense. One major thing that has been changed about the older character is his obsession; in the original he was obsessed with games which turned out to be VERY important once the twists come into play. Here he has some kind of security fetish that does not really mean anything by the end. Kenneth Branaghs handling of the film allows for a classy score but the class ends there. The original thrived on it, but this film is happy merely to soil itself with expletives on numerous, and mostly unwarranted, occasions; which cheapen the whole thing. The final twist in the tale is completely different to how it was in the original and ensures that the film boils down to a really hideous conclusion. After spending two hours with the original I understood, respected and liked both characters presented in the film  after eighty minutes of this, I hated them both. I do have some respect for Branagh for not merely rolling out a carbon copy of the original film; but this is not a good adaptation of the great Anthony Shaffer play.","label":0},{"index":6675,"txt":"At the name of Pinter, every knee shall bow  especially after his Nobel Literature Prize acceptance speech which did little more than regurgitate canned, bythenumbers, sixthform antiAmericanism.

The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind. Yes, it was a theatrical confection, and it is easy to see how it is central plot device would work better on the stage than the screen, but it still worked terrifically well. This is a Michael Caine vanity piece, but let us face it, Caine is no Olivier. Not only can he not fill Larrys shoes, he could not even fill his bathroom slippers. The appropriatelynamed Caine is, after all, a distinctly average actor, whose only real recommendation, like so many British actors, is their longevity in the business.

Having recently suffered through it on cable, I still congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter, and starproducer Jude Law deluded themselves that their prestige alone could sustain this travesty through an interminable 93 minutes, without the fun or class of the longer original.Michael Caine enhanced his reputation playing the second lead in the marvelous 1972 film. He now seems intent on destroying it by attempting the lead, played in that version by Laurence Olivier. Both were nominated for Best Actor Oscars, but lost to Marlon Brando in THE GODFATHER. Looking puffy and washedout, Caine glides through the part with less depth than he displays as Batmans butler. He had already lowered himself to a guest appearance in the atrocious remake of GET CARTER. What is next  ALFIE II, or SON OF THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING? But then, no one benefits from this inane adaptation by Pinter, who thinks that frequent cursing and an added sexual angle can compensate for the absence of Shaffers witty character interplay. Branaghs direction relies on bluish lighting and a soulless set design that would not hold up in a secondrate nightclub. Neither the shadows nor the tight, overacted closeups can help Law overcome his dull screen persona. The result is a failure both as straight drama and as detective thriller, almost making you forget the purpose behind the title.Fans of the original stage production with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter and the OlivierCaine film would do well to regard this enterprise as a bad dream.

Here the film is directed by Kenneth Branaugh.The acting is spectacular. Both Caine and Law are gangbusters in their respective roles. I really like the chemistry and the clashing of personalities. It is wonderful and enough of a reason to watch when the scripts direction goes haywire.Harold Pinters dialog is crisp and sharp and often very witty and I understand why he was chosen to rewrite the play which is updated to make use of surveillance cameras and the like.The problem is that how the script moves the characters around is awful. Michale Caine walks Law through his odd modern house with sliding doors and panels for no really good reason. Conversations happen repeatedly in different locations. I know Pinter has done that in his plays, but in this case it becomes tedious. Why do we need to have the pair go over and over and over the fact that Law is sleeping with Caines wife? It would be okay if at some point Law said enough we have done this, but he does not he acts as if each time is the first time. The script also does not move Caine through his manipulation of Law all that well. To begin with he is blindly angry to start so he has no chance to turn around and scare us.Never mind a late in the game revelation that makes you wonder why he bothered In the original we never suspected what was up. here we do and while it gives an edge it also somehow feels false since its so clear we are forced to wonder why Laws Milo does not see he is being set up. There are a few other instances but to say more would give away too much.Thinking about the film in retrospect I think its a film of missed opportunities and missteps. The opportunities squandered are the chance to have better fireworks between Caine and Law. Missteps in that the choice of a garish setting and odd shifts in plot take away from the creation of a tension and a believable thriller.

We see reflections of the actors in stainless steel, on security monitors, shots of their heads from 200 ft above, close ups of eyes, chins, and on and on. The screenplay, by a Nobel Laureate, introduces long stretchs of unpleasant homosexual banter, that is being faked by both parties,.... I think?? Given the character twists how would I know? The characters themselves,so richly drawn in the original, are crass and unsympathetic. The running time has been cut by an hour, which is either the real problem or the kindest thing the Director did for us. The actors perform their lines effectively, but nothing they say or do is remotely believable. Jude Law is over the top more than Caine, but as the credited Producer, must have had Branaghs blessing.All in all I found this to be an ugly to look at, unconvincing shell of a former classic. Why was it even made??? The paying public spent less that 4M worldwide to see it! A vanity piece of work that fails at every turn.","label":0},{"index":6681,"txt":"86 wasted minutes of my life.

And if it is not the wooden acting, almost as though you can see the teleprompter, then the set itself, which is overlit and interfering in utterly unnecessary ways, and overdressed to an unimaginable extent, is enough to put you off the entire farce.As to the supposed shock of a detective under disguise, any person who does not see that  as well as the entire rest of this ludicrous plot  telegraphed light years in advance, should check their eyesight immediately.Bad acting, and from two very decent actors, coupled with the hypercoddled Branagh trademark overdirection, is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourself.On top of it all, there is a completely risible undertone of homoerotica in this, heightened towards the end of it.

Nine dead tries to have heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new.

While it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of Elinore Stewarts children, it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good, enriching, strengthening experiences of homesteading her land. The book details her life on her and her husbands adjoining homesteads in the vast Wyoming frontier; she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances, though they lived dozens of miles apart. The film, however, takes a standard stance for the time it was made, portraying this womans experience as harsh, unforgiving, and nearly pointless. Perhaps the director was bringing some of his Vietnam War experiences with him to this movie as some film aficionados have said, but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak, odious landscape devoid of friends or hope.

Most were offcamera, minimizing the horror that we were supposed to feel by the deaths.It also bugged me that the cop was among the victims; he unwittingly contributed to the innocent young man going to prison by accepting planted evidence given to him by MJH into the evidence room. And would not MJH a the prosecuting attorney, have had access to that evidencetaking it out and putting the wrong evidence backanyway, so she would not have needed the cops help?. The others, while often also not realizing it was this particular person they were harming, still played larger roles in his ultimate demise. The gun dealer should have know his guns would be used for evil intent. The insurance guy rejected a person obviously in need, etc. But the cops crime seemed minor in comparison since he did not know exactly what he was doing. The filmmakers could have taken it a step further and had him be the one that encouraged MJH to plant the evidence, which would have made him more culpable. And MJHs yelling that he the cop got her in that mess does not make any sense at all.It would been more intriguing if each person died in a way that offered the others a clue to why heshe was there and deserved to die.

Berenger and Poitier, rube and city slicker set out to hunt down a dangerous psychopath before he crosses the border to Canada. Some of the attempts at comedy in this film clearly fail and Berenger and Poitiers bonding was cringeworthy and awkward not helped by a completely bland script. Kirstie Alley as the hostage was underused, and almost entirely ignored when she was on screen. Some attempt at suspense is made, for example when you are meant to try and guess which of 5 men on a fishing trip is the murderer all of them are typecast villains. I understand that this is the entire appeal to most fans out there. I guessed who it was and I was not really trying hard.If you are a Berenger fan, watch the Sniper 1993, you even get to see Billy Zane strutting his stuff. It is much better.

Kirstie Alleys character could have been a great one, and even showed some possibilities once, but the writer really let us down by making her role mostly a helpless female. This was completely inconsistent with the strongly independent character she was supposed to be. I do not care for Alleys acting anyway.

Also there is a severe lack of midgets running about.The only good bits are the cracking start and, of course, Reggie B.Possible SPOILER coming UpTo me this film seems like a filler between II and IV as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in IV.Overall very, VERY disappointing. 3  10","label":0},{"index":6713,"txt":"It is been close to ten years since I have seen either of the last two sequels to Phantasm  surely due to my still vivid remembrance of them not being very good. That being acknowledged to this day, I am still a huge fan of the first two installments so I thought I would go back and reexperience the final chapters. Part three is definitely the worst of the series since it obviously takes itself less seriously and throws in a bunch of confusing stuff that does not make much sense... Again, kicking off right where the previous movie left us, Reggie saves Mike from the Tall Man who vows to come back for him later, but things are not safe for long when they come across Jody who is inexplicably able to the take the form of a sphere. Apparently his soul is held prisoner by the Tall Man so Mike is then dragged into the sinister doublepronged Netherworld and Reg has to find him... Along the way, he meets up with a ten yearold kid and a nunchuck wielding black chick named Rocky who assist him throughout his journey.There is really nothing memorable about Phantasm III other than how stupid and forcefully humorous it tries to be. Only one positive aspect that did not even help the movie and that was the return of A. Michael Baldwin and Bill Thornbury who reprise their roles for the first time since the original 1978 classic. The problem is, they pretty much make cameo appearances... Reggie Banister is of course back in his starring role, but his bumbling, lovesick attitude makes his presence far too annoying to like. Angus Scrimm also just did not seem entirely into his role. He talks too much here and is nowhere near as menacing and creepy in contrast with the quirkiness that the movie seemed to carelessly resort to. Most peoples opinion on this flick seem pretty impassive and tend to think it is still entertaining. Maybe I am just too much of a nit picker but I just could not get into this one. I remember disliking it when I was a kid and after rewatching it  I can safely say  nothing has changed. Don Coscarelli rocked the scene with his original lowbudget, nightmarish, legendary film Phantasm, which I still rank as my top favorite horror flick and his respectable sequel kept things moving and darkly surreal and GORY, but Lord of the Dead stupid title just looked too rushed and slapped together to me... The inclusion of the two new characters, Tim and Rocky the only thing missing was Scrappy Doo!!, was a strong indication of Coscarelli running out of ideas and seeing how far he could ride the franchise...So, it is a Phantasm movie with very little gore, nudity, and quadruplebarrel shot guns.

My most favorite appearances by him are in Nightmare On Elm Street 1,3, and 7 as Nancys father a cop, Black Christmas as a cop, and From Dusk Till Dawn again as a cop. When I was rummaging through my local mall video outlet I came across the film Zombie Death House and I quickly tossed it back but before moving on I noticed that John Saxon was not only an actor in this film but for the first time that I have ever heard of a director. This intrigued me Also the cheap 9.00 price tag and I and I had to have it. Upon coming home I realized that this film did not live up to Saxons other work even his acting, which may have been muddled by the added pressures of directing. But it was not just him the other actors sucked too. It seemed as if they had all been pulled out of a recent porno shoot and told now guys you really have to act. The film even looks of 80s porn quality. I cannot in good faith recommend this film to casual viewers, but if you are an obsessed fan of the 80s who missed out on the culture that came from that era by being born to late, or a fan of crap films than this one is for.

The plot takes way too long to get off the ground, never steadies itself, and then just plain crashes about 40 minutes into the film. There are a few gem moments for zombie fans, but not nearly enough zombies to create a real sense of terror.The zombies also take a long time to make their appearance. First, there is a whole half of a movie about mobs and prison gangs. The hero of the movie is an exVietnam vet who gets caught up in the mob. The main mob boss sets him up and he goes to jail. In this jail, they are experimenting on the prisoners to find a way to cure them of homicidal tendencies and criminal behavior. But the badie psychotic head scientistmilitary guy has other plans in mind. He wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to make ....da da da.... super soldiers! After some infected prisoners kill a few guards and most of the prison has a round of infected communion wine, the militarycrazy scientist guy goes hey this might be a problem and gives a call to the genius scientist turned investigative journalist hot babe ultraempowered independent woman character, who of course invented the original serum. She goes to the prison to see what is going down, the military guy calls in a few SWAT teams from his secure position outside the prison, and the hero guy takes charge of the few prisoners with a heart of gold when a riot breaks out. The hero guy and the scientistjournalist lady team up to find a cure, save the wardens kids, and deal with some irate prisoners, both infected and not. Meanwhile, the mob boss guy has made a deal to get into the prison so that he can save his imprisoned brother. The military gets ready to blow the place up, and everyone inside scrambles to find a way out.There are a lot of gory scenes where people are killed by being pressed or pulled through prison bars. There is also a creepy decapitation scene and electrocution scene involving the same infected rasta prisoner. Still, the most disturbing scene is in the early part of the film, when a gross corrupt guard rapes a prisoner.The main highlight of this film is one scene towards the end. The hero, woman, and kids are trying to make their way to the only escape route. Their path leads them to a long hallway, on one side there is a wall and on the other are prison bars. Hundreds of bloody zombie hands reach through, gracing their hair and faces as they pass by. There is also a few good scenes of the classic couple of zombies munching on freshly dead bodies and many zombies ripping one guy to shreds bits.Overall, worth watching if you are researching the zombie genre as it has so many zombie clich\u00e9s worth noting; it is practically an instruction manual on what not to do when making a zombie movie. But if you are new to zombie flicks and want a real scare, you should look elsewhere.","label":0},{"index":6719,"txt":"I myself am a big fan of lowbudget 80s horror films. This is not the worst but still not to spectacular. The plot line is decent but drags out way too long. You are through half the movie before you even get to see any zombie action. The kills are not very creative and the zombies are not too crafty. I truly think this movie would have been better if they left out the zombies and just made it into some mafia flick. It is watchable but I feel that this film did steal at least an hour of my life. I will give the film credit for being somewhat original.

There is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin!! And, as a result, none of it seemed particularly believable.The movie starts with Kay Francis as a housewife living in a small town. She is had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to Broadway. When a bigtime actor arrives in town, she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost. But, her husband is worried about shenanigansas this actor is a cad. So, the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actorand the actor dies! As a result, he is convicted of First Degree Murder!!! Not Manslaughter, but Murder 1! Now, pregnant and in need of funds, Kay goes to New York. But Broadway jobs are not to be found, so she is forced to take any jobeven Burlesque. Unable to adequately care for her young daughter, she gives it to another woman to raise. However, eventually she does find a job in a real Broadway play and everything looks rosy. But, the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play. Despondent, she makes her way to England and becomes a real star. Years later, she returns to New York to get her kidbut the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother. At the same time, her husbands lawyer now thinks that if he gets 10,000 he can get the man out of prison. As another reviewer wrote, is this to bribe people?! How can 10,000 get him out otherwisemaybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up!! Wowthis is enough for 2 or 3 films! And, all this occurs by the 45 minute mark!!! Believe it or not, there is quite a bit more to it. If you really care, see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds.This is sort of like kitchen sink writingthrowing in practically everything and hoping, somehow, it will all work. Unfortunately, the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite Ms. Francis best efforts. It is the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2ndrate plot. It is almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements, threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie!! Overall, unless you are a diehard Kay Francis fan or love anything Hollywood made in the 1930s, this one is one you can easily skip. Not terrible but certainly not good.By the way, the child who plays Francis daughter upon her return to New York Sybil Jason really was terrible. I think she was supposed to be...I think.","label":0},{"index":6721,"txt":"When a man who does not have Alzheimers cannot remember how many films he is made, he probably is the worlds most prolific director after all. That man is Jesus Franco, the king of socalled eurotrash. His 1980 flick Devil Hunter is as rushed, opaque, stupid, lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word the films title is misleading, for starters as any other Franco film I have seen. That makes it sound pretty awful, and it is... Yet Franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility, a generous way with the baldly outrageous, with nudity and sleaze and violence, and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made. The mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out, even while you are mostly waiting for them to end because they are so very tedious.Devil Hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour. The kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in South America. There is lots of naked writhing, dancing, and endless repeated zoomins on an ugly totem pole. You need to get used to the repetitive zoomins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away, as these are Francos main methods of extending a film out to feature length.The monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary. He has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning, apparently recorded in an echo chamber. Early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree, and it is hard to know what really happens here but I think he ate her stomach or her genitals, sweet Jesus!.Anyway, the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out Vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers. The flakey guy has an accent which, as dubbed, is half BrooklynAmerican, half EnglishLiverpudlian and all retarded. All of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable, making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest.Not too much really happens from here on in, and it happens pretty sluggishly, studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape. The nebulous action is fleshed out haha! by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads, and even from the monster himself. That he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero, but it is gotta be done at some point, and it is nice to note that the director will show anyones genitals on camera.The best feature of Devil Hunter is the location filming. Franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of filmmaking, but he does not muck around with sets. You get real islands, jungles, helicopters and mountains, all in widescreen. This is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy CGI sets and backdrops ad nauseam.Ultimately, issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot. If you are trying to see all the Video Nasties, you will have to watch this at some point, and you will be made as restless as I was. If you like Franco, you will watch this anyway. If you fall into neither of the above categories, the odds are you will never come across this film. Copies of it are not just lying around, and I could hardly recommend the seeking out of it. It is Franco. Lazy, crazy Franco.","label":0},{"index":6722,"txt":"If you made a genre flick in the late 80s, you basically had a 5050 chance it would either be set underwater or in a prison sadly, we never got an underwater prison flick.

But this is the least of Dereks problems as rogue government agent and mob stoolie Col. Burgess John Saxon, who also directs is using the prison as a testing ground for a new supervirus. This is the only flick Saxon directed during his storied career. For a guy who has worked with tons of directors, it appears the only ones he picked up any tips from were the cheapo Italian ones. Sure, it is low budget, but that cannot excuse the stilted staging, shooting gaffes, or clumsy exposition in the first 15 minutes. To his credit, Saxon did make it slightly gory and he works in a hilarious nude scene our lead falls asleep during a prison riot only to fantasize about a female scientist. Cole, who looks like a more rugged JanMichael Vincent, is decent as the stoic lead and Franciosa  sporting a really bad rug  gives it his all as the clich\u00e9 mob boss.

Necromancy has major flaws and is just out and out bad. I saw the version on video called Rosemarys Disciples. Yes, I am sure it differs from other versions, but I am not inclined to think that in any way is any other version and the few more minutes it might have  going to be really any better. The story is perhaps the biggest problem the film opens with Laurie waking up and her husband taking her to a town where he has a new job at a toy factory for occultistsyep, it gets bad this early!. The town is called Lillith and has some guy with a rifle on the bridge to make sure only those selected by the owner of the town are allowed in. Soon we find that everyone living in Lillith is a witch and all follow the directives of Mr. Cato  the head of this municipal coven who wants his dead son backhence the name Necromancy. The people in the town do witch kind of stuff  have ceremonies, some like wearing a goats head, and promiscuity aboundsnot much really shown in this area, but none of these people are very good actors. Mr. Cato is played robustly by the figuratively and literally largerthanlife movie maverick Orson Welles. Welles is misused, but, make no mistake, he is the best thing in this movie. And that is really the saddest part of Necromancy as Welles gives a pretty poor and pedestrian performance with little directorial guidance. In one scene at a party, director Bert I Gordon keeps going back to Welles watching the action of the party using the exact same frames! It looked ridiculous. As did the scene that was repeatedly seen over and over again of a womans arm centered in swirling flames after a car crash. It looked like the arm of a shop mannequin. The story is never fully utilized as we never really know what happens many scenes are shot like dreams or hallucinations and never confirmed. This also applies to the corny, hokey ending. The lead Pamela Franklin is pert and pretty and has some talent. Other than her performance, real slim pickings from the rest of the cast sans Welles.

Whaaaaa?????? I think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder 2 at the most, not FIRST DEGREE murder. Give me a break! But the plot required him being found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to prison for life. Whatever. 2 the hubbys lawyer, after the conviction and sentencing, tells Kay that it is all HER fault. His reasoning is that if she had not gone over to the actors room, then her husband would not have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him. He tells her that she is the guilty one, not her husband, and she nods and agrees. What. The. Hell?!?!?!

This movie is quite the opposite of perverted or sleazy, in fact, and merely just qualifies as boring, inept and terribly bad. Necromancy makes at least one top five ranking, namely in the list of most incoherent movies ever made! Now, director Bert I. Gordon is not exactly famous for delivering masterpieces on his repertoire there are titles like Earth vs. the Spider, King Dinosaur and Food of the Gods but he really surpassed himself here with a totally senseless, redundant and utterly nonsensical tale about witchcraft and secretive little towns. Shortly after the tragic experience of seeing their baby being born dead, Lori and her husband Frank move to the quiet little town of Lillith, where Frank suddenly got offered a prominent job in a toy factory. Lori is suspicious and senses an atmosphere of morbidity, especially with the towns patriarch and owner Mr. Cato behaving very obtrusive and mysterious. That is another thing. How can anybody own a town and everybody in it? Either way, Lori gradually discovers that everybody in Lillith is a witch and Mr. Cato exclusively lured her to the town because of her supernatural ability to resurrect the dead.

Why is not anyone allowed to have children for as long as Catos son remains dead? That is just really selfish! When, where and how did Lori suddenly learn to resurrect the dead? Necromancy definitely contains a few genuinely uncanny and atmospheric moments, but these are unwarily accomplished either by complete coincidence or through a total lack of budget. The grainy photography provides the film with an eerie ambiance and the set pieces look cheap enough to be creepy. Orson Welles performance \u0096 undoubtedly the low point of his career \u0096 is pitiable, and still it is the best aspect about the entire movie.","label":0},{"index":6734,"txt":"I watched the Canadian videotape of this movie as The Witching which somehow made its way to New York State. Audio was quite bad, I had to raise it to about 78 just to hear it and the soundtrack often was overwhelming the dialog. Orson Welles was a mumbler, worse than usual, and some of his dialog and of others was run through an echo chamber. A ghostly figure who keeps reappearing had her voice distorted. Some closed captions would really have helped!A group of witches or satanists the end credits say the group was not meant to represent any real group! have a ritual in which they get naked and cause a miscarriage by stabbing a doll. The woman who had the miscarriage and her husband move to a town named Lilith, where he is been offered a job at a toy factory. Despite one of the AKAs of this movie apparently being The Toy Factory, we never see it, and it is only occasionally referred to at all.On the way to Lilith, her husband gets impatient with some of her questions about what his new boss Mr. Cato wanted to know about their religious persuasion. He drives aggressively, and causes another car to go off the road and blow up. After the police arrive, she takes a doll that fell out of the car, the second of many handmade dolls in the movie.It turns out Mr. Cato and all the townspeople are witches, and that they are the ones who caused her miscarriage, though she does not realize it. They want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy, of which she was not really aware.Some images in the movie have some impact, but on the whole the movie is not very involving. The movie does seem a bit of a mess, and this is no doubt largely due to its re editing and the addition of new footage. The original version, according to the end credits, was called Necromancy  A Life for a Life.

The director though seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream sequences. By the finale, there are too many unanswered questions. What is worse, as the story is so confusing, it is pretty hard to root for any of the characters. It seems odd that Welles would agree to headline this film especially since he does not have that much to do. Maybe someday they will put out a tape of the outtakes and bloopers from this movie.

Extremely unsettling.My main objection here is HOW DARE THE FILMMAKERS BURY CUTEASABUTTON PAMELA FRANKLIN ALIVE. HOW DARE THEY.Seriously she is all like adorable and stuff but in the two movies I have seen her in  this crapfest and the otherwise excellent Legend of Hell House  they kill her off.I would like to put the film industry on notice.

The soundtrack reminded me of something you would hear on The Equalizer. It is really bad.Also, they made Pamela Franklin squash her charming English accent, which was also quite rude, if not a cruel atrocity against the viewer such as you might find covered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I say that we have a right to hear Pamela Franklin speak in her own voice. Who is with me? I could forgive everything else about this film if they did not abuse Pamela Franklin.

I would seen a still from it on an old horror tome of my fathers the actors presence in a film about diabolism seemed like a great idea which could not possibly miss, but the end result \u2013 particularly in this bastardized edition \u2013 is a disaster! I honestly felt sorry for Welles who looks bored and, rather than in his deep and commanding voice, he mutters the inane demonic invocations almost in whispers!! The plot is, basically, yet another retread of ROSEMARYS BABY 1968 a couple is invited to a remote community under false pretenses and soon discover themselves to be surrounded by diabolists. The girl, played by Pamela Franklin, ostensibly has supernatural powers passed on from her mother, who appears intermittently throughout to warn her \u2013 though, as delivered in an intense manner through clenched teeth, the latters speeches end up being largely incoherent and the fount of immense hilarity every time she appears! and is expected to revive Welles deceased young son from the dead!! For what it is worth, Franklin \u2013 a genre regular, right down from her debut performance in THE INNOCENTS 1961 \u2013 is not bad in her role which requires some nudity and experiences several semieerie hallucinations during the course of the film; hubby Michael Ontkean, however, is not up to the challenge of his John Cassaveteslike character. Some of the other girls look good as well \u2013 notably Lee Purcell, whose belated decision to help Franklin in escaping from town eventually proves her undoing.Events come to a head in an incredibly muddled climax, which sees the Satanists ultimately turning on Franklin and have her take the revived boys place in the coffin that is gratitude for you!. While the added scenes do stick out the hilarious opening ceremony and other wouldbe erotic embellishments, the overall quality of the film would have still been poor without them; then again, this particular version is further sunk by the tackedon electronic score \u2013 which is wholly inappropriate, and cheesy in the extreme!","label":0},{"index":6738,"txt":"Like most comments I saw this film under the name of The Witching which is the reissue title.

No diabolique rumpy pumpy involved!This movie is so inherently awful it is difficult to know what to criticise first. The dialogue is awful and straight out of the Troma locker. At least Troma is tongue in cheek though. This is straightfaced boredom personified. The acting is variable with Pamela Franklin Flora the possessed kid in The Innocents would you believe! the worst with her highpitched screechy voice. Welles seems merely waiting for his pay cheque. The other female lead has a creepy face so I do not know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the film! And the doctor is pretty bad too. He also looks worringly like Gene Wilder.It is ineptly filmed with scenes changing for no reason and editing is choppy. This is because the witching is a copy and paste job and not a subtle one at that. Only the lighting is OK. The sound is also dreadful and it is difficult to hear with the appalling new soundtrack which never shuts up. The ghost mother is also equally rubbish but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that at least it provides some unintentional laughs.Really this film the witching at least is only for the unwary.

And now Orson Welles was starring in a thirdrate flick about a satanic cult.There is basically nothing creative about this movie. Lots of nudity, but the background music always proves really distracting. Even if the movie was not particularly predictable, it still was not worth seeing. How low Welles had sunk. Fortunately, over the final thirteen years of his life, he narrated the documentary Bugs Bunny Superstar about the Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1940s and hosted the documentary The Man who Saw Tomorrow about Nostradamus.

This film does have some atmospheric moments, but about half the dialogue is hard to make out sometimes it is poorly recorded, at other times just incomprehensible and Orson Welles, who gets top billing, has a role that is so BENEATH him that you have to assume he was desperate for the work.

There will not be much, and what there is you could do in your backyard with a cheap costume and a camcorder; it would look better than this movie.It is not that I do not like 1970s low budge fare; I do.

It does not fit into the so bad it is good category, nor can you get a laugh out of how bad it is without the help of illicit substances. It is mostly a lot of boring footage of the people camping, hiking, riding horses, and watching wild life.

Those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first, and the story simply tacked on. For this reason we often talk of the story jumping through hoops as it twists about, trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashion.The story in Comet Over Broadway does not just jump through hoops, it is a three ring circus. It is so ludicrous, so illconceived, so disingenuous that, if you are prone to speaking aloud to the screen, you will be carrying on quite a rant before it is through.The central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession. Since it is all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion.

As a more jaded adult, I have largely given up on the big guy now, but do not mind watching the odd movie when I come across one. This one had a few strong points to it  mainly, the recreations of two of the more famous Bigfoot encounters  the Ape Canyon incident of 1924 and the Bauman incident of c.1850 as related to and by Teddy Roosevelt, both of which I am somewhat familiar with from that youthful reading I did. The movie takes for granted that both incidents involved a sasquatch, whereas both incidents have more plausible explanations, but the recreations were well done. There is also homage paid at the beginning of the movie to the famous Patterson video, again taking for granted its authenticity. The sasquatch encounter at the end of the movie was also very well done and had a very creepy feel to it as the sasquatch were portrayed mainly in the shadows or as hairy feet running past the terrified men. Unfortunately, in total those four things might have composed about 20 minutes, whereas the movie as a whole is slightly over an hour and a half.It is the fictional story done in a documentary style of an expedition to a remote area of northern British Columbia, to the suspected home range of the sasquatch. A computer had targeted this area based on sightings and  in one of the more amusing scenes in the movie  the computer also used eyewitness sightings to draw a picture of a sasquatch that looked exactly like the creature of the Patterson video! Aside from those 20 minutes I mentioned, we basically watch this expedition travel, which means we get to watch a bunch of guys go on a long camping trip. I have been on camping trips with the guys. Let me tell you  they have never been worthy of a movie. Interspersed among the long stretches of boredom are some nice wildlife shots although one suspects that canned footage was used, or perhaps even captive animals performing as wild animals and there are some spectacular scenery shots, except that the scenery is not of northern British Columbia, it is from national parks in Oregon.I did appreciate that we were never given a real picture of the sasquatch, so we did not have to deal with the bad makeup that would have been part of this. 310","label":0},{"index":6745,"txt":"Fiction film it lists as based on a story though it does have a documented by credit about a group of scientists going into the wilds of Canada to try and find a Bigfoot.They want to capture one and then attach a tracking device.

Her story speaks to us in modern times particularly because of the ageold accusation that all great artists were men  she pretty much blasts that assertion to bits  and because the story of her rape trial is so poignant. Not only was she clearly assaulted, and forced into a degrading sexual relationship because in those days marriage to your assaulter was the only way to avoid social shame, but Tassi was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and child.The movie does a terrible disservice by inverting this truly fascinating and remarkable real life story  very dramatic and not in need of any spicing up  because in some weird Frencified way, it is hotter to have an oversexed teenager drawing male sexual organs and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather. That is sexy  the truth is boring and seems too feministpolitically correct.It also disturbs me that this is ONLY part of Artemisia life considered interesting enough to film. The fact that she painted for decades her famous painting of Judith beheading Holfernes was painted AFTER, not before the rape, that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious Florentine Academy, that she went on to have children...oh that is boring stuff. After all, that is about a middle aged woman and they are not hot like teenagers.I understand that there is a lot of creative license in making a film or a book about a real historical character. You need to create dialog, have subplots, create dramatic structure. Certainly some details can be sacrificed  it is no big deal if the dates are moved a few years, or if Artemisia is played by a blonde actress when we know from her self portraits that she was a brunette...and a big boned one, not a skinny minny, or something like that. But to turn her story around on her, and make rape into a romance is actually sick and disturbing. It is even worse because the director is female.

This film has no clear plot unlike other films such as Black Hawk Down. What this film tries to do is focus more on the characters, and their different attitudes about the war.

I stayed conscious, for the entire movie.Honestly speaking, I think that this movie gained its place in fame based on the subconscious appeal of American patriotism, a healthy and genuine feeling, but not the adequate use as a movie fame generator. More than a movie about war, it grows its popularity based on that.A simple thought if this was a world war II or I movie, only changing time, with everything remained the same, would it be this awarded? Sure not. Why? Because there are great ones that elevate the bar way to high.Compared against its rivals in the Oscars, I do not think that all of the prizes it won are correctly awarded.","label":0},{"index":6762,"txt":"I went to see this movie simply to see what all the hype is about, and I was as disappointed as surprised about how it got 6?

Did the totally unrealistic cowboy bomb disposalman storyline mean anything to somebody that I failed see? Why did I keep getting the mental image that this movie was a remake of some old bad Western movie about a cowboy doing brave deeds in the Wild Wild West infected with evil Red Indians; but just that it was set in a different background this time? Was it given the Oscars because the director being ex of James Cameron, and made it a nice underdog gossipy story for day time TV shows to munch on? Or was it some sort of Emperors Clothes syndrome  where most people realized it was junk but just could not say so because others did not seem to be saying it out aloud?And finally what was with that sniper scene where they showed the shell casing dropping in highresolutionsuperslowmo as if to convey a deep message or something? Something in the lines of EOD guys make good snipers all of a sudden and they will get the filthy terrorists all the time? Was it just me who felt like there were so many bits and pieces here and there in the movie squeezed in for no apparent reason?

As has been said before, this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure; its portrayal of her life and person have little or nothing to do with the real Artemisia Gentileschi. The script is awful  pretentious, stilted, and vapid  and its rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that all too often makes its living by distorting, rather than retelling, history. Along with some fairly decent set design, Valentina Cervis physical charms are the primary asset of this movie, and it is obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too; they waste no time in contriving various erotic sequences which have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development. Unfortunately, the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal cannot, and does not, sustain this movie. The acting is unremarkable, and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two. The cinematography is OK, and there are some pretty colors, but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distortedlens effects more appropriate for a 1960s freakout movie than a costume drama. In any event, the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on Artemisias body, and all too seldom on her paintings.All told, a nearcomplete failure.

They mirrored my own thoughts; as the movie played I  a complete civilian  kept thinking to myself, say WHAT? there is no way that would happen like that.. 2 There is very little that actually happens in terms of plot. A new bomb disposal guy shows up to replace one who was killed a death that is not really clearly explained. The new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work. His attitude puts others at risk.

If you want to see a war movie that is emotionally powerful, try renting Go Tell The Spartans, which is about the Vietnam War, and stars Burt Lancaster who told me PERSONALLY in a serendipitous supermarket encounter that it was a film he was immensely proud of and one he viewed as some of his finest work, and which he was still upset had been largely ignored in the wake of the overhyped Apocalypse Now, or an old WWII black and white classic Sink The Bismark, which, especially for an English film, is unbelievably heartwrenching.

But the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and is constantly shaking. This has been a recent fad in film making and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap, documentary look to it.

So I would like to think my review is an accurate one IMHO. Having just watched this film on DVD I can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish. There is no way I can recommend this film to you.It started off with me shouting at the TV saying you would not do that etc...but I soon realised that having a bit of job experience would be a hindrance so I chilled a bit. But on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off I got a nasty feeling that this film would be a predictable dud...I was right.There simply was not any logic to the EOD scenes. I just know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger. So much so I was left scratching my head all the time. Then just when you think you know where the story is going the guys in the Humvee are off out on their own driving around the desert. One of the most valuable assets in theatre out on a jolly bumping into some SAS wannabe contractors.The sniper scene was just so laughable. It just made no sense at all and made me want to switch off there and then. Then for them to drag it out so long really did test my patience.It started with the Contact Right and went down hill fast. If you had a Brit accent then you got shot but if you were part of the EOD team then suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day. Then just as you thought it was over it stretched on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all. You are just left watching and asking why has not it ended yet?Then we had the booze scene where they just hit each other for a laugh..another scene where you just wanted it to end. It added nothing to the film.Then just as my life seemed very dull the main star went outside the wire to hunt someone down. This most be the most ridiculous scene I have ever watched. It defied all logic and ability to write a good storyline...it was senseless and awful. I still do not understand why they wasted time on it. Then to watch him just jog through the busy streets heading back to camp had me rolling on the floor with laughter. Pure comedy The sad fact is that this storyline is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be. I thought it was going to be stupid illogical EOD scenes but then it kept going off on tangents trying to be something different. But as hard as it tried it just bored me to death. All I wanted was for it to end. It was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed into a batch of stupid, senseless, actionish scenes.There is no way I can recommend this. Maybe my work experience compromised the enjoyability but even the naive must realise this just does not make sense. The only thing more stupid than this film is the artificially high IMDb rating...which must be the 247 work of the box office PR team who seem to use this website as a way of making everyone think it is good.

I worked with the bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for them. Other vets, and Iraq vets in particular, have summarized the inaccuracies in this movie very well. Poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy, and fails badly because of it. No bomb disposal unit, or any unit, would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes. Military units prize conformity and discipline for a reason;it saves lives. The opening scene particularly annoyed me. The guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately. Yelling, Stop dialing is not an effective deterrent. It got worse from there. The scenes with the sniper were particularly egregious. As others have noted, your average EOD guy does not know jack about being a sniper, and to think any Arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination. Kidnapping an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just would not happen. Somebody might shoot him, but this kind of risktaking is limited to the movies. I could go on, but, as I said, others have pointed these things out in detail.

As Bigelow posits the Iraq war as the backdrop of the grand stage of human drama, one veteran bomb expert gets blown up and another shows up to replace him in the dusty, hot, ugly rubble that is Iraq, and a new hero is born.The new guy is what John Hershey described in his book, and later the movie, The War Lover, as a sadistic wingnut who actually is not fit for civilian life, and requires the stimulation of war to sublimate and suppress his errant sexual desires. The war lover can only fully function in war, peacetime suffocates him. While Hershey chastised the war lover, played in the film by Steve McQueen in one of his greatest roles Bigelow glorifies him. The army needs war lovers, they are the bulwark of defense against our enemies. We cannot handle the truth, that it is war lovers who are the best soldiers, the toughest men. According to the unironic Bigelow, regular men are pussies, the war lover is a special breed, the last of the cowboys. So what if he wants to bareback his men, or fondle an Iraqi boy? He is a throwback to the sexanddeath cult of war. In war, sex is a thankless, loveless, do notask, do nottell kind of male bonding. Bigelow has no opinion on this; she just limits the options of masculinity in this hamfisted attempt at realism. Only a warlover can win the moral struggle between right and wrong, between American innocence and Arab perfidy. Bigelow disguises her racism and arrogance behind the ingenuous facade of journalism. She is just another gungho yahoo depicting a brutal war against civilians as a moral triumph of the spirit.On the political front, Bigelow returns to the western genre and its relentless clich\u00e9s again and again, ad nauseam the wonderful world of the open frontier, which happens to be some one elses country. You can shoot people here says a soldier ; the tough but human black guy companion, the soldier with a premonition of death, the gruff, possibly crazy commanding officer, the collegeeducated fool who tries to befriend the enemy. You name it, Bigelow resurrects it.The manboy love is palpable in scenes with the cute Arab boy who befriends the war lover, but Bigelow plays it straight; she does not consummate the sex, just sanitizes it. What Bigelow really wants to show us is the ugly, sneering face of the Arab enemy. Any Iraqi who is not pure evil is either demented, hostile or up to no good, anyway. They all deserve to die for their impudence, and many of them do in this glib gorefest film. The Iraqi women are all hysterical, they only make their presence known by screaming. They could be male stunt men in drag for all I know, you never see their faces. There is no female presence at all on base or in battle, although female casualty rates in Iraq would certainly disprove this.Bigelow goes through all the motions one by one. She glorifies war, she canonizes the sadist nutcase hero. The cowboys, surrounded by the subhuman Indians, prove their mettle by doing Gods work and subduing the wretched terroristinfested hellhole with sheer bravado and suicidal mania. Toward the end, I felt like rooting for the Indians. In Bigelows world, though, no mercy or understanding ever makes it through. The Iraqis are dehumanized par excellence. The slaughter of civilians is just the dramatic backdrop to our heros psycho sexual struggle. Every U.S, bullet finds its mark. You have to love the guy, the war lover. It is just his way, he is the true hero. He is just a guy trying to get things done the hard way, and so what if he lusts for boy tang on the side.","label":0},{"index":6782,"txt":"I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and incredulous. The first shot is a camera feed from a robot traveling towards a bomb and is, naturally, shaky. But then the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode, even during quiet conversational moments, to the point of ridiculousness. Have the rental houses run out of tripods and Steadicams? The fact that it was shot on 16mm does not help, as the entire movie is grainy as well as shaky. For all the effort Bigelow put into accurate vehicles and equipment, there are enough glaring errors and inconsistencies that they undermine the movies credibility.  A car would not erupt in flames after a single shot, and once engulfed would not be extinguished by a small handheld extinguisher.  A single Humvee would not be driving around Baghdad in 2004, but would be backed up by other vehicles in case of breakdown or attack.  It would be exceptionally unlikely to be able to hit a running insurgent at long range, where the bullet is clearly taking over a second to reach the target.  I believe bombs were brought to designated disposal areas on or near a base, not some random spot in the middle of the desert.  The oil tanker attack is stated to have occurred in the Green Zone, a highly secure area that experienced very few attacks from within. The zone is mostly offices and palaces with few residences, yet it is portrayed as a dangerous warren of dark alleys and lurking insurgents. Oddly, James never gets in trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering his two companions to each take an alley by themselves, thus setting up the attempted kidnapping.  Speaking of which, the 3man team is always depicted clearing buildings, chasing insurgents etc. on their own, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there.  How many hours does the team have to stare at a dead insurgent hanging out a window to figure out he is not faking it?There were no establishing shots to show the viewer what the size and layout of the base was or where Baghdad was in relation. I had no idea who the EOD team reported to, nor were any other characters fleshed out. These are things the characters would know, so we should too.Many of the surprises and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it is obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will get into trouble with the Iraqis he is trying to move along, that the choice of cereals back home will be overwhelming, and that a driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle.Finally, there was an almost complete lack of character development. Renners character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home, is reckless and addicted to adrenalin. He is exactly the same at the end of the movie. What is the point?If this is indeed the best so far of the Iraqi war movies, it is a sorry bunch. Just based on the half hour I saw of it, I would recommend Generation Kill on HBO instead.","label":0},{"index":6783,"txt":"For the life of me I can not understand the blind hype and devotion to this totally unbelievable movie......and I think I have the qualifications to say so....

Todd Sheets is still the director, but no longer the screenwriter, which is not a negative or a positive, considering he is just as untalented as the guy who wrote this one. The writing is too heavily reliant on the fword, which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times at nausea. The acting is about on par with the last two Bloodbath movies, so naturally, it is some of the worst I have ever seen. The special effects are better than the last 2, but they still look godawful. The plot has become too complicated for it is own good, and was about some government experiment gone wrong and zombies being produced. Also featured is cryogenically frozen mutant zombie and school kids that know how to time travel, leading to one of the most idiotic endings I have ever seen.

I am surprised it has an NC17 rating nowthere is no hardcore sex and it only has topless females and no male nudity at all. Also it is sadly pretty dull and the addition of politics at the end was confusing and pretty silly. It is worth catching though to see what was considered very shocking in 1968.

I am not familiar with Mingliang Tsai movies, and I am very familiar with art cinema; I grow up in the seventies times of Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others.Art movies then were really ART; like paints. People did it to express their inner feelings, not really worried about if other people understand anything. They were beyond commercial values; just look some old Antonioni or early Picasso and you will understand.Tian bian yi duo yun The Wayward Cloud has nothing to do with that. It is an opportunistic movie, intended to fool festival judges and critics, playing many things without saying anything.The story makes no sense. The lack of water makes the government to promote the use of watermelons to hydrate. A girl in desperation, steal water from the public bathrooms WC. There is also a porno start neighbor trying to make a movie with an actress he does not seems to feel comfortable with. There is some romantic awakening between the girl and the porno star. The mess ends with a sexual scene not pornographic that many people feel shocked about, but I believe it is less provocative than you can see in American Pie or History of Violence.The two main characters never talk. Sometimes, a musical number 60 style appears and explains through a song what is happening in characters minds. These video clips, are really welcomed because the previous scene, without dialog or music only people looking at each other, takes sometimes 4, 5 or even more minutes which in movie times is TOO MUCH. There is also a few bits about the difficult to make sex without love, the selfish mind of the porno industry. It is obvious, this movie intended get away with it to fool festival juries and critics. It have a few pseudoshocking scenes within the limits of Taiwan censorship and many subjects are open, but nothing is concluded or goes anywhere. These tricks, got the movie a few disputed important prices in film festivals and get the movie an undeserved commercial success I see the movie in France and the theater was packed. However, please, do not be fooled. There is nothing new or original or even originally told or filmed in this movie. It is boring and empty; really a fraud to public.

Though you laugh several times but it is really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun. To disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie videoclips into the movie. They are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50s but it is hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it is really sad. Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something, that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that is it. Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music. The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost. Personally I cannot recommend the movie.

It oozes laziness from its every frame. So I am not going to analyse it thoroughly either. But some observations1. If the premise is drought, why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees? I wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film in which thirst notifies the craving for intimacy, and watermelon the trivial substitute, sex. Or it is only a matter of lousy filmmaking, not giving a damn about being coherent.2. We do not get to know what had happened to the porn actress, why she is unconscious or, presumably, dead. It seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully bombastically delivered, but in retrospect, her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick, a pretext \u0096 just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed in.3. Nothing is expressed in this movie that Antonioni had not expressed better 40 years ago \u0096 and without needlessly humiliating his actors.4. The musical numbers recycled from The Hole felt like a secondaryschoolers idea of artistic counterpointing, executed on that very secondaryschool level of skill. If that was the point, the point sucked.","label":0},{"index":6829,"txt":"The Wayward Cloud is a frustrating film to watch. Infuriatingly enigmatic, it treats each shot like a work of art. You get the impression that the composition of each shot has been designed and prepared with a degree of exquisite care that borders on obsession; Expressing how far cinema has progressed since the very first films were cranked out in the nineteenth century and mimicking their construction, the camera here hardly ever moves \u0096 apart from during the camp and colourful musical numbers. Ambient noise is kept to a minimum and barely a word is spoken. This curious but effective device forces the audience to focus their attention on visual stimuli alone so that, even as the story progresses at a snaillike pace we feel ourselves becoming immersed. Unfortunately, for me at least, this immersion begins to unravel somewhere around the hour mark. I began to feel as if the film was challenging me to keep watching while becoming more difficult as the minutes dragged so that the mere act of watching became a battle of wills.Had the content of this film not been as sexual as it is it would no doubt been even more obscure to Western audiences. As it is, there is an abundance of female nudity and an act of sexual abuse on an unconscious or possibly dead woman that is so repugnant that, while it may speak volumes about the degradation to which pornography subjects both men and women the users and the used it is so overzealous in the manner in which it chooses to make its point as to effectively render it ineffective. Of course the worst and most enthusiastic participants of the explosion in available pornographic content will seek this film out for all the wrong reasons and watch it with their sticky finger on the fastforward button of the remote.For all its problems, the film is definitely a stayer, and the more you think about it the more sense certain aspects of it seem to make.

This version remains pretty faithful to Dahls original story so one cannot lay the blame on John Hambleys script. If anything the fault lies with the colourless animation, the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voiceovers. One would be right to expect this story to make for a happy, vibrant, funfilled movie..... instead, the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch. Children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first! All the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a childrens classic.Young orphan Sophie voice of Amanda Root lives in a nonetoofriendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of Mrs Clonkers. One evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street. The figure realises it has been seen, so it reaches in through the window and scoops Sophie from her bed, placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night. Sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from Giant Country, and fears that he will eat her. But to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the BFG voice of David Jason. The BFG refuses to eat people, instead restricting himself to foultasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers. However, Giant Country is populated by numerous other giants who DO feast  every night, as it happens  on poor unsuspecting humans. Sophie and the BFG become great friends, and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants. Together they go to the Queen of England voice of Angela Thorne with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the maneating giants. The Queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else.Jason voices the BFG quite well one of the few pluses in the film but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality. The rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired, with very little to bring the characters to life. Similarly, the BFG is the only character that is imaginatively animated  Sophie lacks appeal, and the giants are boringly designed and look almost indistinguishable from each other. Even the places are uninventive; Giant Country especially comes up short, being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons. At 88 minutes the film is not exactly lengthy, yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences. Little of Dahls mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily. One chapter in the book deals with the BFGs love of whizzpopping farting and is laughoutloud hilarious. In the film, the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling. I came to the The BFG expecting lots of zest, fun and enjoyment, but what I got was pretty much the opposite! This one is a failed misfire that simply does not match the calibre of the book in any department  unfortunately, therefore, it must go down as one to skip.","label":0},{"index":6835,"txt":"Almost in the same league as Yonfans rather atrocious Color Blossoms, Spider Lillies drives the point home that you can make cutting edge cinema without the edge, or much in the way of cutting. It is a Taiwanese film, which in this day and age is becoming a novelty at an alarming pace, but more than that tidbit, we can find very little in the way of the noteworthy here.You should know that ostensibly Spider Lillies is also a lesbianthemed story, but in every aspect this is nothing but a plastic ploy to lure in the easily seduced and gullible. In several ways we have here a repeat of fellow recent Taiwan release Eternal Summer. Then it was gay men getting the shortchange treatment, now we have the same thing with women. Zero Chou presents, for your nonexistent edification, a tale likely to titillate at most a fifteen year old. They managed some of the art house stance, but in the end this results in a most inane, simply uninteresting foray.The Hong Kong angle comes in the form of Isabella Leung Bug Me Not, Isabella, Diary, here sporting her most butch look yet. Although somewhat likable in her previous jobs, Isabella in Spider Lillies is listless and lacking in most departments. Either her heart was not into it or the whole lesbian drama pitch did not quite appeal to her sensibilities.She does a Taipei tattoo artist who is shy, reclusive and in charge of a mentally challenged younger brother, played by John Shen, who thankfully grants the movie its only thespianrelated redeeming feature. Isabellas character, oddly named Takeko but supposedly hailing from Hong Kong, soon hooks up with disaffected youth Jade Rainie Yang from fondlyrecalled Meteor Garden. The latter lives with her grandmother and has a whole list of grievances due to being left behind by her parents and life in general. Sure, the grandmother component works well and is touching, but otherwise Jade as a protagonist is just as unmoving as her counterpart Takeko.The two women share a past and lots of inadequately covered angst, with Jade working as a webcam girl while Takeko keeps her fathers legacy alive with a unique tattoo of a spider lilly emblazoned on her arm. Jade also wants to acquire this very design, which leads to Takeko exploring internal feelings of the issue via flashbacks and rather minimal discourse with the spunky Jade.Well, if there is little discourse to write the homebase about, is at least the intercourse memorable? In a word, no. They kiss and feign doing the nasty close to the end, but just as Eternal Summer reminded us not long ago, there is a gulf measured in lightyears between showing sexual content and making ticket buyers think they are about to see sexual content.This cynical expectationbuilding seals Spider Lillies fate. With a weak story, hohum acting and an overall dearth of relics to take away from the theater with you, this one kind of makes Color Blossoms look good, come to think of it. At least there we got a bit of Teresa Cheungs mammaries. No, Spider Lillies is no AV masterpiece and should be stricken from the playlist of even the most mundane and timid GLB movie festival.Amazingly for a pseudoindie release, not even the soundtrack and cinematography produce moments of inspiration. That is just as well, since it makes passing on Spider Lillies much easier.

Unfortunately, as this is made for TV, the cool compositional details he uses so well with a wider image are nowhere to be found. Note to producers give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you hire him.Summing it up this film is bad by cinema standards and mediocre by TV standardswatch CSI, instead.

When we learn that she has been diagnosed with a life threatening illness I could not help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss for poor Oliver or if anyone watching this film would even care.

Yet, it was a hugely popular success perhaps because the idea of fatalistic young love must have appealed to audiences saturated by constant TV coverage of the Vietnam War. The plot is pure drivel as it concerns Oliver Barrett IV, a privileged Harvard hockey player, who meets and falls in love with Jenny Cavelleri, an antagonistic Vassar music student proud of her working class background. His oldschool father naturally disapproves of Jenny, and in a typical act of rebellion, that means the young couple gets married in one of those hippieera, extemporaneous ceremonies. He lands his dream job in New York, but she gets unexpectedly ill and dies of her terminal disease. There is a veneer of thencontemporary filmmaking techniques displayed by director Arthur Hiller, but none of that can hide the oldfashioned, clich\u00e9ridden story at its core. The inevitable ending left me particularly unmoved.Both Ryan ONeal and Ali MacGraw became stars with this movie as Oliver and Jenny but inexplicably so since neither seems able to convey the depth or complexity required to make their characters compelling. At least the boyish ONeal is sincere in his weakly defiant approach, but MacGraw is so wooden and smirky in behavior that it is hard to see what Oliver sees in Jenny beyond her sarcastic fa\u00e7ade. John Marley two years before finding the decapitated racehorse in his bed in The Godfather does better as Jennys plainspoken baker father Phil, as does Ray Milland as the seemingly insensitive Barrett paterfamilias. The overly familiar Frances Lai music has almost become parody in itself over the years. The print quality on the DVD is good, though the only extra is a rather effusive commentary track by Hiller. The most interesting bit of trivia is that author Erich Segal upon whose book this movie is based conceived Oliver as a mix between two Harvard roommates he knew \u0096 Vice President Al Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones, who happens to have a bit part in the movie as one of Olivers roommates.","label":0},{"index":6851,"txt":" SPOILER WARNING Absolutely without a doubt, one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen. Totally impossible to take any of this seriously. It would take a major novel to list all of the comedy routines in it.

Carol played Jenny who suddenly became ill with only a slight cough and immediately the treacly music came up and everyone looked around wondering where it was coming from. Harvey Korman played Oliver with flowing locks and almost look liked Ryan ONeal. The only thing funnier than this bit, is the real film.What a death scene at the end. Jenny really looks like she is dying alright...dying for her makeup artist to come in and give her a little color. And of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to get in bed with them during the patients final moments.

No I do not mean virgins, it is the music company, as it does get in numerous shots and Helsings daughter works there too. Oh that was not obvious planting. The soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes. Now the performances are all over the shop, but there are few familiar faces to spot Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro.

A fight breaks out , theres lots of noise but the bad guys in the cockpit dont hear a sound until the script demands it . It also appears in this segments climax that Dracula can control the weather but this seems forgotten about as the film progresses . Sloppy scripting , and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where theres numerous scenes of characters being at the New Orleans mardi gras then the characters being at a different location such as police station in the following scene then theyre back at the mardi gras the scene after that which means the lack of credibilty in the plot is enhanced Theres something else that yanked my chain  Product placement .

I have now watched the first 4 episodes of Cavemen and have yet to manage even a smirk. Not a titter, a guffaw, a chortle, as a matter of fact, no facial movement at all. I will continue to punish myself by watching every future episode because I am convinced that I am clearly missing something in this show. I am simply not getting it, but I believe that a comedy on a major TV network in primetime, just HAS to be funny; but there are no laughs from me YET.

Unfortunately, that really is the only question, because there is no doubt that it does.For those unfamiliar with the premise of the show, the doomedtobeshortlived series Cavemen focuses on a number of Neanderthals and their struggle to exist in modern day America and is based on the characters featured in a series of television ads for Geico Insurance. The concept is solid and there is every reason to think it could be executed successfully.I had to think about it for awhile, but then the tagline from the commercials  something to the effect of We are not that much different from you provided me with the key to the show is suckiness. Even though cavemenNeanderthals are actually a different species than humanity, the title characters of this show, it turns out, are exactly the same as those of us who are boring jerks.Maybe its my background as a game writer  rather than a soulless, hack, committeebased writer from California  but this show had so much potential, and none of it has been realized. To start with, the producers should have focused on the fun things that would make cavemen different from us.What could conceivably be funny, for example, about giving them occupations like perpetual grad student and furniture store clerk, when they would have more compellingly been drawn to things like subterranean utility workers and guides at cave parks? Why would they play prosaic games like squash, when a whole episode could be devoted to them trying get hunting licenses to go after game with spears? A show like this could write itself, and it takes some willfully bad writing to make it quite so crappy and boring.Another tiresome aspect of this show is an attempt to portray the cavemen as being subjected to a number of stereotypes associated with various human minorities. Yawn! This has been done so many times before, and never more drearily than this. And, as noted previously, Neanderthals really are a different species, so using them as a metaphor for racial stereotyping is both uncompelling and off the mark.Responses are welcome, including those from anyone who wants to tell me why I am wrong.

Dieter is the first name of a quite popular German musician, who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and thats exactly what this movie is about. It is based on the autobiography Dieter Bohlen wrote a few years ago but is not meant to be accurate on that. The movie is filled with some sexual offensive content at least for American standard which is either amusing not for the other actors of course or dumb  it depends on your individual kind of humor or on you being a BohlenFan or not.

The result was a funny book about his life. Well, more or less a fuzzy image of it. He did not deny that he is a selfish asshole but the whole story was twisted to fit his image of himself. No word that he has probably beaten up his former wife and she ended up in hospital. However it was written in a funny style and a huge success after his appearance as jury member of the German version of American Idol  especially his unforgettable comments.This should be the end of the story  really. In the hype of the mentioned Idol TV show called Deutschland sucht den Superstar abbreviated DSDS somebody must have come up with the terrible idea to make a movie out of the book. The result is Dieter  der FilmI have rarely seen a movie which tries so desperately to be funny and fails so completely. None of the gags really hits the point. Naddels voice and style of talking was getting on my nerves right away although Veronas voice should have done that more. Obvious, childish, predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end within a few minutes. The content of the movie is a sloppy film adaption written sloppily down by a ghost writer based on Bohlens sloppy idealized memory. They could have used this freedom to do almost everything. It was supposed to be a satire, but they failed. The story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is Bohlen himself guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical at all.It is no wonder that it was considered to bad for a cinema release. The probability that this thing would have rotten in some archive was quite high until recently when the current season of DSDS turned out to be a mediocre success. With the friendly help of Germanys biggest yellow press newspaper BILD and the desperate situation for the TV station RTL to have something in the program while the still unbeatable show Wetten dass... ? is running on Channel 2 the movie finally arrived in television  unfortunately.Watching this movie is a waste of time  there are certainly better cartoons with much more fun and a story actually worth looking at.Therefore 210","label":0},{"index":6885,"txt":"I have always been enthusiastic about period dramas, an art form in which the BBC has excelled in the past. This presentation of Byron was unbelievable. Unbelievably bad! The script was dreadful, the acting uninspired, and all the characters woefully insipid. Apparently Byron was mad bad and dangerous to know, and set the ladies hearts allaflutter. Not in this production. Here he appeared as a tawdry jumpedup little squirt instead of a fiery hero of womenfolk and the Greek struggle for independence. It is said that Byron walked with a limp. This portrayal of the man was just limp all over.I watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life. Not a splutter, not even a glimmer. It was utter tedium, if not downright boredom, from start to finish.Having the opinion that noone will ever better the Bard of Avon, I also believe that Byrons poetry is overrevered and to my mind should be flung on the back burner, and this dramatisation of his life should be accorded the same treatment.I think the BBC lost its nous with this one","label":0},{"index":6886,"txt":"OK OK, it might be hard to put the entirety of a mans life in one film. Traditionally therefore, biopics focus on one or two significant parts in the subjects life. Now, Byron was a my week beats your year fellow, which makes selecting parts that are representative even harder. Furthermore, just as Byrons poetry is inseparable from his life, the mans life itself must be seen as a whole. Lifting parts out is not only not showing the whole picture, it is showing a different picture altogether.Now, in short my review comes down to this supposedly, Byron was indeed the my week beats your year prototype, a guy who lived so intensely that he indeed did more in his 15 or so active years than most do in an entire lifetime. True, he had setbacks and was a victim of the time and social setting he lived in  but in the end, this dude is supposed to be the prototype whose life we would all want to lead, no? Well, I did NOT, at ANY moment, want to live the life depicted in this film. So it gets 3. Not for being so badly done which, directionwise, it more or less was, but more importantly for missing the point entirely in a flat plot.Some more detail. Well, to over simplify things, a Byron bio should have two distinct episodes 1. Postfirst Europe trip England and his rise to fame  marriage  2. His life abroad. Now, the important thing is that the SECOND part should be at least as important as the first. Not only was it a lot longer, but the most significant change in Byron took place then. Furthermore, it is where he created his best works Don Juan, the Vision of Judgement etc.  all the stuff that makes him really unique in English literature.Instead, in this film a Byrons life never comes across as even remotely entertaining, b it only gets worse after he leaves England. They did two good jobs first, they started at his return of his Europe trip though a bit more of the actual trip would have been welcome as a prologue, second, they chose an angle, and they chose his incestuous love for Augusta who is rather perfectly cast. The problem with this last thing is that they never let it go. True, Byron remained strongly attached to Augusta for the rest of his life, but, especially as he was such a mood swing person, the fact that his letters reflect that does not mean that at other times he might not have completely enjoyed life.Anyway, the first part of the TV film should have ended with him leaving England. There is no doubt about that. The thing is once abroad, a life of debauchery began with the infamous Geneva period, but in Italy Byron also discovered a new life, both for his poetry inspired by Italian comedy, already in Venice, and for himself when he found the Contessa Teresa Guiccioli and moved to Ravenna afterwards, at the request of Shelly, with Teresa, to Pisa. In other words, he was also liberated. His mind and life opened up and not only in the decadent sense, while Englands closed further as it fell into the gravitational pull of the Victorian age. True, freedom was Augustaless, but this bittersweet freedom tastes sour in this film. We see a lonely, bored snob getting older.I mean, hell, Byron never thought much about his poetry, except when he finally found his own voice in Don Juan! Apart from poetic and romantic developments, his relationship with Shelly and the downbreak should have been more documented. Also, it is in Italy in Ravenna that he gets involved with politics and revolutionary ideas. This is important, as it shows that the decadent romantic and ultimately escapist language and person of Childe Harold is changing into the more plantedinlife realistic and lighter passion of the language and person of Don Juan. Life and work are one. True, still a bit naive, but it is what got him to Greece! And the whole thing came full circle in Pisa, where Shelleys revolutionary spirit further ignited the spark. Missolonghi was not the bored snob suddenly looking for some action. It was the insights in Italy the Gambas stirring him into action. It can be a symbol for the man looking for some ancientstyle battle excitement while the rest of Europe becomes fixed in the clay of modern reason and conservatism. But it was not just that, there was a true inspiration behind it. Meanwhile, Byron wrote massive amounts of Don Juan. True, his end is a bit sad, but it is not like he is worn out. THAT is the essence of Byrons life he may have had some strong emotional attachments 2 Augusta and Teresa, but EVERY time he managed to reinvent himself truly. Meaning that he was not less at the end of his life  no, he would made a physical and mental JOURNEY that, at the time, few people were prepared to make.I wonder. Why is it that so often the second period in Byrons life is overlooked? Because it had less obvious conflicts, as the man was finally coming to his own? In focusing our attention on the frustrated England years fraught with scandals, we show ourselves to be not much better than the English aristocracy at the time, which Byron so despised, and which, despite the fact that he had no choice, he willingly fled in 1816, to find a world that was modern and liberal enough to let him find the voice that would make him the first romantic plainspoken language poet and evolve from a selfobsessed snob to a passionate man moving onward with a cause.","label":0},{"index":6887,"txt":"Sloppily directed, witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the classic 50s alien invasion films, but really is no better than them, except of course in the purely technical department good makeup effects.

Batman TAS may be the worst thing to ever happen to cartoons based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has measured up yet. It is just too damn good. Was Batman Beyond good? Yeah, but it was no TAS. Is Justice League good? It is not too bad, but it is no TAS.The Batman is certainly no TAS, either, but I will not hold that against it. It would be unfair and besides, it has plenty of other problems with it.The concept of a younger, less experienced Batman fighting crime is a fine one, and at times the art is very nice. But all of the rest of the time, the art is worthless Americanime, and this betrays a lot of the flaws of the show itself. It is paced, written, and designed like an Americanime. If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan Adventures, I would watch Jackie Chan Adventures. Or I could just bang my head into a wall any time and get the same effect. The Joker is a homicidal, mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits, unpredictability, and clever gadgets to fight Batman. When he is forced to fight hand to hand, he will either resort to something cheap or be totally outmatched. He is not meant to be a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kungfu and can leap into twenty feet into the air, accompanied by speed lines. If they had wanted to do that with a villain, there were other less important characters they could have used or gasp they could have created a new one entirely. And it is not that reimaginings are a bad thing, do not get me wrong. TAS there I go again took Mr. Freeze from your standard icegunwielding B villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character. Of course Freeze was not exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an upgrade, but the point stands. What The Batman does is it takes everything you liked about Batman comics and lore and takes a large, smelly dump on them. Guess what? They were eating corn.It is obvious this show cannot stand against TAS but stand it on its own legs and it still does not work for me. The plots are not good and they do not develop any better. They have been written for the demographic of children under twelve. Should children be able to enjoy a show? Of course they should. This should not be an adult show with swearing, nudity, and gratuitous violence. But the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels by all ages.

This one is just not credible  too many effects, poor intrigues and so few questions. What is great about Batman is the diversity of his skills and aspects of his personality  detective, crimefighter, playboy, philanthropist etc. The Batman shows him only in his karate days.

Since when were the Joker or the Penguin ever a match for Batman ? and worse yet when were Joker and Penguin Kung Fu counterparts of Jackie Chan and Jet Li.

It was possibly the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. I cannot fathom how it ranks a rating of 5 or 6.............","label":0},{"index":6899,"txt":"I am a great fan of the Batman comics and I became disappointed when I could no longer find Batman The Animated Series on TV anymore. I was excited to learn that there was going to be a new Batman cartoon on TV. I watched the first episode the day it premiered and I was very disappointed.First of all, the animation is very poor. It looks like a cheap, crappy Japanese anime. Then again, just about every modernday cartoon is like that.The character designs are even worse. Batman looks more like Birdman, Catwoman looks more like Chihuahuawoman, Bane looks more like a red version of the Hulk, the Penguin is a KungFu master, Mr. Freeze is some undead thing with an iceberg on his head, and the Riddler is a Gothic Marilyn Manson lookalike which is funny because I do not expect people who are obsessed with riddles and puzzles to be Gothic.The worst character design is that of the Joker. They turned him into a monkeydemented Bob MarleyKungFu fighter! The Joker is supposed to be Batmans deadliest enemy, but in this show he hardly poses a threat because his crimes are so stupid and pointless. In one episode his plan was to put his Joker venom in dog food! Oh, how evil! Batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is haunted by the deaths of his parents, which is why he fights crime. This version of Batman does not seem haunted by his parents deaths and is not interesting at all. He is also not a detective, just a fighter. If there is an enemy he cannot defeat, he will not study the enemy to find out their weak points like a detective would, he will just build a giant fighting robot to defeat them. A lot of times this show does not even feel like a Batman show, just another brainless anime that is nothing but pointless fighting.What I hate the most about this show is what they did to the villains. They have taken away everything that makes them likable and relatable and turned them into stereotypical evil bad guys. ManBat is the biggest example. In the comics, he is a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness. When experimenting on himself, he accidentally transforms himself into a giant bat creature. In this show, he is a mad scientist who wants to purposely transform himself into a giant bat creature for no apparent reason. Just about all the villains are like that; none of them, with the exception of about one or two, have an actual motive for their crimes.The worst characterization is that of Mr. Freeze. In the comics, Freeze was a just a mad scientist until the genius writer Paul Dini wrote the BTAS episode Heart of Ice, which gave Freeze a new origin that made him a more tragic, threedimensional, and likable villain. The episode was so popular that fans accepted it as his actual origin and it was even used in the comics as his origin. Even that crappy movie Batman  Robin used it as his origin. In this show, he is a petty jewel thief before becoming Mr. Freeze. After becoming Mr. Freeze, guess what? He is STILL a petty jewel thief! Great origin. No wonder they used it over the one Dini created.As a Batman fan, I do not dislike this show just because it is not like the comics because I also liked BTAS, the Batman cartoons that came after it, Tim Burtons Batman films, and obviously, the superb Christopher Nolan Batman films.

I was not expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown Hollywood production, but I did however expect the artistic integrity to not interfere with the actual story even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slots.Did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing did any research go into this?.

Grendels death segment was also lacking in every way \u0096 in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script; for example Grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by Beowulf \u0096 not cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs!

The flaws of the film come from character design, character, absurd additions to the story, the visual effects, the music, and for the most part the acting.When speaking of character design, I, of course, mean the way our heroes and villains look. Beowulf and the other Danes seem like ridiculous Vikings, rather than warriors of brute strength  that helmet our main protagonist wears is just too silly. Grendel looks like the Hulk but with strange tentacleattachments to his elbows.The characters are very limited. Beowulf is same from beginning to end, however Finn  a useless sidekick  achieved some twodimensionality, due thanks to his romantic subplot, and Unferth gets some notion as well, as he becomes less conceited.Much like Finn, there are useless additions to this story to make it its own, while still holding to the source material. The crossbow that is gifted to Beowulf is so ridiculous, I am surprised the cast did not walk off the set. Besides additions, there is omissions, such as the underlying themes of Christianity and Paganism, as well as the consequences of lying.The special effects are mighty terrible. Grendel and his mother Hag are poorly conceived, and as such, they are portrayal on screen is less than believable.The music is overbearing, especially when a character dies.All in all, this is not SciFis worst film to date. No. It is actually one of the better films, though trash it still it is, it is good trash, making it a guilty pleasure at best. The only thing that works is the dialogue, which is still wooden here and there.I highly recommend you skip this film and watch Robert Zemeckis take on the ancient story of Beowulf, simply because this film Grendel is only half the tale, and not the whole thing, which garners this movie a threestar review.","label":0},{"index":6909,"txt":"Imagine you are a highschool boy, in the back of a dark, uncrowded theater with your girlfriend.

The SciFi channel has a growing catalog of inoffensive and uninteresting movies, and the previews promised an inauthentic lowbudget miniepic, but this one refused to let me switch channels. It was staggeringly, overwhelmingly, bad. I watched in fascination and horror at the train wreck you could not tear your eyes away from. I reached for a notepad and managed to capture part of what I was seeing. The following may contain spoilers or might just save your sanity. You have been warned. Just to get it over with, Beowulfs warriors wore horned helmets. Trivial issue compared to what came after. It also appears that the helmets were in a bin and handed to whichever actor wandered by next. Fit, appearance and function were apparently irrelevant. Marina Sirtis had obviously been blackmailed into doing the movie by the Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey circus. She managed to avoid a red rubber nose, but the clowns had already done the rest of her makeup. Ben Cross pretended not to be embarrassed as the king. His character, Hrothgar, must have become king of the Danes only minutes before the film opened and had not had a chance to get the crown resized to fit him yet. To facilitate the actors return to their day jobs waiting tables, none were required to change their hairstyles at all. The variety of hair included cornrows, sideburns, buzz cuts and a mullet and at least served to distract from the dialog. To prove it was a multinational cast, all were encouraged to retain whatever accent they chose. As is typical with this type of movie at least since Mad Max, leather armor was a requirement. In this case it was oddshaped, illfitting and brandnew. The female love interest, Ingrid, played by Alexis Peters, followed a longstanding tradition of hotties who should be watched with the volume turned completely down. The unintended focus of the movie was a repeating, compound crossbow with exploding bolts. It never needed to be loaded and even had a recoil when fired. It managed to shred the laws of physics, the integrity of the original legend, historical fact and plot suspense all by itself. Hrothgars palace, Heorot, rather than being a Norse long hall, apparently was designed and constructed by artisans who sank with Atlantis. Beowulf arrived at the Danes homeland in a twomasted sterncastled ship that originally was part of a set, the other two being the Santa Maria and the Pinta. Prince Unferth observed Beowulfs ships approach using a telescope. Before you could recover from that astounding innovation, you got to see the ship from his point of view. Judging from the angle, the prince was in an aircraft of some sort. Fun fact 1 In Bulgaria, fire as from a fireplace creates light without heat. This explains why you could see the actors breath whether indoors or out. Fun fact 2 Dark Age dancing in Denmark looks like slow dances I went to in the 8th grade. Fun fact 3 You, too, can make a catapult with a timedrelease airburst explosive. But, do not expect it to actually harm anything. Incidentally, Beowulf was apparently a veteran of World War II, yelling Incoming! to shred any remaining suspension of disbelief. Grendel was so upset and always in a snit because as a completely CGI creation he could not leave footprints. Even in snow. Grendels mom Hag was in a foul mood because she was a single mother and junior had not inherited her wings. Recessive gene, I suppose. By the way, we can now make an educated guess that Grendels pop was probably Swamp Thing. Grendel and mom chose to randomly kill, fly away with or drag away their prey based only on a close reading of the next few pages of the script. Fun medical fact Being slammed by a mythical beast hard enough to be thrown fifty feet against stone causes slight facial scratches that do not bleed much. The sword of legend Beowulf used to dispatch the Hag was as long as he was tall and would have contained enough steel to put a second deck on the Golden Gate Bridge. Luckily the wobbling dispelled any concerns over its weight. Best line of the movie Prince Unferth had just been impaled by Hag and spit a quart of blood roughly six feet.

When the monster did interact it looked like it was done in paintshop pro. In my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets. They may not look as fancy but at least they interact, just look at Peter Jacksons early films.As for the acting Beowulf did an descent job but the rest of the cast were either not trying or they forgot where they where.The script seemed confused to me. One minute they would be talking as if it were a modern day setting the next you get drama club Shakespeare speech. I am not say it should be all ye and that it be but you need to find a cohesive balance so the lines sound like they come from the same person.I did notice one part near the start when Beowulf was quoting the old testament which would have been find had he not spent the rest of the films talking about the gods and portents.In short, this film is a very slightly polished turd, but a turn none the less.","label":0},{"index":6922,"txt":"Just once I would like to see a version of Beowulf where it appears the screenwriters have at least a passing familiarity with the original poem. Yet again, after watching this Sci Fi presentation, I am disappointed. I am not suggesting the writers need to understand and analyze the poem in Old English, but I wish they could at least try to read a translation in modern English and attempt to construct a story based on what actually transpires. The story is exciting enough; why add plot elements that are nonexistent and ruin the story? What is wrong with being faithful to the text? Grendel is immune to weapons of any kind; why introduce some supercrossbow that is unbelievable and could not have possibly existed in this time period as correctly pointed out by the previous reviewer? The fight with Grendel was Beowulf vs. Grendel. That is it. No one else took part in the battle. The only way Beowulf could have defeated him was by choosing specifically to engage the monster without any weapons, the mistake made by all previous challengers. Yet, in this version, Danes and Geats fight the beast and Beowulf hacks off Grendels arm with a sword! Again, why could not they portray what really happened? Personally, I think a oneonone grappling match between the two would be much more exciting. Overall, this is a pathetic and abysmal depiction that is faithless to the true tale. Why add in a pact with Hrothgar and Grendels mother that includes sacrificial offering? Why create extra characters, like Finn, that add nothing to the story? There was no love story in the poem. They could not even set the scenes in the appropriate locations a forest instead of the swamp and no lair under the lake. They fail to notice the metaphor that Grendels lair signifies \u0096 it is supposed to be underground to represent hell. Why not instead center on the symbolism inherent in the epic poem? Even my high school students last year were able to do immensely better when they created a short film based on Beowulf, since they focused on the themes and symbolism underlying the story. If Hollywood could create a film that centers on these elements and is faithful to the plot, then that would be a truly great movie.","label":0},{"index":6923,"txt":"Where to begin? Anachronism?

Possibly the blond who would fit in on a recent fashion show with her makeup and streaked hair? The ancient Danish court represented in Classical Greek style? The queen played by Marina Sirtis more savaged by her makeup artist than by madness? The effects are way too weak to carry this story. There are some stories that do not mind or even benefit from cheap effects, but this Grendel is not one of them. What about characters who seem to jump about in their attitudes without motivation? A bravado idiot prince whose home has already been savaged more than once by the monster Grendel seems to have less respect for the danger he faces than Beowulf who was sent from afar from the land of the Geats to help the desperate Danes. In this it feels more like an old cowboy western than any kind of myth.Beowulf is an ancient tale from an era with almost no literary tradition and much of both its sentiment and its drama is obscure. I suspect that any modern telling which does not make an intelligent attempt to penetrate the obscurity must fail. I did not love the recent Beowulf and Grendel which sees Grendel essentially as human and sees Hrothgar and his Danes as too arrogant and stupid to recognize Grendels attacks as welljustified vengeance, but I had to respect its revisionist position that Hrothgars Danes were a bunch of macho thugs who never grasped, even after it was all over, that they had brought this nightmare on themselves, and therefore, the original story of Beowulf, as it was written, was a misrepresentation of the real story. I think there is a more complex meaning to be understood than that, but this Grendels terrible secret that Grendels attacks are tied to previous human sacrifice does not really bring us closer to the shame experienced by Hrothgar and the Danes. This Beowulf has little to recommend it as traditional myth or as modern fantasy. I give it a 4 higher than it deserves, but always hopeful that a poor effort will draw attention by someone who is up to telling the story intelligently.

Its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it. What really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny. The actress replacing Jean Renos descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married. Nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it is a waste of perfectly good film. The torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions. This second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well. This film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a necklace. No script since it was apparently written and added to daily. No attention to camera or shots in mind. Poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so. This film would not even pass for a student film in basic Film 101. How this pile got through no one can tell. It was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries. This movie has one good part ...its END!

But it fails at making them laugh...Les Visiteurs has had its success, because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel  forget about Zemeckiss Back to the future, here comes the old France, the middleage knight and its nearly barbaric way of life. Full of pride, funny thanks to the ancient words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor. Then comes the sequel.Nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of Les Visiteurs, the first. And it is no use being a movie expert to realize that the Corridors of Time has been made for money.The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs, and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed some second tought. Explanation  it is no use trying to get back the jewelry Jacquouille has stolen ; do not you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode ? Where do you think he found the money ? Selling the jewelry... And that is only one of many holes Poir\u00e9 tries to avoid... and fails.Let us have a look at the characters  Montmirail does not change, he is just a little more boring. Regarding Frenegonde... that is another story  Val\u00e9rie Lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so pitiful I nearly felt pain for her. And Poir\u00e9 does not realize that a cast of humorists is not enough to make a good comedy.Forget about the time travels, about the digital effects, concentrate on the story and you will see that there is enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times.The main interest of this film is the landscapes.

I like Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and of course plain absurdness, that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes.Now this sequel has the same characters, the same actors in great part and the same time traveling. The plot changes a little, since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers. So they jump up and down in history, without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie. The duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing, but his character has been emptied, so there is not a lot he can do to save the film.Now the dukes slavehelper, he has really all the attention. The movie is merely about him and his being clumsy  annoying  stupid or whatever he was supposed to be. Fact is; this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience, but he does not succeed. It is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke, you already know, but he insists on telling that joke till the end, adding details, to make your suffering a little longer.If you liked Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel.

At least they used toothbrushes...at least they had wallpaper.There are no bloodsuckers for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances, not one.

At first Evelyn is reluctant but is persuaded when it is agreed stage hand Samuel Leo Valeriano goes along as well. Once there Count Marnack tells his guests that his Father  Grandfather both cut the heads off their cheating wives using a ceremonial knife  there is a feeling of unease when it turns out that Evelyn looks EXACTLY the same as the current Counts wife who ran away not too long ago... Along with having to worry about weirdo servants it turns out that someone wants to use the knife themselves to chop a few heads off...This Italian production was written  directed by Alfredo Rizzo  is total, complete  utter crap from start to finish. First things first lets start the criticism with the title The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance, lets examine that title because when I do I feel somewhat cheated that there are not any Vampires or any form of bloodsucking whatsoever, noone leads anything at anytime  there most certainly is not any dance or dancing so do not expect any of these things. What you should expect though is a tedious, dull, boring pointless little giallo that takes over an hour before anyone is killed  any sort of murder mystery starts to take shape, the first hour of La Sanguisuga Conduce la Danza is as plot less  uninteresting as anything out there. The best way to imagine it is to think of the most boring softcore porn film you have ever seen, then cut most of the softcore porn out  that just leaves bad actors, bad dubbing, bad dialogue, a tiny bit of softcore sex  lesbianism  absolutely nothing else. Yep, it really is that bad. The mystery elements are crap, people do illogical things for no apparent reason  the overly complicated twist ending is as bad as the rest of it, The Sixth Sense 1999 this as not!Director Rozzi does an OK job  La Sanguisga Conduce la Danza actually has a nice look  feel to it despite it is obvious low budget, I mean there are scenes where he shows a storm raging outside the castle however the stock footage used is in black  white! So the film jumps from bright colour to black  white whenever it cuts to the storm  back to colour again! There is one absolutely hilarious scene where a maid  her friend discuss her breasts  she lets her friend feel them who is then full of compliments, this scene is so funny  just so unnatural that it is priceless  easily the films best moment even if a bad 70s porno would be embarrassed by the dialogue! There is minimal nudity  the sexlesbian scenes are very tame. Forget about any blood or gore as there is not any apart from a decapitated head.Technically the films pretty good, the period setting  production design are actually quite impressive although it is not massive in scope it does the job effectively enough. The film has a nice sense of colour  the cinematography is fine. The film is dubbed so it is hard to give an opinion on the original performances but the voice actors are terrible  the dialogue is even worse than usual.La Sanguisuga Conduce la Danza is a terrible film, it makes no sense, it has virtually no story for over an hour, it has possibly the most misleading title ever  is really dull  boring with a confused stupid twist ending. As far as Euro horror fans go there are plenty of much better films than this so please do not waste your time, as for anyone else this is definitely one to avoid. Trivia Note the notorious  banned in the UK Nazi exploitationhorror film Horrifying Experiments of the S.S Last Days 1977 AKA SS Hell Camp  The Beast in Heat was directed by Luigi Batzella  he has a fairly substantial role as a police detective in La Sanguisuga Conduce la Danza.","label":0},{"index":6967,"txt":"This is the most messed up entry on IMDb that I have yet to stumble across.

Now unless your audience is made of total idiots, it becomes painfully obvious that this was doneand done with little finesse or care about the final product. The bottom line is that you have a lot of clearly Japanese scenes and then clearly American scenes where the film looks quite different. Plus, the American scenes really are meaningless and consist of two different groups of people at meetings just talking about Gamerathe evil flying turtle! And although this is a firebreathing, flying and destructive monster, there is practically no energy because I assume the actors were just embarrassed by being in this wretched filmin particular, film veterans Brian Donlevy and Albert Dekker. They both just looked tired and illatease for being there.Now as for the monster, it is not quite the standard Godzillalike creature. Seeing a giant fanged turtle retract his head and limbs and begin spinning through the air like a missile is hilarious. On the other hand, the crappy model planes, destructible balsa buildings and power plant are, as usual, in this film and come as no surprise. Plus an odd Japanese monster movie clich\u00e9 is included that will frankly annoy most nonJapanese audience members, and that is the adorable and precocious little boy who loves the monster and believes in him. Yeah, right. Well, just like in GODZILLA VERSUS THE SMOG MONSTER and several other films, you have got this annoying creep cheering on the monster, though unlike later incarnations of Godzilla, Gamera is NOT a good guy and it turns out in the end the kid is just an idiot! Silly, exceptional poor special effects that could be done better by the average seven yearold, bad acting, meaningless American clips and occasionally horrid voice dubbing make this a wretched film. Oddly, while most will surely hate this film and that stupid kid, there is a small and very vocal minority that love these films and compare them to Bergman and Kurosawa. Do not believe themthis IS a terrible film!FYIApparently due to his terrific stage presence, Gamera was featured in several more films in the 60s as well as some recent incarnations.

That seems to be Gammera in a nutshell, a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon. I am not a fan of Japanese monster films, but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film DVD scifi collection put out by Mill CreekTreeline Films. It is a great value at about twenty five bucks, so at fifty cents per movie, it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offerings.Gammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast, and he is not happy. Like Godzilla, he takes it out on Tokyo, setting the United Nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet. They arrive at Plan Z, the hope of the world, and would not you know it, there is a scene where a huge shed is shown that is called the Z Plan building; that was a nice touch.By the mid 1960s, this country still was not quite politically correct. One of the American military scenes at the Alaskan Air Defense Sector has General Arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee. I guess there were not any privates around.Good old Gammera was quite the sight though, walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged. That is why it surprised me how Plan Z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship, whisking him off to Mars to save the world. High fives all around for the American and Russian team that made the save, now let us get back to the Cold War.Like Godzilla, Gammera spawned at least a good dozen films, but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying, flaming turtles. Especially since that DVD pack I mentioned earlier has Attack of the Monsters with a featured guest appearance by the Big G. It took all I had to make it through to the end of both films; it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said Gammera, Sayonara!","label":0},{"index":6974,"txt":"We now travel to a parallel universe where the appearance of giant prehistoric monsters flattening cities are part of the daily routine. It is the world of Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra Ghidrah and their kind  a strange world, and one made even stranger by the appearance of an unidentified flying turtle called Gamera.Forever in the shadow of the monolithic Toho Studios, second rung Daiei Studios were more famous for samurai sagas than monster movies. In the mid 60s they decided to join the giant reptile race and designed a rival monster series to Tohos mammothly successful Godzilla. They wisely chose Gamera as their flagship  a giant turtle that shoots flames from between its snaggleteeth, and spins through the air by shooting flames through its shells feetholes and at one point you almost see the paper mache shell catch fire!.The first Gamera film Gamera The Invincible as it was sold to the US is a virtual mirror of the first Godzilla film, only 10 years behind. American fighters chase an unmarked plane over the Arctic to its fiery demise  the nuclear bomb on board ignites and awakens the giant Gamera from its icy slumber. Feeding off atomic energy, it immediately goes on a rampage, and the world wants to destroy Gamera once and for all, but a little Japanese boy named Kenny, who has a psychic connection with the giant turtle and even keeps a miniature version in an aquarium by his bedside, believes Gamera is essentially kind and benevolent. He is like a little Jewish kid with a pinup of Hitler. Gamera is a GOOD turtle, he pleads, then sulks, and puts on a face like someones pooped in his coco pops. Miraculously the worlds leaders listen to him, and so begins ZPlan to save the world AND Gamera from complete destruction.Released in 1965, Gamera was a surprising hit. The annoying infantile anthropomorphism actually worked on kiddie audiences in both Japan and the US, and the sight of Gamera on two feet stomping miniatures of Tokyo and the North Pole is gloriously chintzy. Most surprising of all is the longevity of the series eight original Gamera films, plus a slew of recent remakes. Not bad for a mutant reptile whose only friend is mewing eight year old milquetoast  and if I hear Gamera is friends to ALL children one more time I am going to crush Tokyo. Which appears to be an easy task in the parallel universe where children are smart and turtles are bigger than a Seiko billboard in the 1965 turtlefest Gamera.","label":0},{"index":6975,"txt":"With the rising popularity of the now iconic Godzilla series, like with any hit cinema event, there was inevitably going to be a crowd of imitators trying to cash in on the success on the big lizard. With Godzilla came the dawn of a rising popularity of the kaiju giant monster genre. Many sought after success; a few gained it. One of the few that not only profited, but garnered popularity was Gamera, a giant turtle that could breathe fire in and out and fly by spewing flames from the sockets in his carapace as a means of jet propulsion. But unlike Godzilla, Gamera was marketed as a friend to all children, later fighting other monsters to save kids in peril, and thus Gamera became very popular amongst the kiddies. Unfortunately, that is about the only audience mainstream that the original Gamera series will have any appeal to. While the new Gamera movies directed by Shusuke Kaneko are marvelous, revolutionary monster movies, the original series, including the original, is nothing special.The first Gamera movie, titled in Japan as The Giant Monster Gamera was clearly a Godzilla wanttobe. Even though the movie was produced in the era of color films, it was shot in blackandwhite. Why? To imitate the first Godzilla movie from the 1950s. Gamera also attacks Tokyo. Because Godzilla attacked Tokyo in the first movie. I do not know much about the Japanese version, for the version I am familiar with the Americanized version, where scenes were cut and new footage with American actors were inserted is it coincidence that the same thing happened with the first Godzilla film? Now whether this adds or takes away from the film, I cannot say. But Gammera the Invincible is really nothing more than a ponderous bore that just plods along like the big turtle himself.Gammera the Invincible is a very routineorientated movie. The characters are from a stock of sciencefiction standards, the story is inane, the monster has no real motive for attacking civilization, the acting is laughable, and so on and so forth. The only thing that differentiates it from the Godzilla series is the ending of the movie, but that is also a detractor since the plan that eventually halts Gameras rampage is completely phony and ridiculous. Now the rest of the movie and many other entries in this genre also fit that description, but this is a direfully stodgy monster movie.And although Shusuke Kaneko would later transform Gamera into an interesting monster with his trilogy in the 1990s, in the original series, Gamera was not an attractive screen presence. He was neither scary nor sympathetic. He just waddles around like a toddler, swaying with each step, and knocks miniature sets over. As usual, everybody wants to destroy Gamera except for a little kid Yoshio Uchida who was lazily left out of the credits though he plays a central role who thinks Gamera is a nice turtle.Most movies in the genre that Gammera the Invincible is a part of are easy targets for criticism and this one is subject to extra pressure. Even in the company of many other Godzillaimitators, this Gamera film is not a particularly good entry. And as far as my cinema experience goes, the rest of the movies in the series are either just as boring or worse. Like Godzilla, Gamera would be filmed in color and go on to fight monsters. And like Godzilla, he would get cheaper and cheaper with every film until it was time to revive the series and make him serious again.It is peculiar. Usually I recommend people to stick with the originals and pass on the remakes. But in the case of Gamera, my verdict is just the opposite. I strongly encourage people to watch the 1990s Gamera trilogy directed by Shusuke Kaneko and to skip over the original series unless interested. The new films are inventive, wellmade, exciting, and above all, fun. The original series is a long stream of boredom.","label":0},{"index":6976,"txt":"After the atomic bombs carried by a shotdown Soviet bomber explode in the Arctic, the creature Gammera is released from his hibernation.

This version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla Godzilla King of the Monsters, Gammera the Invincible gets more than just the spelling wrong. The American scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great Gojira, but do not really add much to the story either because there is little follow up on them. The film starts off promising, there are a few scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot.

The directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time all miniatures. Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good.

Particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of How are you? I am fine. Are you sure? Yes. Wow! What depth of character. I guess the incessant cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for them.As a huge fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I was totally disappointed in this. Even Zhangs sentimentally sappy The Road Home was better than this.","label":0},{"index":6990,"txt":"Ye Lous film Purple Butterfly pits a secret organization Purple Butterfly against the Japanese forces in war torn Shanghai. Ding Hui Zhang Ziyi and her exlover Hidehiko Itami Toru Nakamura find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting.I agree with the reviewer from Paris. The film substitutes a convoluted, semihistorical conflict for a plot, without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes. The sudden time shifting does not help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless. Normally I do not mind dark movies, but the absence of light, the bonejarringly shaky camera footage, and the generally bad filmmaking techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in. I also agree with the viewer from Georgia that this film has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography, but I do not think that helps the movie. The backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th Century, and I do not believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a Michael Bay film. The overly melodramatic moments do not add to its watchability.The actors are all suitably melancholy. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films, brooding and looking generally annoyed. However, at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst lovemaking scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator.All in all, a very disappointing film, especially seeing as how it comes from the director of Suzhou He. 210","label":0},{"index":6991,"txt":"The main complaint with this film is the fact that I CAN NOT tell who is who. No racism intended, but these Asians look all the same! I can tell somewhat of the story, but heck thats about as far as it goes. The peoples identities are not a mystery, if they were a mystery I would care about them. Instead I was not them off the screen ASAP.Tons of wide shots and silent emotionless faces occupy this movie. Heck is it boring, not only do I not know these people, but they are just sitting there.The production is typical Chinese John Woo, terrible video with blotched scenes. This looks only slightly better than Andy Laus Fulltime Killer Which was a great movie. You would think with a decent budget they could at least make it look like 90s Hollywood. I did not know the Chinese had these arthouse beatniks.","label":0},{"index":6992,"txt":"I am a huge Ziyi Zhang fan and will go to any film to see her which is what took me to Purple Butterfly. As much as I wanted to like this movie, I have to agree with many others who have commented on it. It is very confusing and also extremely slow. Because all of the film appears to have been shot with a hand held camera, significant portions of it are out of focus. The film has very little dialog and what there is does not tell you much. There are endless scenes of people just standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room staring at each other with no conversation. The way the film time shifts is also very confusing and hard to follow. Even having read a number of reviews beforehand and having a general idea what the film was about, I still had a difficult time understanding what was going on. I knew beforehand that the movie was not remotely similar to previous Ziyi Zhang starring films but was looking forward to seeing her in something different but unfortunately I was ultimately disappointed. She never smiles in this film although admittedly most of the time she does not have anything to smile about. I could have done without the sex scenes as they were about as sexless and without any obvious feeling between the participants as you could hope to find.","label":0},{"index":6993,"txt":"I was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the New York Times. In addition, I am also Shanghainese so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject matter. However, after watching it, I was extremely disappointed.The movies pace was excruciatingly slow and monotonous. The director lingered on certain scenes for much too long. There was no passion or chemistry between the lovers. There was barely any dialogue. Dialogue was sorely needed to compensate for the lack of acting. At the end of the movie, you did not feel any compassion for the characters. This movie was lacking in everything. The script was weak, the acting was poor, and the editing was nonexistent. The director tried to emulate certain noir film styles but failed miserably. A good movie is one in which captures your attention, maintains it and is successful in concluding without you feeling time has passed by. This movie felt as though it would never end. Do not waste your money on this movie.","label":0},{"index":6994,"txt":"Claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the movie Too long face only shots where you most of the time get the feeling that the lower half of the film is missing that the screen is cut off, because there seems to be important actions going on, but you cannot see them. There is anyway already too much confusion in the movie, so these viewing angles make it worse and do not contribute to artful visuals. I like artfully made movies and unconventional camera work. I can handle deep and slow movies. But this one is trying too hard to be something artful and fails in my opinion painfully.Nothing to get attached to, to any of the characters, because they are not worked out well enough. To work out characters more is needed, than just minute long face shots, at least with this set of scriptdirectoractors.I wonder whether some of the not so good acting is due to the script and director or due to the actors. I will stay away from films both written and directed by Le You for sure in the future. What an annoying film even for someone who would be interested in that part of history, and for someone who spent time in Shanghai.","label":0},{"index":6995,"txt":"Lethargic direction ruins an otherwise compelling period story that stars the wondrous Zhang Ziyi, in an excellent role as a woman who joins an extremist group in 1928 China, just prior to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and reunites with a former lover who is now working for Japan. Every bit of drama and forward motion of the story is sucked dry by director Ye Lous somnambulist directorial style. Characters stand still staring at each other for long minutes, saying nothing, handheld cameras hold forever on faces showing interminable reactions way longer than they need to, edits repeat the same reaction is triple redundancy. We know nothing about the characters as the story begins and are given little new information as the story progresses, only silence and static shots of lovers who do not speak, who interaction through silent dances but share no apparent emotional intimacy. A very sleep inducing film.","label":0},{"index":6996,"txt":"I was not really going to comment, but then I figured I had something to say. I saw this film two days ago and, although I think it is not a complete waste of time it might have been of money though, for the producers, it is obvious it has serious problems. It is got really good cinematography and little but nice music. A lot has been said about Ana Cristina Oliveira but, let us be honest, over what? She is not really an actress an she balances permanently between overacting and preposterous underacting. Her performance passes for good because there has never been anyone like Odete in any other film crazy? sad? childlike? an impostor? no one knows, fellows. So she is kinda sorta dictating the rules here.I thought this film was also a good example of the problem most Portuguese films suffer from soundtrack. There is a permanent NO to dubbing and the result is this usual mass of noise that comes out of the blue. People in other countries may think Portugal is the noisiest of places. What thrilled me though, was that some of the dialog was dubbed but it did not necessarily solve the syndrome. Bad dubbing too, I must say. It is strange to watch a film in which the first thing that strikes my mind on the first scene, when the first character speaks is it is dubbed. And all this to say that the film has technical problems.It also has script problems. It tries to be classical from the first to the last scene. There was a desperate fear of leaving things suspended and that shows. The writer was obviously trying to get everything straight and he does but... it shows!! All dialog is too expositive and there is not one single piece of talk that sounds like a line from a film. It is all a little raw and slightly unpleasant.Not that the film is a total mess, I must stress. I just think the good parts are so obvious that I prefer to concentrate on the bad ones.Direction brings little to the weak screenplay. All shots are classical and uninnovative, but their beautiful. Great work from Rui Po\u00e7as, by the way.Now, what I think was THE problem, the one that keeps people from believing this story and laugh throughout the film instead of taking it seriously The guy who plays the guy who DIES is obviously not an actor. Actually, It is a rather important role and I cannot see why nonactors are cast for such parts. This guy is neither an actor nor a goodlooking man. Which means the whole film rolls down the mountain, since we never believe for one second that this gorgeous woman is obsessed with him even though he is gone, and that his hunky lover who survives is actually having a bad time getting over the loss, when all we see of this character is apathy. Too bad. The world is full of beautiful people who even happen to be nice seductive lovers. The world is full of good actors who are also cute boys and capable of causing obsessions on people after theys gone. The world is full of great films and also of not that great films. Cest la vie!","label":0},{"index":6997,"txt":"I tried. I really did. I thought that maybe, if I gave Joao Pedro Rodrigues another chance, I could enjoy his movie. I know that after seeing O FANTASMA I felt ill and nearly disgusted to the core, but some of the reviews were quite good and in favor, so I was like, What the hell. At least you did not pay 10 dollars at the Quad. Give it a shot.Sometimes it is better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without any previous anesthetic to alleviate the horror of so much pain. I often wonder if it would not be better to go back to my childhood and demand my former bullies to really let me have it. On other occasions, I often think that the world is really flat and that if I sail away far enough, I will not only get away from it all, but fall clear over, and that some evil, Lovecraftian thing will snatch me with its 9000 tentacles and squeeze the life  and some french fries from 1995, still lingering inside my esophagus  out of me.Is there a reason for Odete? I would say not at all... just that maybe her Creator thought that writing a story centered on her madness one that makes Alex Forrest look like Strawberry Shortcake look not only creepy, but flatout sick to the bone. She first of all decides to leave her present boyfriend in shrieking hysterics because she wants a child and he believes they are too young. She later crashes a funeral of a gay man, and  get this  in order to get closer to him, she feigns being pregnant while insinuating herself into the lives of the dead mans mother and lover in the sickest of ways. Oh, of course, she shrieks like a banshee and throws herself not one, but a good three times on his grave. And there is this ridiculous business that she progressively becomes Pedro which sums up some weakasbadtea explanation that love knows no gender. Or something.I would say she is as nuts as a can of cashews, unsalted. But then again, so as the director. And me, for taking a chance on this. At least the men look good. Other than that... not much else to see here.","label":0},{"index":6998,"txt":"A group of us watched this film are were really disgusted. We were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character Jo was not on it is not like the writersproducers could do anything about that. The writing was poor, the script was subpar. What REALLY annoyed us 1. When the two guys realized they were both dating Natalie, they did not just leave they put up with that stupid and ultimately degrading contest  but only because they were macho competing guys, not because they really wanted Natalie. 2. Despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the reunion, Natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him? and there was no foreshadowing that he was really a better guy, it is as if the writers flipped a coin and then just had her spit it out at some convenient point in the film. 3. Blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want children and then all of a sudden when her husband says he wants to have children, she blissfully agrees with him.","label":0},{"index":6999,"txt":"A particularly maligned example of Italian cult cinema with a nonsensical title to boot if anything, the alternate THE MARK OF Satan is even less relevant to the plot!, this hybrid of Gothic Horror and Giallo with a strong dose of Erotica only contrives a flat sort of atmosphere throughout \u0096 actually matched by handling which is downright dreadful! Here, we get the usual group of people an acting troupe stranded on an island to which they were invited by a Count \u0096 since he had become enamored of the leading lady, a deadringer for his missing spouse! The characters are pretty much stereotypes middleaged but dashing hero played by Giacomo RossiStuart and whose family history bears more than its share of violent tragedy, demure heroine, sluttish companion recalling Mae West and emerging the most annoying of the lot!, a meek but devoted stage manager forever chided by one and all for his unmanly behavior!, a couple of lesbians, a mysterious gardener the ubiquitous Luciano Pigozzi who, for once, gets in on the action, if you know what I mean, an envious housekeeper nominal star Femi Benussi though, for what it is worth, this is really an ensemble piece, a religious fanatic of a butler, an impressionable chambermaid, etc. While the film is not by any means unwatchable, the atrocious dubbing, snails pace, shoddy production with the scenes depicting the raging sea lifted from some blackandwhite film! and the fact that the murders only occur within the concluding halfhour do not help matters. Besides, Marcello Giombinis score, though pleasant in itself, comes off as incongruously modern under the circumstances; that said, the revelation proves a surprisingly elaborate one considering there is surely no shortage of suspects here.","label":0}]}
