Dinocroc is a good movie in general but unfortunately it is still an obvious bmovie. The Dinocroc itself looked great but i thought the movie itself needed a little bit more weight as in action and violence because whenever the croc is shown or is in a fight scene not very much goes on except the croc is shown and the croc either kills or runs off in a repeated process. Jane Longenecker was hot which is a plus and the acting was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the croc looked fleshy instead of like a cartoon coughs curse of the komodocoughs.

First of all the movie is starring Lizzy McGuires brother as the annoying little kid that goes looking for his lost 3 legged dog. Now please what kind of dumb ass mistakes a threelegged dog for a god damn mutated crocodile please I ask you? And heres another point for pondering, why do they show the Dinocroc on the back of the movie box being enormous and actually in the water? I believe if memory serves the thing spent about 2.6 minutes in the water and was just shy of 6 feet tall, that was a heart breaker. But redeeming qualities to this movie were that it was so bad that i almost died laughing because believe me the bad acting made me wish for death. But the fact remains that once again this thing is created by another military testing site to train super crocodiles for military combat or something like that from the source of all things evil E.V.I.L Corporation. And let us not forget the characters let us see we have jerk off 1 as the male lead and half way decent chick who does not know how to act as the female lead to that I say WOW! The only thing worse then the acting was the end of course the heroes spend about what seems like 2 hours talking and planning some long elaborate way of killing the dinocroc only to have it fail and kill it in an ordinary way that could have taken about 15 seconds to come up with. All in all this movie was beyond gay with its random opera music in the background and the fact that it was probably the gayest of all CGI monsters ever made along with the fact it of course was impervious to bullets and bombs otherwise it would not have been made for the military DUH!. By far the best scene was when Lizzy McGuires brother runs into the shack and the dinocroc eats him causing his head to pop clean off with a popping noise i might add. I believe that you would be better off shooting yourself between the eyes then to watch Dinocroc. And as for the director I believe that we should get a bunch of people to hang him by a noose and all take turns kicking him in the crotch for wasting an hour and a half of our lives until he finally dies and then I can go on living.","label":0},{"index":11007,"txt":"A large part of the scenes should be cut off. There is a lot of scenes that should have been cut off. For example the scene where the hunters mentions I got spiders on my dick, I like dick, playing in the mud scene, or a bar scene where a professional dinocroc hunters main job is a snake charmer.How about other terribly incoherent scenes featuring a woman, Diane who wants to loose her virginity to a boyfriend who walks like he wears womens panties three sizes too small. While they make love, did not they realized they are making it out next to the little boy who will soon run away and loose his head? Why did they do in a living room? I mean his head really flipped. How about the beach scene very reminiscent of Steven Spielbergs Jaws scene at Grant Lake. All these strange scene could easily be redubbed and billed as a comedy.Here in my local town, the cineplex theaters had been advertising for months about Dinocroc, and I am glad I did not watch it because I later found out it was shown only for 1 or 2 days before it was canceled. The movie was THAT bad. I suspected that Dinocroc was not a good movie looking at the preview. It features the leg of Dinocroc that looks like a child wearing green pajamas and slippers with claws and walks up and down like a 2 year old. It could easily passed over as Baby Geniuses.If any students of movie making wants to learn what not to do this is a real classic trash. Such as Dianes boyfriend who walks like he had an advanced case of syphilis makes you wonder what the poor woman sees in this guy who looks drunk even before he get to drink beer. When this happens, who cares about Dinocroc? The panties man looked more more interesting than the entire movie of Dinocroc. His acting was so bad, he makes a much better replacement for Mr. Bean.

Of course, this skill will come in mighty handy when our heroes set up a created trap for the croc, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide.The croc itself is never the least bit convincing as it rampages through a reserve looking for food, the special effects of a low grade variety. In regards to Roger Corman productions dealing with renegade dinomonsters, I stick with Carnosaur. The monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on it is hind legs, often upright as it pursues potential victims. I felt Mandylor and the filmmakers were spoofing Crocodile Dundee with his croc hunter, and this imitation might amuse where the monster itself fails.

We only get a few glimpses of the huge twolegged dinosaur descendant and some of the best kill scenes in a small budget film.My favorite scene is of a moronic character trying to use a three legged dog for bait and becomes croc food himself. Nothing left on the pier but ankle top feet. With no real stand out roles Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier.

It has a quasiTen Little Indians scenario, but ditches it midway through in favor of spotlighting Sally Field and her uncovering of a killer. Field overacts here with a gracelessness I have seldom seen from her. The early introductions are good, but the writing quickly strays offcourse and eventually goes over the top. Lots of hysteria, and constant thunder and lightning effects which adds nothing. A curious failure from producers Aaron Spelling  Leonard Goldberg.

My comments will be based purely on the film. As soon as I saw the trailer I knew I had to see it and was so excited but when I finally did, I was so disappointed it hurt. This is because the movie itself felt so amateurish. The actors were not well cast though Robards and Pryce are both good actors  just not here. The kid actors, it seemed, were merely asked to show up, get in the characters clothes, say the lines and make the faces. The set and props were cheap and unrealistic. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised at the awfulness of it that I had to go online and check who directed it, just to see the kind of work he had done. The editing was cut and paste and the plot screenplay was just that as well even though the author had been involved himself, irony?. The building up of the tension, fear and suspense was so mild it was ineffective when the climax finally came.I have read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it. What hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing. It had so much potential. Unfortunately, the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the story.","label":0},{"index":11019,"txt":"First and foremost, I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury. It is the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later. It was one of his best books, with, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I as just hoping that this movie would be all right. It had lots of chances, with a great cast, like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the script himself. And on top of all that, it has PAM GRIER!How could it fail?There may be spoilers within.First of all, it was dumbed down. Much of the horror from the book was lost as Bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum. All the visuals from the book...gone. Everything that made you squirm...gone.And then there is the acting. Like a lot of movies that Disney threw out in the 80s, the kids in this movie cannot act. And, this bugged me a lot, neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship was not addressed. It was more like they were acquaintaces. You would think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could pull this off in their roles of Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark. But here it is like they just do not care. All they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something. This is far from being some of their best performances. Pam Grier was fine as the witch, but the charecter of the Dust Witch herself was not well pulled off. She is a lot less evil and does not have the presence as she did in the book. And everything that was left out of the book. The ballon night chase, the marking of Jims house, the real death of Mr. Dark, what happened to Mr. Coogan on the merrygoround, the fate of the lightening rod salesman, the real death of the witch, and oh so much more. And the special effects were bad, even for the 80s. The merrygoround of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around was not really creepy, and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything. I could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel, but it makes blood boil. Do not see this movie but read the book. It is a classic of Bradbury.","label":0},{"index":11020,"txt":"Plan B is strictly bythenumbers fare except for one thing. I surprisingly found it to be rather insulting.Jon Cryer is the star of this film and plays his usual, smarmy, egotistical, snotty character that was actually endearing in Pretty In Pink and has NOT been amusing ever since. Grating does not even begin to describe his performance. Ricky Mark Matheisen is a muscular, blonde, struggling actor who gasp! is only worried about his hair and getting laid. Talk about a stock character...ugh. At least the other three characters are somewhat engaging. Lisa Darr and Lance Guest play a grounded, optimistic, caring couple who are struggling to conceive. Since they are not whiny drama queens, however, their roles are apparently considered boring and they are not given enough screen time. Sara Mornell rounds out the cast by playing Gina, your usual nice and goodlooking young woman who just cannot seem to find the right partner in love. I have seen this character a million times before but at least her performance overcomes some of the shortfalls caused by the predictability of her situation.What startled me about this film was its juvenile promotion of stereotypes. They introduced a Russian character for the sole purpose of mocking him and making fun of the way he talked. He was portrayed as being wild, ignorant and amazingly shallow. They were just getting warmed up though for the usual nonsense about gays. Gina decides to be gay for a while since she is not having any luck with guys. Honestly. That was not that bad except they really went overboard when Gina brought a lesbian to a Christmas party her friends were throwing. Her lesbian date had very short hair like I am sure all lesbians do. She also got quite upset like I am sure all lesbians do when Gina had the nerve to put on lipstick!. Finally, her date goes around the party hitting on just about every woman there and mouths off when Gina expresses her disappointment. Of course, we all know how gay people cannot stay faithful for so much as a couple of hours much less months or even years, right? Please note the sarcasm in that statement. Thank you.This film was based on a tired and predictable premise to begin with but Cryers unlikable performance combined with the idiotic stereotyping sinks this movie to the lower depths of cinema. 210","label":0},{"index":11021,"txt":"Imagine that in adapting a James Bond novel into a movie, the filmmakers eliminated all the action and suspense in order to make it kidfriendly. Or if a television producer told Chris Rock he could not cuss so that his specials could be rated PG. In the same way, the director of the movie Something Wicked This Way Comes took out the excitement and gore in favor of melodrama for younger audiences. This created a monotonous plot without the complications of the book. In trying to make the story of Something Wicked This Way Comes easier for children to follow, the filmmakers eliminated the theme of good and evil both existing in everyone, and good always prevailing over evil. This is apparent in Wills character transformation, Charles Halloways rescue of Jim, and the carnivals defeat.Wills transformation into a more adventurous boy has been muted in the movie. The scene in which the Dust Witch visits Wills house in a balloon has been cut from the film. Instead, a green mist follows Jim and Will home and gives them the same bad dream about the Witch and her spiders. The balloon attack shows us that Will has begun to conquer his fear of doing things on his own. He gets on top of a neighbors roof and tears the balloon with a bow, defeating the Witch. Sorry, Dad, he thought, and sat up, smiling. This time it is me out, alone, Will decides as he prepares to face her 147. Removing this scene from the movie prevents us from understanding that Will is becoming more adventuresome. The film shows us many examples of Will being afraid to follow Jim, but never growing curious like his friend. In the book, Will has both a good, quiet side and an evil, daring side like his Jim. In the movie, each boy only has one mode of thought, which destroys Bradburys theme of both good and evil being present in each person.In the book, Will saves Jim because of their friendship, but, in the movie, Charles Halloway saves Jim to repay Jims father. Will pulls Jim off the carousel in Bradburys novel because he does not want his best friend to grow up without him. It is the good in Will, the fact that he cares about his friend, that saves Jim from the evil curse of the carnival. On the carousel, Jim gestured his other hand free to trail on the wind, the one part of him, the small, white, separate part that still remembered their friendship 269. This shows that there was good left inside of Jim, which has the potential to still defeat evil. But when Charles Halloway saves Jim in the movie, he does it to repay the debt he owes Jims father, who saved Will when he was a little boy. By changing the motivation for saving Jim, the filmmakers have ruined Bradburys original idea that it takes good to win against evil.In the end of the movie, the carnival is defeated by a tornado and lightning instead of smiles and laughter. When the book ends, Mr. Dark turns himself into a little boy and Charles Halloway smiles and laughs at him so much that he cannot stand it and evaporates. In Bradburys world, evil people feed off fear and can only be defeated by happiness and love. His message is that good will always prevail over evil, but only if that goodness is expressed outwardly. Good to evil seems evil, says Charles Halloway as he holds the dying Mr. Dark. So I will do only good to you, Jed. I will simply hold you and watch you poison yourself 275. In the movie, Mr. Dark is the only one left on the carousel when lightning hits it, and he dies. By eliminating the weapon of laughter and smiles, the filmmakers imply that bad weather is the most effective way to defeat evil, as if lightning only strikes those who are bad. This takes away the major theme of Bradburys book, which is that doing good toward others wards off evil.Good may always triumph over evil, but trying to make movies more kidfriendly will always force filmmakers to leave out some of the themes from the books they are based on. In the movie, Something Wicked This Way Comes, Will does not transform, Wills friendship does not save Jim, and smiles and laughter do not defeat the carnival. As a result, the filmmakers have left out too many of Bradburys main points. The process of adapting a book to a movie too often ruins the world the author has established. In the case of this story, Bradburys frightening world of opposing forces of good and evil has been reduced to a tamer, simpler version of itself.","label":0},{"index":11022,"txt":"I watched this movie on march 21 this year.Must say disappointment.But much better than Tridev.Plot is hackneyed.Tells about Prabhat who lives with his father,Wife and his little brother.The movie opens when he saves a bride.Anyway.Azghar Jhurhad makes a plot to kill his young brother.He makes a plan by sending few man.They come to a school pretended to be Prabhats friends.Kill that kid.His father throws him out of the house.Then later comes back.He and Aakash go to Kenya to find him.Sunny gives a good performance,Chunky was annoying at best,Naseerdun is wasted.Divya did good,Sonam was wasted,Jyotsna was wasted but looked cute.The kid which played Sunnys brother in the movie was cute.Too sad he had to get his character killed.The girl was cute but was annoying.The other kid did good.Alok did good.Kiran was adequate.Amrish and Gulshan did good.The cinematography is excellent in both India and Kenya.Script is weak but has a few good dialogs.Also drags .The movie.The music was alright.I only liked one songSaat Samundar the lyrics of that song was good.The other songs were forgettable.Do not watch this.

His biographical series of the life of his master, Mas Oyama, were amazing and among the best martial arts films ever made, as were most of his Street Fighter films. The action was practically nonstop and with the possible exception of Bruce Lee depending on who you ask, he was the greatest martial arts practitioner on film during the 1970s. Because they are so good, I have seen at least 15 of his films and recently bought some more which I am in the process of watching.Unfortunately, despite my love of these films, I am NOT a mindnumbed zombie who worships the man to such a degree that I rate EVERY film a 10. There are a few reviews like this here on IMDb and I truly think that anyone giving this film a 10 should be ignored because this is such a bad film from a technical standpoint and is not even close to the being Chibas best work. A score of 10 is not a real ratingit is some zombie fan trying to make a statement about Chiba, not this film! As I said, technically this film is awful. Some of this was the result of my seeing the American dubbed version, with its irrelevant prologue and bad dubbing. But most of the problem would still exist with the original Japanese print. The camerawork is simply atrociouslike it was done by chimps smart chimps, but still chimps nonetheless. Often, much of the fast martial arts action is missed because the camera is so slow or the tops of the actors heads are clipped off due to the shoddiness of production. And, again and again, the camera pans in and out like it is a new toy being used by an idiot plus the editing is beyond wretchedwith cuts being done haphazardly and confusingly.I do not know whether the musical score is original or notbut it was also very, very bad. Sort of like acid rock of 1970 blended poorly with Ennio Morricones Spaghetti Western musicit was annoying, distracting and just plain silly.As for the martial arts action, I think that having chimps do the choreography would have improved things a bit. Instead of the great fight scenes you would look forward to in a Chiba film, the fights are too brief and often missed by the camera!! So what you are left with is the story...and this MIGHT just be the worst part of the film! It is supposed to be an antidrug film starring Sonny Chiba as....Sonny Chiba! And when the film begins, he vows to destroy the drug trade in Japan. But, the Mafia complete with not a single member who looks Italian, but who are ALL Japanese vows to stop Chiba. And, when a lady comes to Chiba with promises to give him information about how to destroy the drug trade, he agrees to help her and risk his life with no conditionseven though she is NEVER forthright about telling him what she knows! In fact, later it turns out she is just trying to use Chiba to protect her while she herself sells a huge briefcase full of cocaineand he CONTINUES trying to protect her!! This makes no sense at all and throughout much of the film it looks as if they just shot the film without a scriptsuch as when they went into the bars and brothels and had Chiba walking about as if he was drunk.So if it was THAT bad, why still does it merit a 3? Well, first, there are many more horrid marital arts films such as many of those from Hong Kong in the 1970sincluding one with guys dressed up in gorilla suits doing kung fu and their handlers with 3 foot long tongues they used for fighting now That is bad. Second, while the action is very bad compared to other Sonny Chiba films, compared to its contemporaries, it is not that bad. Still, you could easily do a lot better than this horrid little film.By the way, if you are wondering if this is the worst Sonny Chiba film, it certainly is not! In one of his first films, INVASION OF THE NEPTUNE MEN, Chiba plays a leotardwearing superhero who battles pointyheaded invaders from the planet Neptune. It is so bad that it rivals PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and THEY SAVED HITLERS BRAIN for awfulness.A final note to parentsLike most of Sonny Chibas films, this one is very violent and has its share of boobies. Do not let little kids watch this no matter how much they beg! Make them wait until they are older before you let them watch wretched ratedR martial arts films!","label":0},{"index":11025,"txt":"The first few minutes of The Bodyguard do have a campy charm it opens with crawling text from the Bible the part that Samuel Jackson recites to his soontobe victims in Pulp Fiction, continues with two karate school teachers in New York arguing about the eternal question of mankind who is better?

To keep it simple, heres why The Bodyguard is an unbearable movie to watch1 You do not know what is going on. 2 There are barely any fights. 3 The fights that are there, are short and terribly filmed.Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Lee is gorgeous, her face is glorious. It is only for them that I give The Bodyguard a 2nd star out of 10. This movie makes 87 minutes feel like 5 hours.","label":0},{"index":11026,"txt":"The best thing you can say about this movie is that if you are a fan of Sonny Chiba, this movie gives you lots of him. Chiba makes speeches; Chiba poses; Chiba sneers; Chiba glares at the camera; Chiba punches and kicks the living sushi out of a whole bunch of bad guys; Chiba sits around on couches and chairs and looks thoughtfulpensive; Chiba drives his car...I enjoy Chiba as an actor and a martial artist...but even for a Chiba fan, this movie may have a little too much Sonny Chiba. It is obviously something of a vanity vehicle for him. And no, I would not put Street Fighter in the same category, because in SF he plays a ruthless, amoral antihero and he shares the camera with an intriguing cast of friends and foes. Here, he is front and center almost all the time, and he tries to be Batman, Captain America and Bruce Lee rolled into one. Toshiro Mifune and Chow Yun Fat could not pull this off for the length of an entire feature film, and Sonny just kind of wears out his welcome. At least he could have changed out of his suit once in a while.The movie is further messed up by an entirely gratuitous and badly done introductory sequence apparently tacked on to the front of the film for the American version and a goofy cheer Viva!! Chiba!! Viva!! Chiba!! that starts things on the wrong foot. There is some astoundingly amateurish and inappropriate dubbing  Sonny or his usual English standin apparently could not be bothered to do the vocals for the American version, so they got some poor dope with an entirely different and smoother voice and dialect that is quite jarring coming from the face we all know and love from Street Fighter. Even with all those flaws and the overexposure, this could still be a minor classic, but the camera work and the fight scenes are hopelessly cheesy. I am willing to believe that Karate actually works if someone as amazing as Chibas character is supposed to be does it, but the director and cameraman hedged their bets by chopping and editing fight scenes with a weed whacker so you cannot really see what is going on most of the time. It is not all bad there are some decent shots and compositions, and there is at least one memorable and nightmarish moment when the bad guys appear in the clients bedroom in a genuinely inventive way. And as for the actual plot...forget it. For a bodyguard, Chibas character is something of an idiot. The screenplay depends on his making mistakes and oversights that repeatedly place him and his client in perilous situations so he can fight his way out of them, and after 30 minutes, it strains even the most credulous judgment to think that this guy is supposed to be any good. Also, If his character was really out to destroy the Japanese drug trade, he would have taken his client by her neck 10 minutes into the screenplay and shaken her until her teeth chattered like a castanet until she spilled her little secrets...and a whole lot of pointless death and conflict would have been avoided. Still, as a whole this movie is a long way from the bottom of the barrel. It is still Sonny Chiba, and he is still fun to watch. I paid a buck to get this off the bargain DVD rack at a local mega mart, and I feel it was worth watching once.","label":0},{"index":11027,"txt":"Avoid the USA version. It is with added US footage and the worst dubbing you have ever heard probably done by New York amateurs. The dubbing is so bad that it sounds like Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Instead of this Americanized version watch Chibas other greats like The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.","label":0},{"index":11028,"txt":"I liked Chiba in Street Fighter, and I figured hey, no matter how stupid this movie will be, I will at least get to see him kick some ass, right? Wrong. This is a dull, dreary mess of pointless talking, halfassed scriptwriting and meaningless scheming. There are few action scenes of any kind, even fewer martial arts scenes, and the few that are are shot and edited so poorly that you cannot even make out what in the world is going on. The dub is also atrocious, and perhaps the idiocy that is this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it supposedly features the Italian Mafia... EXCEPT They are ALL Japanese!

It was beyond annoying. The angles were all wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during the fight sequences. The closeups were even horrible.The story has Sonny Chiba hiring himself out as a bodyguard to anyone willing to lead him to the top of a drug ring. He is approached by Judy Lee, who is never quite straight with Chiba. Lees involvement in the drug ring is deeper than Chiba thought, as the Mob and another gang of thugs are after her.The story was decent, and despite horrible dubbing, this could have been a good movie. Given better direction and editing, I am sure this would have been a classic Kung Foo movie. As it is, it is more like another cheesy 70s action movie.Note The opening sequence has a quote familiar to Pulp Fiction fans, and then continues to a karate school in Times Square that is in no way related to the rest of the movie.Rating 4 out of 10","label":0},{"index":11030,"txt":"This is easily one of the worst martial arts films I have ever seen, and that is saying something. The chant of viva Chiba, viva Chiba is heard at the title, soon you will be chanting to yourself stupid, stupid. The basic story is that the mafia is running drugs into Japan and one man vowels to stop them, of course that is our man Sonny Chiba. The Karate master offers up his service to anyone who can provide information on the drug lords. A woman comes forward and he becomes the bodyguard, but what are her true intentions? Let me say at this point who cares? Soon we are treated to or tortured by a series of poorly choreographed fights and a lame storyline that becomes more and more laughable at every moment. Sonny eventually wipes out the bad guys with his karate skills, end of story. Oh yeah the woman was corrupt too. Congratulations you may have just watched the funniest film ever.As stated already this is one of the worst martial arts films I have ever seen. What makes it semi watchable is to see how badly made a film can be. Some have already mentioned the infamous American intro put into the film. That is probably the most entertaining part of the film and it is beyond funny. I would agree its worth watching just to see how lame the 70s karate scene was at the time. Watch as Aaron Banks leaves a guy hanging by his nuts then flips a fat student bad editing punching him in the throat. But everything is badly done in this film. Terrible unbelievable fights, fake I mean fake blood, bad acting, dubbing, wardrobe, and let us not forget the story. One man to take out an entire drug problem in a country? I bet. Fight after fight is laughable. This was the 70s when people still believed karate was effective in a fight, but Chiba brings it to new levels with some of the nonsense put out in this movie. Let us see he kicks a gun in half, kicks a guy so hard what looks like his dentures fall out and of course chopping the bottle scene, give me a break. Not to mention the fact that it is very hard to tell what happens in the fights because it is filmed so poorly. One part that was amusing was when he broke the guys arm through the door giving him a compound fracture. OK. As the action goes on we are treated to gobs of blood, really fake blood. Too say it looked poorly made is and understatement. The acting is totally non existent in this film. I do not expect much from a film of this caliber anyway as long as the action is good, but it was not and as expected the dubbing is extremely poor. Was it my imagination or did they dub the Asian go go dancer with a black accent? As expected from a 70s wardrobe you will be in stitches laughing at some of the trends and nasty women put forth for the gratuitous nudity that comes with these flicks. Also why would the mafia be so obvious and all where black trench coats and hats all the time? Do not try and hide it now. The characters were stupid as well. The pimp club owners one of whom is decked out in a Japanese pimp suit and the other who has a taste for bores head looks like fat hippie. Also one last thing that bothered me throughout the film was the awful music with some woman whaling. It was very annoying.Overall this is a terrible film by both martial arts standards and good movie making. That does not mean that it is not entertaining. With a film made so poorly it is hard not to laugh through most of this film, if you can stomach it. This was an old favorite watch with my best friend. If it was purely bad I would give one star, but the laughs it delivers bumps it up. 4 out 10.","label":0},{"index":11031,"txt":"I had quite high hopes for this film, even though it got a bad review in the paper.

And when the film climaxed in an orgy where the boy drinks both his mothers milk, as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film, I almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it is.Do not get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, so this flick should have pleased me enormously.

This film must break some record for worst written and delivered lines.The camera work was also really bad  you can hardly see what is going on in the fight scenes due to switching camera angles and shakiness.I would have voted 1 except that I do like Chiba and sidekick Sue Shihomi, and I was entertained by a couple of scenes 1 breaking of a villains arm so the bone pops out of the skin that is gotta hurt 2 a drug kingpin eating a brownfurred animal a monkey?? by hacking away at the carcass with a meat cleaver 3 Sonny Chibas performing some impromptu eye surgery on a guy with his fingers.I am actually a big fan of Sonny Chiba but this one is really not worth anyones time. I have seen about 7 or 8 of his films and have come to the conclusion that the only ones worth watching and they are great! are the Street Fighter series, and The Killing Machine.

It takes place in a fictional, cartoonish Washington D.C., and centers around the satirical, childish representations of George W. Bush, Condoleeza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheyney. Other politicians are also satirized in the same manner, and act as minor characters.The pilot of little Bush, much to this commentators expectations, proved to be a rather shallow and esoteric production, which barely delivers on its featured promise a satirical look at the current presidential administration. While one must admit that premise of the show does have SOME merit, even though it would be hard to imagine a show based almost completely of the denigration of a single political persona would survive to continue to produce episodes after his term of office expired, execution that can only be described as sloppy at best, and downright awful at worst, has marred what little potential the show had.Lil Bush, which may be technically classified as satire, tends to disregard its actual use of the particular tool of comedy in order to lambaste its targets in exceptionally vulgar but not particularly original, entertaining, or funny ways. The show is consistently weak writing often consists of little more than recording BushCheney jokes heard elsewhere ad nauseam and placing them all in a single 30 minute block of television. As such, most of the jokes that presented by the writers were shameless clich\u00e9s, some of which that been in public circulation for more than 6 years already. Comparing the Vice President to Darth Vader, for example, may have been funny in the first 300 times one has heard it on the Daily ShowColbert ReportLettermanConan OBrienLeno monologueany latenighttalkshowever, but it is not funny here. As if that were not enough, the show is plots seem to exist simply as a means to advance the same old, tiresome Bush jokes that the writers have made the center of the program.In the show is defense, when the writers dare to write in a truly original joke which seems to be a rarity it is often somewhat humorous. If the show were to expand its depth somewhat, and place its characters into new situations, exotic situations, rather than the same old mistakes and quagmires perpetuated by the Bush administration, therefore not having to rely on the same old Bush jokes over and over again, the show might be considered somewhat tolerable, and possibly even innovative.Ultimately, it is difficult to ascertain which shortcoming causes the Lil Bush series the most damage; its clear lack of originality and weak writing quality, or its painfully narrow minded ambitions. It is reasonable to expect that Lil Bush will be able to maintain a small base of left wing fans, that is, if they are able to endure the exceptionally poor writing; so long as the program continues to lampoon the Bush administration thoroughly. Even so, the majority of viewers will soon recognize the program for what it really is, a weak and pointlessly vulgar attempt at satire, and tune out in search of something more intellectually stimulation; The Price is Right, perhaps.","label":0},{"index":11034,"txt":"I want to start by stating I am a republican, even though I do not agree with a lot of the things bush has done in office.

I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic.My problem with drivel like this sad excuse for political satire is that these folks are getting a second season. I am a liberal republican and I know Bush has not been a good president. We all do. But that is no excuse for putting out this utterly poopie waste of time. I place these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind Meet the Spartans. Their formula, bite off as many already unfunny topical jokes as you can and throw in even worse original material to actually be able to give yourself writing credit.Again, just plain bad. Unfunny, and it just makes me more and more unhappy that crap like this is renewed, but amazing and original shows like Arrested Development are canned after 3 solid seasons. Please do not watch this crap, unless you are one of those green blooded liberal hippies who think any sentence with the words Bush and dumb is comedic gold. Oh, and the voice of Bush sucks. All he does is slightly emulate a Texan accent, and exhale really hard at the end of his sentences. At least South Park admits the voices are not accurate.

One reader even so it seems actually indicates that he believes these events did or could have happened when Bush was in grade school.But as to the content as I see it, trying to be neutral, is that the group that made this series must actually be really Bush haters. In the Episode that I saw last, s02e03, it showed that the program must have been put together long before McCain became the front runner for the nomination; because, the other former front runners are all featured.Another thing that caught my attention, was the use of add in closets.

Sure there are problems as most American will agree, but that is no reason to be so hateful in public displays seen around the world. Perhaps the trend has now been set by this show and network, so that IF Obama or Hillary got in, would they continue to produce and air the same sort of humor about them?Just one more comment on a commentators remarks.

First off I want to say that the story behind this movie and the creation of the Amber Alert system is a good one. However the movie itself was poorly made and the acting was terrible. The major problem I had with the movie involved the second half with Nichole Timmons and father Glenn Park. The events surrounding that part of the story were not entirely correct. My father was suffering from psychological disorders at the time and picked up Nichole without any intent to harm her at all. He loved her like a daughter and was under the mindset that he was rescuing her from some sort of harm or neglect that he likely believed was coming from her mother who paid little attention to her over the 3 plus years that my father took care of her and summarily raised her so her mother could frolic about. The movie depicted my father in a manner that he was going to harm her in some way shape or form. The funny thing is that Nichole had spent many nights sometimes consecutively at my fathers place while Sharon would be working or doing whatever she was doing. The reason that my father was originally thought to be violent was because he had items that could be conceived to be weapons on his truck. My father was a landscaper. The items they deemed to be weapons were landscaping tools that he kept in his truck all the time for work. My recommendation is take this movie with a grain of salt, it is a good story and based on true events however the details of the movie at least the Nichole Timmons  Glenn Park portion are largely inaccurate and depict the failure of the director to discover the truth in telling the story. The funny thing is, that if the director would have interviewed any of Sharons friends who knew the situation they would have stated exactly what I have posted here.","label":0},{"index":11050,"txt":"Carnosaur 3 Primal Species 1996 D Jonathan Winfrey.

If that is what you can call it. There is one character who, I suppose, is supposed to be from the south. However, after living in the south for six years now, I have never heard this way of talking. Perhaps he has some sort of weird disability  the inability to talk normally. I find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent  therefore there was no reason for the actor to try to do one.How about the plot? It is pretty basic  Raptors escape, people with guns must hunt them down. I am starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest system of tunnels... would not they stay outside to hunt prey? Oh well, at least they have the good sense to appear very very little in the movie which supposedly revolves around them.Other things  Let us say you are in a building and you know that there are man eating raptors running around in it. Would you decide to take time out to have an argument about who is better  Army or Marine? And then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it?

They brought back Rick Dean for another spotlight character and Michael MacDonald as a police officer. Now for Rick dean lol, in Carnosaur 2 I thought he fit the role pretty well and was not really annoyed by him, now in Carnosaur 3 wow they placed him as an elite soldier. Now we are getting goofy here. The movie actually started out pretty good with a decent gun fight and dinos escaping out of there little freezer trucks, but as soon as Scott Valentines team showed up we had a mix of a romantic comedy with very funny performances from retarded and floppy dinosaurs.I will start with the raptors first, they had there tails drag the ground, which in the second one they were up in the air which looked more common for a dinosaur that can run up to 5060 mph. Now when they ran they wiggled back and forth and the heads did not move at all. there hands were floppy all over the place and since they were extremely poorly shot by the director they looked stupid and out of place.The trex was extremely pathetic, they would of been better off using the one from the previous 2 movies. At least that one looked somewhat frightening. The one in this film looked like it was smiling all the time. The legs when it walked was hilarious, like it was john wayne in the old west all stiff legged and stuff. LOL another thing I noticed is that the hands did not move, they were stuck next to its body so it looked and sounded god the sound effects were awful retarded!!! Now if I was the director and realized that I had this to work with maybe I would of maybe tried a little bit harder to hide the fakeness fact. As for the rest of the movie, well this was the sloppiest and loudest military team I have ever seen. The weapons they used would not make sense for the scenario. They even had an arm wrestling scene inside the warehouse where the carnosaurs were roaming, now I was tickled at this scene because I thought that while this stupidity was going on that the Dinos would get in there and cause some damage.

That last part was actually funny on many occasions You see these natives hitting congas and jemb\u00e9s and that is indeed what you hear badly synchronized on the soundtrack. But they also added this funky bassline on the soundtrack. So, where was the bassplayer? At one point the natives get angry and start killing the tourists. Why all of the sudden? It is supposed to be because the evil white men build this tourist complex, which according to their myth awakened the wrath of the riveralligatorgod I actually missed the explanation for that one.

It is all silly and pointless. This movie also features the skinniest AfroAmerican model I have ever seen.At one point our heroic leading couple visits this cave where a weird, crazy old man lives. The only point to that scene is that they make the shocking discovery that the killercrocodile is actually an alligator. Crocodile or alligator, what is the difference? It is big, it is made out of plastic and it eats people. All the same to me. The alligator is a rather silly creation. It is very stiff  motionless and does not even flap its feet when it swims. The eyes do not even move when they are shot in closeup. I guess they did not know animatronics back then in Italy during 1979. There is also a lot of pointless intercut shots of the local wildlife. I suspect it is stock footage.Like, I said, the first hour was pretty lame and the only reason I did not switch off the movie was because my cat was asleep on my lap and I did not want to wake the sweet thing. But the last half hour of the movie did get better. We finally get to see some action when the alligator swims through a horde of panicking people snapping its teeth and munching on them. The most entertaining and at the same time funny scene is when Alice and Daniel drive a van over a bridge and it collapses. We are looking at a matchboxversion of the van falling in the river here. Funny. But nicely shot. In fact there are several other nice traveling cameramoves. Surprisingly for this type of flick. I was gonna point out some stupid details concerning the end of the movie, but I do not wanna spoil it completely, in case you do decide to watch this movie. My advice is to stay away from it. If you wanna see a decent alligator movie, then see Lewis Teagues ALLIGATOR. I admit, that one is not Italian and is not a JAWS ripoff, but it certainly is more fun. And if you are interested in other movies made by director Sergio Martino, then I strongly recommend the highly entertaining 2019 AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK.

Italians and ripoffs, two words that go together very well.","label":0},{"index":11083,"txt":"First off I want to say that this film is worthy of more than the four stars I rated it. I gave it four stars because for me this 86 minute movie always seems like 2 and a half hours and is not engaging enough to sit through it all. However, The Big Alligator River the title my DVD calls it is better than your average nature strikes back movie.A tourist resort in the jungles of Southeast Asia is just opening and employs the natives while trying to manipulate the wildlife around. Mother Nature seeking revenge comes in the form of the god Kroona, a giant Alligator. But the creature is not the only thing the tourists and the main characters a photographer and the resort staff have to worry about, the natives are getting rubbed the wrong way too.This movie is a pretty welldone adventurehorror story with a good musical score and direction. But the alligator itself, the main attraction of the movie, is obviously fake looking. Some of the closeups of its jaws are good but that should be all we need to see. Some of the underwater faraway shots make it painfully obvious that what we are really dealing with is an alligator squeakytoy you can probably get at a zoo souvenir shop. But the natives are believable, if not authentic.Probably not the movie that will give you nonstop thrills, if any, but shot and produced well enough to be given good mention. And like a lot of creature movies, this one ends with an extremely high body count. It also has lots of good jungle scenery. Acting is below par though, but who was expecting it to be better, eh? Much, much better than its recent American counterpart Primeival but nothing to be compared with Jaws. But remember it may not be engaging at a few points.","label":0},{"index":11084,"txt":"Let me start out by saying I can enjoy just about any bad Italian horror movie or jungle exploitation flick from the 1970s. Seriously. This one was downright awful.There are way too many elements that Martino tries to inject and none of them work except for the crocgonewild thing very well at all. There are some ignorant Westerners, of course, who set up a resort in the jungle somewhere. I do not even remember where it takes place...how sad is that... Basically, people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its ceremonies but eventually they upset the Alligator God of the river who then proceeds to go on a rampage, killing said vacationers and some tribesmen as well. Sounds good, yeah? Well, do not get your hopes up. There is minimal violence until the end, the special effects are so bad it was like a kindergarten class performed them and the love story thrown in is laughable.There is seriously a few scenes where it appears they set up a camera underwater in a pool and threw a toy alligator, like a dart, into the water and that is supposed to be the gator attacking. I am not kidding. In another wonderfully crafted special effect, a Matchbox van is targeted by the incredible sinking plastic gator, who all of a sudden is five times the size of a van. A few minutes ago, he was only big enough to eat a human, but now he dwarfs a fullsize cargo van... It is really pathetic. The only other flick I can think of where the effects were so bad I was pulled out of the story was Bruno Matteis masterpiece, Rats, what with the plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all who Could not be terrified.Normally I would say anything Sergio Martino was a solid mustsee but this one is a mustpass.

He soon becomes involved in the investigation of an unsolved murder which leads to his theorizing about the existence of a serial killer whom no one else believes in. The known victim is theorized to be blind, which leads to a romance with a blind girl  believed to be a witness  at a nearby school for the blind.Despite a basically intriguing story there were too many quantum leaps and plot holes in this movie where I found myself wondering, how the hell did we wind up here? or how did we find this out?

Sure, the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison, who wear street clothes btw quite comical, but NOTHING happens.There are not strong rivalries, no one tries to seduce the warden or doctor in order to try and escape, and no inmates make out. There are 2 shower scenes, that I suspect is just recycled footage, but no fights breaks out  no one is seduced here  or anywhere for that matter! Aside from the lack of plot, unconvincing, unsympathetic, and flat characters, a couple of inmates that do manage to escape actually return to the prison in order to free their fellow inmates??!!PUHLEASE, the movie should have just ended off with the escapees riding off into the sunset...as opposed to letting this mess continue!I feel scammed.","label":0},{"index":11088,"txt":"The thing that stands out in my mind in this film sadly is the introduction, where John Berlin Andy Garcia is driving into town. You see his Mercedes pass on a winding road through a forest that looks like its loaded with Redwood trees. It is quite beautiful. As to Andy Garcia playing a character with the last name of Berlin, well...Andy is just too hispanicLatin for it to be passable. Maybe a caucasian father married his Spanish mother for this story? Who knows. But I can tell you that when you put him in a town of farm folks and hicks, he stands out like a sore thumb, especially with his accent that flares up when he gets angry. Yeah, I know, big deal right? He is still a good actor.The title concerns a serial killer who nicknames his victims Jennifer. All of the victims are blind and he dismembers them. The killer has taken a hiatus but suddenly resurfaces when a blind witness do not ask appears, Helena Robertson Uma Thurman. Thurman does a good job of playing a blind person, to my surprise. When I saw Lance Henriksen playing Sgt. Freddy Ross I got worried. Henriksens played in some pretty strange films, especially of late. I still cannot forget him in the bloodbath movie, Pumpkinhead. Berlin movies into a small town from L.A. as a detective. He begins investigating the Jennifer murders after finding body parts in the local landfill. His brilliance in discovering one of the victims was blind seemed farfetched. So did the irony of SPOILER Freddys murder, with the recording and name similarities. I got very confused as to the logic of how there came to be eight Jennifers. And the motive of the killer as simply deranged did not pack much of a punch. In retrospect, this film is probably more true to life in showing an unsuspecting individual as capable of murder simply because they became a little wacko over time or maybe were born looney toons.John Malkovich does a stupendous job in his interrogation of Garcia! Albeit no cop would legally be allowed to press someone that hard and egg them on without rightfully get knocked out. As to the ending, it is a bit of a surprise, but is highly arguable, much like Sgt. Ross murder. The killer chooses to walk after his running victim, opting instead to frolick I guess.And there are so many opportunities he has in killing her that it is ridiculous. I will not ruin the very end because despite it is shakiness, it is a good surprise.

I could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time. Just do not watch the movie. I have warned you.","label":0},{"index":11091,"txt":"Possible Plot SpoilersI adore Dennis Hopper. I question why he accepted the role of a police detective in 2000s The Spreading Ground. This movie flat out sucks and I am about to tell you why.This is about a small town which is about to get a contract for a sports arena. One hitch there is a killer on the loose and that is bad for business. The Mayor makes a deal with the Irish Mob to find the killer and make sure he never makes it to court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants this guy caught too, but he is on the level and believes in the system. He wants to see the system do it is job.That could have been pretty good. It could have been riveting. It was horrible. First, they label this guy a Serial Killer. Err no. There are specific criteria and none of it fits here. The bad guy has killed 5 kids the first day, and I think it was 2 the second day. This entire movie spans like a 48 hour time period.... Hardly Serial Killer action. I do not care what warped motives they give him in the end, Serial Killers do their deed over a long time span. They do not just all of a sudden kill 7 kids in two days. That is a Spree.Ok that irritant aside, the acting was atrocious. The only name here was Hopper, and he is the only one who came even close to pulling off his part. Unfortunately, he is kinda typecast to me and I think he does psycho parts much, much better. This just was not a good vehicle for Hopper. It did not allow him to do what he does best, which is to act all creepy. It is not that he did bad, it is that I have seen him do so much better.The Irish Mob guy, Johnny Gault Tom McCamus  Long Days Journey Into Night, who is in charge of their investigation is just over the top stiff. Contradiction? Not really. He is trying to play the cold, hard kinda guy and he does that to the point that the character is just wooden. Boring to the max. He did not scare me. He did not inspire any emotion at all except boredom. I cannot tell you how many times I checked to see how much longer it was til the end of this movie.The other thing about this is that it had the feel of a madeforTV movie. You know what I mean. The poor production values, low budget, reuse of scenes to save costs. Just eh. Yanno? But, I feel like comparing this to those is an insult to those.Derek Vanlint was both the Director and Cinematographer on this project. He bit off more than he could chew. I cannot help feeling that Hopper must have took this role as a personal favor to a friend. That is the only rational I can come up with. This was Vanlints first job as Director, third as cinematographer. Hopefully this was a learning experience for him.I will not ruin the ending in case you do decide to torture yourself with this one, but I do want to say that they all dropped the ball here...even Hopper. In a scene that should have been emotionally gutwrenching for the detective, it was just..well.. blah. I did not see any of the angst at all that would accompany the total gearchange this guy made. Very disappointing.This 100 grueling minutes long and Rated R for violence and language. No kid under 13 is going to have any interest whatsoever in watching this, so no worries there.

It seemed a lot like the movie Jaws when the Hopper was telling the Mayor to close parks was like when Roy Shider was telling the Mayor to close the beaches. They both said no way its summer!

I am not even a little convinced he and his partner have any experience doing police work when they are in the office wondering how they are gonna solve this case. They just say lets do police work and we will solve it. And whats up with all the old men with pool cues. I did not even begin to believe that they were mob bosses. And then the guy who was doubting the guy the mob picked to handle finding the killer. With his hundred dollar haircut and that he thinks his Dik is the size of a schoolbus.

Oh and it was funny seeing the microphone above the scene where hopper is going out to get coffee.","label":0},{"index":11094,"txt":"The movie had a good concept, but the execution just did not live up to it.What is this concept? Well, storywise, it is Dirty Harry meets M. A child killer has begun terrorizing a city. The lead detectives Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest have never dealt with a serial killer before. The Mayor and the Police Chief, in desperation, secretly hire the local mob to speed things up...to go places and do things that the police would not be able to in order to bring an end to this mess as soon as possible.To be fair, this film DOES genuinely have some good things to offer.Besides the concept, I liked the look of the killers hideout. Norman Bates has his basement. This guy has an eerie sewer. In some of the shots, the light bounces off the water and creates rippling reflections on the walls; often giving these scenes a creepy, dreamlike quality.The acting was good too. Dennis Hopper is one of those actors who gets better with age.Once you get past that, however, it moreorless goes downhill.The film is paced way too fast. The actual investigation process from both teams feels very rushed as opposed to feeling intricate and fascinating. This could have been fixed in two ways either make the film longer or cut out some of the many subplots. Either of these would have allowed the crew to devote more time to the actual mystery.For an example of how bad this is, one of the crucial clues that helps them zero in on just the right suspect is this at one point in his life, the suspect went to a pet shop...That is right...I am being totally serious here. It is like they went from point A the first clue to point Z the suspect and skipped over all the inbetween steps.Then there is the characters. The only ones I actually liked were two pickpockets you meet about halfway through the movie. Considering that they are minor characters, I would call that a bad sign.Finally, there is the mob angle. This is the one that gets me the most because THIS is why I coughed up the 3 to buy the DVD in the first place. I mean, what a hook! There is been an absolute glut of serial killer flicks in the last 1015 years. The mob angle was a gimmick that COULD have helped it rise above the rest..., but it did not.I figured the gangsterss methods would be brutal, but fun and thrilling at the same time; kind of like a vigilante movie or something...maybe they would even throw in some heist movie elements too. We ARE talking about criminals, after all. Instead, we are given some of the most repulsive protagonists committed to celluloid. The detectives question witnesses. What does the mob do? They interrogate and kill them. It is not even like these witnesses are really even that bad either. I actually found the criminals less likable than the killer they are hunting.Unless the good points I mentioned are enough to get your interest, I would say give this one a miss. Maybe some day, they will reuse the same story idea and do it RIGHT. I hope so. I hate to see such a good concept go to waste.","label":0},{"index":11095,"txt":"Dennis Hopper is without a doubt one of the finest underrated American actors of our time, and it was interesting to see how he would play out his role as a cop on the case of a child serial killer. Most movies Hopper has always played to psychotic menace threatening to blow up stuff or go on a killing spree, but in this movie, Hopper tried his best to keep that intensity and emotion while carrying a shield. Once I got into the plot of the movie, I was hooked, but it is just the little things that ultimately murdered the film.The concept of the film is great  not only are the cops on the move of catching the killer, but we get a chance to see how the gangsters operate in catching the killer. The subplot of the football stadium is kinda ridiculous, but necessary to involve the gangsters in the killer hunt.That is about all that is good you can say about the film. Although Hopper did try to act like a tough, experienced street smart cop, I cannot help but feel his acting was below par, and there was not enough conviction that he was truly attached to the case. The directing was also terrible  it did not have the feel of a true film, but rather a TVmovie production. This is most evident when the gangsters meet for the first time to form an elite team to hunt the killer down. When the leading gangster shoots the other mouthy gangster in slow motion, the acting was weak, predictable and terribly unexciting. That is when I knew that 1st of all, the action is going to be atrocious.The angling of the camera was amateurish, and the recalling scenes or haunting images of the killers little sister had no true distinctive effect. If it was supposed to be scary, it was not. Everyones acting was terrible, and even for Hopper, I did not feel for his character, and I just did not really care too much about his relationship with his daughter.The final thing that bothered me the most is the swat team. Once I saw the swat team in action, I was thinking, finally, something good. But I was wrong. 1st of all, the entire swat team consisted of 4 guys. That is just impossible. 2nd of all, apparently the swat team has no training whatsoever because many times in the film they carry their HKA4 submachine guns with one hand. Had the killer been hiding near the staircase with a shotgun, these 4 idiots would have been blown to bits because they were not even aiming at anything or paying close attention. They should have had both hands on the gun aiming forward, but it just looks like they are not taking the job seriously and are just flaunting around. 3rd, SWAT team members do not yell out commands such as Keep your eyes open, watch out for yourselves, are we good to go...etc. In reality, they use hand signals or have radios. But they are literally yelling at each other  how are you supposed to catch the killer when he can hear you are coming??? And to top it all off, these guys have no plan  apparently they are just running up and down going on a wild turkey chase. Eventually they end up doing nothing. That was the last straw. I am no expert on special forces, but basically what I have just outlined, is pretty common sense. When the audience knows the movie is terrible, the action pretty much becomes the lifesaver of the movie  when you cannot even make an effort to make the action great, the movie is lost.I give 2 stars for the concept, but the rest cannot be credited.

Patiently i waited for it is DVD release, then bought it rushing home for an enjoyable evenings viewing. The anticipation on the way home was far better than the film. For a start the direction is appalling. There is no thought gone into it at all and the director just makes up a part for himself, so he can appear in the film. I would not be rushing out to employ him in the future. Secondly the lead role is completely miscast as Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe normally the cool character as in Cruel Intentions and Way of the Gun but in this he is supposed to be a bumbling hero which he attempts to portray by slipping when he is running and having geeky friends, but he just does not look right. The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani do not feature enough but when they do neither of the performances are close to their bests. The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been made for him and it is his fiery temper and mysterious ways that drag the film along. The final point is that this film is another one which fills the trailer with scenes you do not see in the film and instead feature only in the deleted scenes section of the DVD.

I do not hate the film, but it is missing key elements, such as suspense. There have been other attempts to make an engaging film about computers, such as Hackers and The Net. They all fall short. The improbable ending of both The Net and Antirust seem to be nearly identical. These movie endings suffer from one huge error in perception People in the PC business having this overindulgent self ego that assumes the general population lives it is life waiting to hear the latest news about PCs and software. I have worked for many companies and industries, and they all seem to suffer from an expanded view of their own selfimportance, as does this film.The way they introduced plot lines was pathetic. Showing Milo, who is deathly allergic to Sesame Seeds, almost ingest one from a restaurant breadbasket crossed the line of stupidity. Only his girlfriend prevented him from sure death. This makes one wonder how Milo could have survived as long as he did, braving the perils of Big Mac buns and Sesame Seed breadsticks, as they cloak themselves as, well.... Sesame Seed breadsticks and Big Mac buns.Antitrust also does not provide much suspense. The patterned and predictable plot twists are easily figured out long before they are revealed come on, was anyone REALLY stunned when Yee Jee Tso was killed?, thereby destroying any real shock value.

Still, I pressed on. Maybe the ending would be the payoff, but no. The completely ridiculous ending where we have the head of company security, another supposed evil guy, turn around and be the good guy that enables Milo to bring down N.U.R.V CEO Gary Winston was laughable. And of course, the news coverage of the arrest of Gary Winston is more fevered than when Hinckley or Oswald was brought into custody. Gary Winston, played by Tim Robbins, is a cardboard cutout of the same character Robbins played in Arlington Road.

He has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica Jennifer Bealswho may or may not be married but who Aldolpho would love to star in his movie. When Al unexpectedly gets a financial promise of funding for his film from a strange man named Joe, he thinks he is got it made. That is, until Joe takes Al along on an adventure to steal a Porsche for part of the financial backing. Will the film be made before Aldolpho is completely without a moral backbone? And, will Angelica star in the film? This is, in this viewers opinion, an awful movie. The script is abysmal, with a plot that wanders willy nilly. Beals practically snarls all of her lines and Buscemi, though likable, is nondescript. There is a good deal of distasteful material and unsavory characters to boot. Finally, the production values are very poor, too, making the film look second rate at all times. If you have time on your hands, it is still a good idea not to take a chance with this movie. But, if you are the proverbial glutton for punishment, go ahead and watch the darn thing. Beals does look beautiful, after all.","label":0},{"index":11111,"txt":"How Disney can you get?

Using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach. Still unfortunately, despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between Muslim and western culture, adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gayslesbians, it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film. This leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle, attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with.However, this does not mean that the film is directly bad, as it is rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing. The film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter, but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep. This has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts. By this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation.Even if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama, the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when the ball drops. This way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard clich\u00e9 that becomes ridiculous in its happyending. Nothing is left out in the Hollywood like ending. So even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages, one cannot help but roll eyes towards the resolution. Personally I was close to shouting finish already!! at the screen.There were some decent acting in the film, and the two young female central characters had some good moments. So did their parents and other bicharacters. However the handsome Irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting, that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism. He did not even appear very likable, but rather self involved despite his good deeds, which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained.I give the film a 4, as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from. The script and cast had many good believable characters, giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others. Had the letdowns not been this disappointing, I would easily give the film a 7 or 8. If you enjoyed this film, I would recommend the film East is East, which I think is an as good, if not better rendering of cultural conflict, as well as being amusing and engaging.","label":0},{"index":11121,"txt":"This film concerns purportedly nonestablishment types aesthetically and sexually who apparently cannot resist basic romantic needs.

She was excited because the box said it was funny. Lucky for us, the propaganda on the boxes never lie.This movie was an exercise in patience.

Then, they meet a nice, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving character an almost perfect guy. We then watch the woman, the annoyingly pretentious artist in her 30s? freak out as she falls in love. So she tries to flee from the nice, intelligent, emotionally mature man and stay with the married man with whom she is been having great but empty sex. She is rude to the man and does everything in her power to drive him away. In the real world, she would have been quite successful. I certainly wanted to flee from her and I was not even in a relationship with her!Although its nice that the man fought for his love, I never wanted her to have him. Nor did my girlfriend She did not deserve him. And, why I wonder, did the director think that the almost perfect guy should be punished by having to win a relationship with her? When the artist was asking the almost perfect guy to leave, we were screaming for him to leave too. There is a problem with a movie when the heroine of the film is so annoying, childish and stupid that you want her to fail.Beyond that, let me say that Andy Dick made me laugh a few times even though his character was also pretentious to the point of annoyance. Regarding the other characters, they were well acted, morally bankrupt and annoying characters.It is a comedy and I can say I did laugh a few times in the film.

First of all, it is a whopping 4 hours long! True, the Kargil war may have had several points that were captured and fought for, but every single one of those battles need not have been shown. So maybe this is a documentary, not a commercial film as advertised. Sure did not seem like it, as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws. The battle sequences were so poorly executed. I am terribly disappointed from the man who gave well done sequences in Border. Each battle was the exact same as the previous. It was so predictable. This might be a spoiler. The whole army marches uphill, five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each they also use the same cussword every time, one of the lead actors is shot, someone yells for a stretcher, the actor says, No, do not get a stretcher. That will take 6 men from the battalion, and then an actor dies. That exact same thing happens over and over and over again. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. The cast of the movie is too big for its own good. Despite such a long movie, none of the characters were well developed. The actresses had the most miniscule roles. They all are dressed and portrayed to be the same. Two of them were weeping synchronized. It was so comical.

The quick summary of this movie is MUST AVOID. JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this movie and did none of these jobs well.The movie tells the story of the attempt by Pakistan in 1999 to capture part of the disputed region of Kashmir from India. Supposedly based on fact, you get a hint from this movie of the difficulty the Indian army had in recapturing the area from the Pakistani troops  who occupied the high ground. But instead of telling what must have been a compelling and heroic story, all this movie does is make the Indian military look laughable and stupid, which I know is not true.I watched this movie with an almost completely Indian audience, who were very patriotic and clearly wanted to like this movie, but also found themselves laughing at scenes that were not meant to be funny.The script was absolutely abysmal. It gave the impression that Mr Dutta knows nothing about how an army operates and was using bad war movies for reference. The result is a script that is brainless and repetitive.The acting from most of the principals was not stellar, but considering the script they were given, I find it hard to criticise them too much. As for the supporting cast, all I can say is that I hope they were amateurs.The editing was also pretty bad. It was pretty hard to follow what was going on for a lot of the time, and music would abruptly end at scene changes.Good things The cinematography was pretty good, although it was hurt a little by the fact that the movie did not appear to be colour corrected the colour balance often varied significantly within scenes. Also, the few songs that were in the movie were quite enjoyable  for the first half a dozen or so verses at least. Unfortunately they went on a LOT longer than they should have.And the worst crime of all? This mess is FOUR HOURS LONG.

How can a machine gun which normally fires at the rate of 600 rounds per minute fire at 110th the speed? How can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive when there are artillery shells falling as close as 20 feet away? How come the artillery shells fall only on either side of the road and not the road itself?Not only did this disrespect for the weaponry appall me, it was the cliched situations and the incongruity of the dialogues which had me screaming murder.

There is no gradual progression from one battle to another. It is just one gunfight after the next with no connection to the overall scheme of the war. The explanatory scenes are awful.

Although it did have a little bit of the chill factor the whole concept of the E.V.O Electronic Voice Phenomena didnot seem believable. This movie did not explain the reasonings for certain occurrences but went ahead with them. The acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion, like many recent thrillerhorror movies.Definitely not a movie I will be buying on DVD and would not recommend anyone rushes out to see it.","label":0},{"index":11142,"txt":"I was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic Private Lessons which portrays the dream of any male teenager.Private Lessons II has NOTHING to do with the title I mention.

Soon after, he is approached by a Dr. Price, an expert in Electronic Voice Phenomena EVP, who claims he is been receiving messages from Jonathans departed wife Anna via sundry electronic gadgets. Is Anna trying to tell Jonathan something? Is this merely a hint of something on a larger cosmic or otherworldly scale? It is good to see Keaton in a leading role, but the story he is stuck with is convoluted and absurd at points; it is as if the movie does not know how to answer any of the questions it brings up, so it just distracts the viewer with new, unrelated questions.Keaton himself is pretty good, convincingly cast as the bereaving widower desperately trying to communicate with his late wife. He is matured quite a bit as an actor, leaving behind the fratfriendly waackyhijinks roles he played 15 or so years earlier. He looks a little craggy, with a perhaps few more wrinkles than one might expect, but he is lost none of the guile and panache that he is shown during his quarter century in Hollywood.So it is not that Keaton turns in a mediocre performance, it is that the script itself is subpar. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot gets more confusing as it progresses, each tortuous path ending in another tortuous path. This is all well and good if the path leads to some sort of acceptable denouement, something that ties more or less everything together and explains... something. But not White Noise; I knew less about what had happened to Jonathan than I did before I would first seen him.Keatons really the only reason to watch this junk, although he gets fine support from Ian McNeice as Dr. Price and Deborah Kara Unger as the requisite love interest.","label":0},{"index":11144,"txt":"I saw the trailer for this film a few months prior to its release, and MAN, did it look scary, Especially how this film was based on a real life phenomenon. I was incredibly interested, and thought that this could finally be a decent horrorthriller film after years if crap. Well you know how movie trailers make a film look better than it is maybe by showing all of the creepy parts or by overdramaticizing certain elements. The advertisements for the movie did both, which lead to my ultimate disappointment.By no means is this the most disturbing movie in years. Hell, I doubt it was the most disturbing movie of that weeks release. This movie takes the whole based off of fact thing too far.This movie was not complete crap. I must admit, it held my interest and Micheal Keaton was believable as a man searching for answers by supernatural means. Other than that, though, this film is one big clich\u00e9. After Johns wife dies, he learns about EVP, which transmits the voices of the dead into everyday electronic appliances. He all of the sudden receives messages from his wife! My God! It is not just his wife reaching him, it is other dead people. Gee, imagine that. A movie about helping dead people. Come on, give me a break! The clich\u00e9s do not stop there. There is also the obligatory clockstoppingatthesameexacttimeeverynight trick and three evil spirits that menace our hero. Not only was the movie clich\u00e9, it Was not SCARY. The film literally had two jump scenes, and those two scenes are almost identical. The ending is horrible, as it leaves the door WIDE OPEN for a sequel. There is also an ending message with a message saying how only 1 out of X voices heard through EVP are threatening, with a nice happy tune playing. Way to break the mood, you guys. Jeez! In the end, if you want another forgettable horror film, see White Noise. The only reasons I could possibly think anyone would watch this film for is that either that the person is a Keaton fan or that they are interested in EVP. Sure, the EVP aspects may be slightly interesting, but I do not like my movie concepts to be shoved down my throat and blown up in my face. This film tries to be scary, original, and disturbing, but it is just the opposite. You know you have a lame movie when the commercials use the ghosts to talk about there film.

But then again I do not think the owners were in a hurry to get it back, as they have not question me about it. Oh well. So I decided to give it a play, as I was in an undemanding mood. After hearing and reading all the bad press on it, I was not expecting anything remotely good, but I was kept entertained for 90 minutes. Well, more so the 60 minutes, as the last halfanhour was pretty much a blur of confusion. The film is nowhere as good as it could have been, but the time breezed by quick enough even though it is a rather tepid supernatural thriller. I thought it was not all a waste. The first hour I found some effective sequences rather interesting and there is a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle stillness and tragedy that haunts you, but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film. That is when the predictably forced jump scares come into their own and somehow it just does not fit in with the context. It becomes rather hectic, loud and very muddled with its MTV style editing and kinetic camerawork that gets to close into the action. I could not understand what was going on within choppy and abrupt climax. The whole explanation how everything fits into the bigger picture is pure hokey. It is a very unsatisfying conclusion because it goes for something big, but hits rock bottom. I thought they did fine job up until that point with the lighting and showy camerawork. Other then the distinctively stark lighting, the score kept this flick atmospherically gloomy. All of it is very slickly done with its glossed up and fancy hardware, which makes it come across as very sterile and empty.You can easily see that the films heart is in the technical components and not in expanding the characters and story. There is just no connection and lasting sentiment within this flimsy material. After a while, it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many bloodcurdling stuff from beyond the grave. It just got rather repetitious watching someone watch a fuzzy TV screen after while. The E.V.P machine was the star on the show. Well, it did have more impact than the limp performances. Michael Keaton is more than capable actor, but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed John Rivers. He really deserves much better, though. Everyone else is pretty brittle and forgettable. Not because of the performances, but of the lack of depth in their characters. This clunker was not bad to begin with, but it does go pear shape by falling away drastically.I would not care to see it again and I would not recommend to anyone, unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of Hollywood produced horrorthrillers. It is just a damn shame that this overproduced flick could not put it together successfully, as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand. I did not hate it, but what a disappointment.","label":0},{"index":11146,"txt":"I do not think I have ever been so bowled over by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life as i was when i walked out of this piece of crap.

I was surprised to find myself growingly increasingly fatigued as the plot wore on and my staticinduced headache increased. I found White Noise to be preposterous beyond our best efforts of suspension of disbelief. Even after witnessing the harrowing ordeal sustained by Michael Keaton, I was totally unaffected by his demise. Up until the credits I diligently awaited for somethinganything of substance to connect me to the characters story, but such relief never came. Sure, there were the occasional heartstopper moments, but only because loud noises tend to do that to the dozing viewer.While the acting was lame, Michael Keaton may have played his studliest role to date. Perhaps the only redeeming quality that White Noise has to offer is the stunning archietecture in both of Keatons abodes.

The plot is ridiculous, the characters poorly developed, and the premise irritatingly stupid. It all begins when Michael Keaton, fresh off of doing nothing noteworthy since Batman, loses his beautiful author wife, Anna, to a car accident, possibly caused by her driving one of those convertible VW bugs even though she is supposed to be rich. In his grief, Batman moves to a new apartment and takes up a hobby recording nothing and then watching it. He learned this from a really fat pathetic guy who got murdered by three tall shadowy fellows who lived in his TV. Pretty soon, he starts to see dead people, thanks to EVP, or Electronic Voice Phenomenon, which is evidently this deal wherein dead people can send messages to living people through tape recorders, video cameras, dead cell phones Anna cell calling? But she is...DEAD!...Must be ghosts. Mhmmm. No other possible explanation. I would better start messing around with this indiscriminately. etc. Why they cannot just write something down on a piece of paper or knock over some stuff to form creative pictograms is never explained. ANyway, eventually Batman discovers that he is actually seeing the future, and he decides to go help this woman he does not know. He gets out of his house just in the nick of time, because the tall dark guys enter just after he leaves Dmn it!

Just then some detectives show up and save the lady. After Batmans funeral, he decides to send a message from beyond the grave apologizing to his son for being an idiot, evidently feeling that the best way to protect his kid from the horrors of EVP is to expose him to it.

It tried to be another Sixth Sense or Stir of Echoes, and failed miserably. It has a very promising start, but the middle just drags on repeating itself, and ends with a completely poor twist which any monkey could have figured out.

As a man whose wife has recently died, he becomes obsessed with her wandering spirit in the afterlife not a new idea, apparently getting contacted by her through that funky electrical fuzz business you see on your television screen when there is nothing being broadcast.The idea of spirits communicating via the airwaves is called EVP Electronic Voice Phenomena and there are a lot of people who actually believe in it for real, so I am not going to make any comments about what I think of that, or them. Let me just say that I am all for suspension of disbelief when it comes to buying into fantastic films like this, but what I cannot tolerate is not understanding what the hell was supposed to be taking place, which is about where I was left stranded when the credits finally began to roll. Much static indeed.There are occasionally movies like this that have me completely baffled, but if a film fails to make itself clear for me, I tend to consider that to be the fault of the filmmaker, not my own unless I watched it while I was too tired to focus or something.

Okay, got that out of the way, let me say something more substantive.I have seen Ashes of Time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly revered wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director, Wong Kar Wai. Well, despite of all of that WKW has not succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of wuxia fans; mostly it is just shots of dripping water, beads of sweats, legs of horses running, etc. I could not sit through most of the movie.Fast forward many years later when I wanted to give Mr. Wongs movies another shot after hearing many praises, especially from Cannes. I was intrigued by his latest, 2046. A friend told me to start w Chungking Express because it is his most accessible movies. So wrong! I was just p.o. that I got duped into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness. Some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city, blah, blah, blah. It is all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it. But no, he merely shows what is. Faye Wongs acting is very typical of Hong Kongs style garbled enunciation, deer in the headlight wide eye expression, try to be cute and girlish kind of acting; the rest of the cast is equally uninspired.I think the word, Auteur, is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different, which is to be applauded, but not one who has not yet mastered the art of cinematic story telling, which is what Mr. Wong is, for the last 17 years!","label":0},{"index":11156,"txt":"This film is another example of the curse of east Asian cinema two or more separate stories rolled into one film.

It is an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialog a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers the stunning revelation that tears can be dried with a tissue, but water takes time to mop up. The same character is also seen carrying on a deep, meaningful rapport with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. The shaky, wandering, handheld camerawork was another annoying feature I could have done without.

In the first half, a really dull reggae tune is played about three times when once is too often. But in the second half, The Mommas And The Papas California Dreamin is played at least seven times, usually at top volume.

An overt avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional hallmark of auteurs like Karwai Wong and Tarantino, but to me it comes across as Andy Warhol warmed over.

He could have won the Academy Award for this performance, which would have given him two in a row, as he won it for playing Louis Pasteur the year before. My own opinion is that while he tended to overact a bit, I still think he was one of the great actors of the Golden Age. Whatever part he played; you were riveted to the screen watching him.Unlike the Pasteur role, I thought this story smacked of a little too much of what we have seen in the last 60 years going overboard to make a Liberal hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood could not suppress its disdain for police or for the military, here making it a point to tell us how corrupt those organizations are. Filmmakers just love it when authority is challenged and defeated. In that regard, this film is way ahead of its day since we have seen this bigtime since the 1960s.However, it must be noted the facts support this story.

The part that makes this a movie, a continually evolving story, involves a bankrobbing clan without a cause called the Alarm Clock. These scenes are almost painful to sit through. This part was scrapped from the original scripts for Anchorman.The majority of other scenes involving our Channel 4 news team are clearly alternatedeleted takes on scenes from Anchorman. They go to the same party as in the original, the same original group bitching about having a woman on the team scene, and the same cat fashion show segment that Veronica had objections to reporting.Burgundy recreates their first date with the drivein spot overlooking San Diego and dinner at his favorite club, Tinos. Neither character make mention that they have been to the drivein spot before and when Burgundy walks into Tinos with Veronica, he introduces it to her as though they have never been before. Oh, and they are wearing the same clothes as on their original date.Still, I have to give some credit to the filmmakers  even if WURB is nothing more than a clever way of presenting deleted scenes tied together with narration. Between the two Ron Burgundy stories  this is the weaker one. Looking back on it, it is quite a feat for Anchorman to have risen from the ashes of WURB. You stay classy, IMDb.

The kind of bad that makes you wish you could get that time back in your life, the kind of bad that makes you think what on Earth were they thinking to film this in the first place, the kind of bad that makes you wish you would taken 50 more minutes when stepping into the kitchen to grab a snack during the film, the kind of bad that makes leprosy look fun, the kind of bad that makes you think you wish you rented a Pauly Shore film instead....seriously, I cannot explain how very bad this was.Having said that....there were some semiamusing laughs, but they are all so much LESS funny than Anchorman. Sure, they tried to make it entertaining and fun, but the entire subplot that was left out of Anchorman that made it here was genuinely left out for a good reason...it was not even a little bit good.Do yourself a favour or in the USA, a favor, and do not watch this DVD...it will tarnish the good movie that Anchorman is and you do not want to do that.Okay...I am alright now.","label":0},{"index":11169,"txt":"I loved Anchorman; The Legend of Ron Burgundy and hoped this would be just as funny, but alas, it was not. Some bits are excellent though. I thought the sports guy, Champ Kind, professing his love for Ron Burgundy in the car filled with the other members of the news team was hilarious. Everyone is ignoring him and he just gets louder and louder and finally kisses Burgundy which does not get acknowledged either. But on the whole the story does not gel. It is a noble attempt, however, to salvage the unused bits from the first movie, including an entire plot about some pretty benign wouldbe domestic terrorists called The Alarm Clock. Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines, but basically this unused plot line has good reason to be unused in the first movie. The extras on this disk are pretty good, with the best two being the filmed rehearsals featuring lots of improv comedy, and the faux commentary with Will Ferrell and an exec producer who Ferrell discovers early on was not even a part of the movie in any way, shape or form. Turns out he is just a guy who walked in the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer.

The pace and editing are a perfect introduction in an ensemble piece, even better than say Gosford Park. Then it inexplicably slows down, loses focus and starts resembling a traditional French movie only to regain focus in the end with the love relation between Antoine Depardieu and C\u00e9cile Deneuve. In the middle there are too many sidelines and loose ends in the story, several threads started are not ended.SPOILERS AHEAD The main story is the relation between Antoine and C\u00e9cile. He has been loyal to her after his relation with her many years ago, despite her remarrying and setting up home in Morocco. As builder he now rebuilds his own life and recovers hers by taking the mask of C\u00e9ciles marriage. Having accomplished this, he is buried after a freak accident literally and becomes a comatose. He wakes only after she has burned their old picture as indication that they have reconciled with the past and can properly start their lives again together. END OF SPOILERSIt remains unclear what vision this director wants us to see us because there are so many other stories here Illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, there are frequent radio broadcasts about the overthrow of Iraqs former regime. C\u00e9ciles child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs loyalty once he meets his boyfriend, whereas the girl he lives with seems to be sick of that?. Her sister is traditional Islamic, and enters a relation with C\u00e9ciles husband. It portrays Morocco as unnecessary backward, despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through that almost glorifies the past. It portrays Islam as backward and prone to extremism, which may sometimes be true, but certainly not in general. In the end it can all best be described as adding some couleur locale and lart pour lart.Deneuve and Depardieu are great. With this material they are so familiar they are able to spin something extra in every scene lifting an eyebrow, body language, radiating pride, awkward behavior.

It started out interesting enough watching the villain if you can call him that watching the neighborhood kids and writing in books about who is naughty and nice, but after awhile you are looking for some action and this movie does not deliver. You need character development, but this goes overboard and you are still never sure why the heck the guy snaps. About an hour in he kills three of four people while a whole crowd watches in terror, and the guys he kills are not even his targets they are just making fun of him. This is one of many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to knock of the naughty. He then proceeds to try and kill this other guy, and he tries to break into his house by squeezing himself into the fireplace. He promptly gets stuck and barely manages to get out. He then enters through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by smothering him in his bedroom. He cannot seem to kill the guy this way so he grabs a star off the tree and slits the guys throat. What the heck was a tree even doing in the bedroom in the first place? Oh yeah, the killer before this kill stopped off at a party and had some fun too. Well that is about it except for the town people chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and that tune he wants to play. What was that even about?

Wrong! The movie actually handles about a bloke named Harry Stadling; who is obsessed with Christmas, works in a rubbish toy factory and considers it to be his responsibility to determine on Christmas Eve who deserves presents and who deserves punishment. Harrys issues all started when he witnessed Santa \u0096 his daddy in a costume obviously \u0096 caress his mommys naked legs at a tenderly young age. After that he just developed into a social outcast, much to the irritation of his younger brother, who is bound to snap one holiday. I fully understand why certain fans appreciate this slightly eccentric horror movie, but did it really have to be so boring? There are several overlong and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens. I can forgive the shortness of gore and outrageous bloodshed, but this movie does not even benefice from an unsettling atmosphere or unexpectedly demented plot twists with the notable exception of the finale, I must admit. Also, I would have taken the concept more seriously if the crazed protagonist would focus himself on lethally punishing the naughty children! He does not and exclusively kills misbehaving adults.

Dressed up as Santa he finally goes on a killing spree. Also a strong word, since only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects. No tension, no thrills, no gore, no cast. For one exception that is Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is best known for playing aside Tom Hanks as one of the guards in the classic The Green Mile. He still must be kicking himself these days for ever accepting the role. He truly is the only one who really can act, his supporting role is better than the main lead. who also is not that bad, but if you are overshadowed by a little supporting character, you are not great either.. And what about that strange ending ? you have to see it, to believe it. Christmas Evil is downright boring, nothing happens and the artwork is just misleading. This is not a slasher. You wanna see a real Christmas slasher, check out the all time greatest Silent Night, Deadly Night.","label":0},{"index":11195,"txt":"I love the 80s slasher flicks and I remember when Silent NightDeadly Night was pulled from our theaters, I was very disappointed, so I was very excited to see some of these on Fear.net.

The quality of the special effects were laughable by todays standards, the character development too long, but all in all it was laugh out loud funny! The scenes where he loses it because Santa, aka dad, is feeling up his mom and later when the mob is actually shown lighting torches  not flashlights as you would in the 80s, but real torches!  really tickled my funny bone. However, the scenes where he was checking on the kids in his neighborhood gave me a creepy feeling of a different nature. I also enjoyed trying to figure out who some of these character actors were.

But when Stewart discovers an aboriginal womans body floating facedown in a river, things appear to have turned out for the worst. The largest casualty of the weekend is the mens commonsense. They do not hike out of the ravine, and instead finish their fishing weekend with some great catches. Then they head out and report the body.The town and the mens lives quickly turn into a mess. The local media swarms them, and accusations of aboriginal prejudices rear up from the local natives. Stewarts wife Claire Laura Linney, THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE senses the deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did, but has to battle with it through her own mental illness.Amidst all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle, splayed out on a morgue slab. Her murder and subsequent dumping into the water are symbolic of what lay beneath the town of Jindabyne a division of men and women, black and white, social and outcast.The only other people who seem to understand some of what is going on are two young kids Stewart and Claires son who is being led around by a halfbreed Aussie who is mother was killed also just a few years before. The young girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to let go of her mother the best way she can, and the discovery of a new body seems \u0097 strangely enough \u0097 a method in which to accomplish this again, the underlying current of Jindabyne is surmised.Everything and everyone in this Jindabyne township feels what lurks beneath its surface, yet none of them are willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old town of Jindabyne under its surface. None, that is, until Claire forces them to.The movie is interesting if a bit too convoluted. There are far too many story lines that needed exploring and it just does not get done; too many loose threads. The acting was okay, but the filming was terrible. Wobbly cameras, grainy or dark shots, and just a generalized sloppiness hurt the overall production.I enjoy symbolic films, NORTHFORK being one of my alltime favorites in that vein.

As many others have said there are so many inconsistencies and so much of this film just does not ring true. The reaction of the 4 men switches from shock, horror on finding the body to complete indifference whilst they fish. Surely if they were the type of men that would go on happily fishing, then they would have just reported the body and said they had only discovered it after their fishing trip....why on earth tie the body to a tree, go fishing and then tell everyone you found the body 2 days previously? Its so hard to watch a film knowing that the behaviour of the main characters is so inconsistent. As for the rest of the townsfolk, well you would think at least one of them might show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman! The body itself, naked except for the knickers....what scenario leads to that? If she was raped then why still the knickers? If she was raped with the clothes on, then why remove them afterwards bar the knickers? If she was not raped, then why take all her clothes off bar the knickers....leaving yourself with evidence to dispose of? I truly cant think of any realistic scenario that would lead to that other than killing someone to steal their clothes so you can fill up your jumble sale stall!

After 2 hours, I asked myself was there a point to this, or was it just to see the characters struggle with accusations of racism and stupidity of how they handled the discovery?

The viewers outside of Australia must think we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders. Wolf Creek and this film would encourage this perception.

Jindabynes political intolerance is beyond unforgivable... it does not see people as individuals, but rather, as members of categories.This is the most patronisingly offensive Australian movie I can recall ever and it is up against some pretty stiff competition!. A message movie, every tired theme beloved of the trendy left is there Aborigines are victims; white men are violent or alcoholics; white women are not that bad particularly if they are lesbians  but they are most likely of a depressive nature.Four men who go away fishing, find the body of a murdered woman Aboriginal, naturally and leave her in the river for several days while they catch trout. It is a strange decision taken with almost no discussion, as if the men are animals. The one man who briefly demurs is the goodie... we know this because he is living with a bisexual woman  he likes to hold his baby a lot  and eventually moves to a more fashionable costal location away from all these beastly bushdwellers.This is a film made by those trendy urbanites who live in fear of the Australian landscape and those evil rednecks who reside within. It is ignorance of country life is almost as shocking as its contempt. The film is shot through with longdistance views of the bush backed by foreboding, mysterious music. It is made very clear by the end that Aboriginal people are the only ones at home in this landscape. It concludes with an excruciatingly implausible scene of blackwhite reconciliation.In Jindabyne, country life is reduced to little more than a backdrop for a story that by implication proclaims the superiority of the values of enlightened leftist urban dwellers over those of other Australians.This film was not made by people with real jobs but funded by the Governments Film Finance Corporation. It is a product of the artsy set, that soulless void populated by the beautiful people for whom lavish government funding sustains these patronisingly offensive projects which are as detached from real life as possible, as opposed to actually making popular films people want to see.

I was really looking forward to it, as I thought Lantana was great.The following review may contain spoilersFirst, the good things it looks great, some of the performances are OK. The bad things are everything else about it. The story, as you possibly know, is about some blokes who go fishing and discover a body, with the twist that they find it on Friday but continue fishing and finally report it on Sunday when they get back into mobile cell phone range. However the film takes it is time boy does it take its time getting to this central event.Of the ensemble of characters about a dozen, not one seems to like another one which is, I suppose, consistent, because they are all unlikable. I was extremely frustrated by the failure to adequately explain how the characters are related, and it was not until near the end of the movie that I could vaguely construct the family tree. It is hard to think of a film us unrelentingly grim, which is a failure in the structure of the story, as the characters lives seem just as bad before the fishing trip as after. Once you have set the bar so high, it is hard to upit short of everyone committing suicide.There are silly lapses in logic. The killer dumps the body in the lake, and then it somehow drifts miles upstream into the mountains. The fishermen walk out Sunday morning, but for some reason Byrne gets home late at night after his wife has gone to bed. Then first thing the next morning the cops bang on the door to get him to come down to the station. Um, they have not heard of the telephone? Down at the station, the media know the whole story, less than 24 hours after they reported the body?Totally missing from the story is the debate the blokes surely had after they find the body. This is a mystery  everyone asks them how could you do that? and the audience is asking the same question. The debate about what to do with the body is the key scene in Deliverance. I know exactly what I would do in their situation. Someone needs to walk out to the car, drive to mobile range, call the cops, wait, and them guide them back to the location. If the others wait at camp and fish, who cares?A lot of all this just seems false. The only thing that rung true was that, as the girl was black, the local aboriginals seized on the fishermens actions as racist  would not have done it if it was a white girl. Throughout there is a curious indifference to who might have killed the girl I think the subject is mentioned once, and there is no mystery, as the audience sees the killer in the opening scene.So I am sitting there simultaneously bored and confused, when there is a twist  not in the plot, but the theme. Suddenly it becomes about the quiet dignity of the bereaved aboriginals leading to a ludicrous ending with some incoherent stuff about blackwhite reconciliation. Huh?This is Australian film at its finest, according to The Age.","label":0},{"index":11207,"txt":"There are similarities between Ray Lawrences Jindabyne and his last movie Lantana \u0096 a dead body and its repercussions for already dysfunctional lives. But whereas Lantana offered some hope and resolution, Jindabyne leaves everything unresolved in a bleak way that will leave most viewers unsatisfied, perhaps even cheated.The storyline  the aftermath of a fishermans discovery of a corpse floating in a remote river  is based on a short story by Raymond Carver. It became an element in Robert Altmans classic 1993 ensemble Short Cuts. Lawrence uses this theme for an exploration and exposition of relationships within a small Australian community under stress. The movie poses some moral questions Would you let the discovery of a dead body ruin your good weekend? and more poignantly for Australians Would it make any difference if the dead person was an aboriginal? The acting, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is commendable. And there are elements of mysticism reinforced by haunting music, not unlike Picnic at Hanging Rock.If all this sounds like the basis for a great movie  be prepared for a let down, the pace is very slow and the murder is shown near the beginning, thereby eliminating the element of mystery.

The story lines were thin or nonexistent, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialog, and expressed emotion was absolutely, and totally fake.

That is the problem is not? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance. It should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions, get you interested and invested in the characters. This movie does not have what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. First you do not really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to, I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it is suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. They are not believable in the way they act and interact. Example  Jeffrey Combs as a cop over chewing is gum, frowning and looking intense all the time is not the way to go here. I mean what is that?, he looks like he is on the toilet or something. I loved him in reanimator and the way he was playing the intenseneurotic, unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. But not for this, he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner, it is not natural, I am surprised he did not dislocate his jaw during filming.

There are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences, in fact if the film had decided to explore that terrain more it might have been something better. The actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great too.Although I understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story, it is the mark of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do that. If you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly, then the story is losing you and that is what kept happening to me with this film. Other reviewers have mentioned this here and I do not want to get into spoiler territory, but I will say the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing, not too mention the varying mental age of a character that is only supposed to have experienced a few years of life.All in all, there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically misused hypnotism, but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything special.","label":0},{"index":11213,"txt":"This film is very creepy indeed.

I suppose in the world that gave us Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, anythings possible.No, what is really creepy about this film is the central character, Danny. This unappealing young man, aided and abetted it is true by some ludicrously lax security arrangements and a doctor entirely careless of any notion of professional ethics or patient confidentiality, wanders into the hospital room occupied by what can only be described as a highly vulnerable and defenceless young woman, and on the basis of nothing whatsoever her chronic sleeping precludes from being able to give anything like informed consent imagines himself to have some sort of special relationship with her.Seemingly within days, he has arrogated to himself the right to abduct her, believing completely falsely, as we discover that he is better able to care for her than anyone else, and within minutes of getting her back to his apartment, is sexually molesting her though she is again due to her sleepiness entirely unable to consent or resist.Our suspicions as to why he would feel this connection are pretty soon confirmed. He is of course more or less unable to form any mature adult friendships, let alone sexual relationships, so instead falls back on this essentially infantilised woman, who because of her permanent sleeping has a mental age corresponding to a lived experience of only a few years. The scene where she discovers ice cream is particularly cringemaking, and the coyly knowing look she gives him when he gloatingly says he will have to clean her up again causes a particular shudder of horror. But again, I am afraid, not that shudder of horror the film makers were hoping for, but a much more straightforward spasm of revulsion. We can all see clearly what is on the end of our forks here  it is the paedophiles perfect dream of innocence, sexual compliance and utter dependence. Horrible, horrible, horrible.What else have we got in this mish mash? Twisted dreamscapes not quite as good as del Toro.

Annie Mcenroes reaction to being told that her sister presumably Dee Wallace from the first movie is was? a werewolf is, if I recall, along the lines of; Oh! Really?.

Case in point, look at two of the segments in the film, one where Ethan Hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexytalk, and another with Orlando Bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two Dostoyevsky books. While the latter is not a great story by any stretch, it is at least something that has a beginning, middle and end, as the composer tries to score, gets Dostoyevky dumped in his lap, and in the end gets some help and maybe something more from a girl he is been talking to as a liaison between him and the director. The Ethan Hawke scene, however, is like nothing, and feels like it, like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in or, for that matter, Hawke with a combo of Before Sunrise and Reality Bites.What is irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible stories and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another i.e. bits involving Bradley Cooper, Drea DeMatteo, Hayden Christensen, Andy Garcia, James Caan, Natalie Portman, etc. It is not even so much that the film set practically always in Manhattan and not the New York of Queens or Staten Island or the Bronx not even, say, Harlem or Washington Heights lacks a good deal of diversity, since there is some. It is the lack of imagination that one found in spades, for better or worse, in Paris Jtaime.

Anyway, this film should have borne the subtitle Your Movie Is A Turd \u0096 being astoundingly inept in all departments beginning with the allimportant werewolf makeup! The plot and dialogue is not only terrible, but it has the limpest connection with Dantes film \u0096 strangely enough, the author of the original novel Gary Brandner cowrote this himself! Still, one of the undeniable highlights er...low points of the film is the pointless elliptical editing \u0096 which tries to give the whole a semblance of style, but only serves to accentuate its embarrassment factor! Similarly phoney and grating are the hokey transitions between scenes, the inane punkrock theme song, and the cheapjack specialeffects at the climax! What about the characters, then? Lee is the werewolf expert, naturally, whom everybody thinks a crackpot \u0096 until they come into contact with the monsters, that is; at the very least, though, one has to admire the makers ingenuity or gall in devising a stupid subtitle with a dual meaning! Incidentally, Sybil Danning as Stirba, Werewolf Bitch \u0096 the subtitle by which this is known in the U.K.! is quite fetching in an assortment of outrageous SM outfits...but her character is virtually given nothing to do except preside over her brood of followers and engage in the occasional hilarious threeway lycanthrope sex!; her two snarling lieutenants one of them a sluttish black girl are especially irritating.Aiding Lee on the side of good are the two yuppie heroes he being the brother of the Dee Wallace character from the first film and she a colleague of hers and a ragged guerrillatype band of Transylvians still, they generally manage to effortlessly overcome Dannings rather dumb werewolves!. Notable among them is a knifethrowing dwarf who gets a particularly nasty but, at the same time, sidesplitting demise; he is later revived, under Stirbas control, in order to lure Lee by making childish taunts at him all through the village streets into a trap. The latter scene has to be a career nadir for the distinguished and imposing actor \u0096 well, either this or the early sequence in a discotheque where Lee is made to don a pair of ultracool sunglasses so as to appear inconspicuous among the partying youngsters!In the end, if I were forced to mention elements in this which were not entirely displeasing, I guess I could say that the ossuary set in which the heroine is to be sacrificed is interesting, or that the hybrid werewolfbat creature Dannings pet who likes to inhabit the body of its victims is just too weird to be despised...","label":0},{"index":11223,"txt":"to be honest, i did not watch all of the original howling, but those scenes i saw made it obvious that the first howling was a great movie. so great, that seven horrible sequels had to be made. they started off with Howling II Your Sister Is A Werewolf. i got this movie on VHS from my uncle sometime ago when he was giving away a bunch of old movies he bought back when Atari was brand new. i just watched it last night, and it was not really BAD, it was just weird. i mean, the whole thing with Sybil Danning going threeway with two of her werewolf minions was just out of place and quite disturbing but kinda hot, Christopher lee about to stab a dead karen as if she is a vampire, etc. actually, this movie was actually like some sort of mishmash of Dracula and The Lost Boys...except with werewolves, because everything Christopher Lee whom played Dracula himself was saying about werewolves pretty much ripped off from every other vampire movie stake in the heart, garlic, the creature of the night must die AT NIGHT, and the ruler of werewolves lives in TRANSYLVANIA. not much for the acting, but the worst of it came from Annie McEnroe. i swear, at some point in the film i found myself rooting for the werewolves to rip her throat out, because that damn throat always had to say SOMETHING. Anyway, the plot is pretty silly and clich\u00e9d, so there is no real point in telling you, you could just read about it on Wikipedia. By the way, the thing that really makes me nauseous about this movie is the fact that it is the ONLY film out of all the seven sequels thats related in any way to the original not counting Howling IV 1988, which was a remake of the original, or in other words, a sequel based on the same novel. so do not see this movie. there is no real horror, hardly any werewolves, and just horrible special fx. 310","label":0},{"index":11224,"txt":"In the first Howling, we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized.

Whether it is the transformations or the bad puppets or the cheesy computer graphics showing the superpowers.The plot line is not all that bad; they must kill the leader of the werewolves for some reason. This will not destroy all werewolves and it really does not end the threat from werewolves as it...they just want to kill her. I think there was some cloudy reason for this but it really gets lost in the film.After the film ends we have a 10 minute montauge of the movie we just watched and every other scene is one where the female werewolf leader rips off her top exposing her large breasts while some Devoesquire band plays to a crowd of werewolves.

I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee was doing in this movie, however I read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before, but still read the script before you take a role. Maybe you could have gotten into An American Werewolf in London hell that could have been possible. It was set in London after all.

He said something to the effect that his only brush with lycanthropy was The Howling II, then he quipped, The less said about that the better. Indeed he was right as this film may very well be the worst in his entire catalog of screen performances. The first Howling by Joe Dante was a groundbreaking werewolf film with its incredible special effects and its campy sense of style and subject matter. It was a film to be taken seriously. Like other good original films, filmmakers for some strange reason thought that even more campy sequels were needed rather than what worked the first timeSee CHUD then CHUD II to illustrate this point. This film is miles and miles away from the first on every front. There is absolutely nothing scary about it. It looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the major scenes. Lee is the only actor in the film worth mentioningokay, I will cede Ferdy Mayne too. Lee looks embarrassed as he says inane dialog and does ridiculous thingscheck out that ending with him and Stirba. Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what dreck this is which is a tad more insightful than the two leads who leave America to go to Romania. The story is not really worth examining here, and you can bet there is very little story worth mentioning when you have to have Stephen Parsons and his band Babel play through much of the film in the beginning and the ending with that dreadful noise. Sybil Danning is here and, yes, she disrobes once and then we get that scene showed again and again and again  one reviewer said 17 timesI counted ten  but might have been so bored out of my mind by that point.

The Howling is one of the two or three ONLY good werewolffilms ever made and yet it got rewarded by a series of obnoxious and unendurable sequels like this one. If it is any consolation, Stirba is a sequel in name only and there is absolutely no connection with the characters or events that were introduced in Dantes film. The plot here revolves on a bloodthirsty cult of Transsylvanian werewolves \u0096 primarily female ones \u0096 led by Stirba. Stirba is played by Sybil Danning who transforms from a curvy old lady into a blond superbabe with impressive bosom in the blink of an eye and becomes all hairy when sexually aroused. Her archenemy is played by a seemly fatigue Christopher Lee. His character \u0096 Stefan Crosscoe \u0096 is an occult investigator who travels to Stirbas kingdom, accompanied by an American couple who lost their friend to the werewolf cult. In case you are exclusively looking for filthy gore and gratuitous nudity...this is your film. Even the smallest killing is shown in great detail and we are even treated to exploding eyeballs and the vile image of a dwarf who gets pierced on a pointy fence. However, if you want a little substance or depth, you will be sorely disappointed. The dialogues are embarrassing and there is absolutely no tension to detect anywhere. The scriptwriters constantly seem to confuse werewolves with vampires the Transsylvanian setting, garlic, wooden stakes... and Dannings gorgeous balcony is shamelessly exploited as the films only gimmick. During the endcredits, a shot in which she rips off her top, is reedited repeatedly according to my fellow reviewer Dr. Gore, no less than seventeen times! which is pretty pathetic and pointless. The music is okay and some of the scenery is rather beautiful. I am talking about the fiercelooking statues during the opening credits and the dark dungeons of Stirbas castle.

Secondly, several segments feel underdeveloped to me. Like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition. I am not talking about happy endings here or even an ending period but rather, they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in.

The baddies in this film are furry and do not like silver but in every other respect they behave like vampires. Now you just cannot do that with a crappy genre flick, you have got to stick to the rules of the genre or the fans get all confused and annoyed by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing. In fact the whole confusing and poorly presented plot is something that has already been done for vampires, but does not make any sense in a werewolf movie.Secondly, the werewolf costumes are the lamest you have ever seen. Anybody in the werewolf movie business ought to know that the werewolf costumes and transformations are something the fans assess critically, yet some of these werewolves are just plain goofy.There are a couple of slightly good bits. I actually quite liked the score. Others have mentioned Sybil Dannings tits. And...SPOILER, if such a thing can existI also quite liked the plan for attacking the werewolves stronghold. There are so many horror movies that rely on characters behaving stupidly, but in this case they first acquire a very sensible and effective antiwerewolf arsenal and go slaughter the monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver bullets, and we have some pretty powerful firearms these days. Should not be too hard to put two and two together, hmm?

This film had potential. Beneath all of the sludge there are the remnants of what could have been crafted into a decent film, if not an interesting one. The final product is a real mess, however. Aside from the gratuitous nudity and some very attractive women, Howling II winds up being a laughable excuse for a horror film. Christopher Lee gives it a nugget of credibility, but even he cannot raise it above the level of crap.Having never seen any of the other films in this series, this critic will be forced to accept on face value that this is a genuine continuation of the events in part one. We start off at a funeral for one of the characters from the original, and within the first ten minutes we find ourselves in Transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to battle a coven of werewolves. The film is paced fairly well, and there are not too many dead spots. The action is there; it just is not filmed well. One bright spot is the music of a punk band called Babel. Though their song is played quite often, it is rather catchy.The problems with this film are great in number. First off, the acting is worse than pitiful. Christopher Lee is good enough, but that is where it ends. The two leads Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe are lacking in just about everything you would want for such characters. The writing is wretched, the editing redundant, and the direction amateurish. There are a couple nice special effect gimmicks, but the cheesy ones far out weigh them in number. Sybil Danning is nice to look at, but her acting performance is less than satisfactory. Judd Omen looks the part he plays, but his voice and acting are unconvincing to say the least. Much of the dialog is in an unintelligible language that may or may not be Latin.I liked the general idea for the story. I always enjoy stories of true believers out to battle seemingly invincible forces of evil. One scene where a small group of good guys are trekking through a dark forest and shooting down a bunch of werewolves is even kind of exciting. Kind of. Maybe a bigger budget or a better director could have made the rest of the film a bit more compelling. 3 of 10 stars.The Hound.Side note As of this writing, the censors at youtube.com have still not taken down the ending credits with Sybil Danning ripping off her top several times while the Babel song is playing!

And I saw her sip upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden challis full of the filthiest fornications and upon her forehead was written, behold I am the great Mother of an inaudible word I could not make out no matter how many times I rewound the tape and tried to, sorry and all abominations of the Earth.

After the ceremony Karens brother Ben Reb Brown is spoken to by an occult investigator called Stefan Crosscoe Christopher Lee who says that Karen is a Werewolf and that she will come back to life. Ben dismisses such nonsense. But together with one of Karens friends and colleagues Jenny Annie McEnroe he visits Stefan at his home. There Stefan tells them about Werewolves and how they can be killed, he mentions Stirba Sybil Danning who is the queen of Werewolves. Stefan also shows them a photograph taken at Karens funeral of a woman named Mariana Marsha A. Hunt and that she is an extremely vicious and dangerous Werewolf who wants Karen. Stefan says he will stake any Werewoves through the heart with titanium. Ben figures out that Stefan means he will stake Karen as well so together with Jenny he travels to the graveyard where his sisters crypt is to stop Stefan. However lots of Werewolves turn up and attack Stefan, Ben and Jenny. They survive the attack and manage to find out that Stirba is to be found in Transylvania. They all decide to travel to Transylvania and stop Stirba and her Werewolves from taking over the Earth by fulfilling a centuries old curse. Once there they travel to a small town called Vlkava which means where wolves live and meet up with the local priest, Father Florin Ladislav Krecmer and his small but loyal group of Werewolf hunters, hey what else can I call them? Oh, and a dwarf named Florica Ludmila Safarova helps too. They follow Mariana who they hope will lead them to Stirba. But Stirba knows of Stefans arrival and has plans for him Ben and Jenny. Will Stefan be able to put an end to Stirbas plans for world domination? Will this film get any more bizarre or surreal? Watch it and find out. Directed by Philippe Mora this is one strange mess of a film. It is poorly edited as certain sequences just jump around incoherently. The single biggest problem is the script by Robert Sano and Gary Brandner based on his novel which is all over the place and does not make any sort of sense or introduces us to any proper characters that we like. Luckily it moves along like a rocket and is never dull or boring, unlike the original. Something strange or bizarre is always happening to keep the viewer entertained. Most people will probably hate it, but for those of us who enjoy bad films this is right up there with the best of them. There are Werewolf orgies which are just freaky to watch. We get some cool Werewolf killing weaponry. The sets and locations just seem so out of place and I do not know if this was actually shot in Transylvania but it does not look like what I thought mid 80s Transylvania would. Stirbas castle is part dungeon, part Gothic castle and part modern luxury house. Stirba and her servants costumes are very overthetop, Stirba wears an outfit that looks like it belongs in a SM video and to be fair to her she looks pretty sexy, and her minions wear skimpy leather clothing too. The special makeup effects range from good to poor, a dwarfs eyes explode, someone has their hand ripped off and a priest has some creature emerge from his mouth but this is not a film loaded with gore, although there are plenty of effect sequences with Werewolf transformations and attacks. There is plenty of nudity as well as Stirba and her minions are a real randy bunch of Werewolves! I should also mention the music, the soundtrack is dominated by awful rock music that I hated and I ended up turning the volume down. Acting is weak all round and what on Earth was Christopher Lee thinking about when he accepted this film?! I wonder what he thinks of it. Basically the whole thing is a real mess, but I found it a fairly entertaining mess all the same. Impossible to recommend but it kept me watching through to the end. Speaking of which the end credits run over what appears to be deleted scenes and cut footage, it also features the same shot of Sybil Danning taking her dress off and exposing her breasts probably in excess of 20 times!

Unfortunately, the major is Daman Wayans... so the children are in for a world of annoying, humorless asininity. Can Wayans whip these losers into shape? Can they get him to become a little more human? The film bombs as most Wayans films do, with only a few sparkling moments. William Hickey gets about one minute of screen time, fair too little. This charming old man known best to me as a Tales from the Crypt actor, known best to you as Uncle Louis from Christmas Vacation shines every moment he is on screen, which is not much here.Bam Bam Bigelow also makes an appearance as a biker, which fits him perfectly. I would not mind slightly more Bam Bam, but I think he carried the role of biker about as far as it could be carried for a military film.And then there is the attractive teacher, who someone falls for Major Payne even though he treats the kids poorly, has no social skills and is simply impossible to convert into someone you would want to spend time with. She must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I am not sure which though it would seem stupid since the movie makes it clear she gets out of the house often enough.Wayans had one shining moment a dance sequence where he performs a series of moves including a very nice robot, and with the help of music from 2 Live Crew. This scene was enjoyable but hardly made up for anything else that made this film dog spittle.Seriously, avoid this film. If you want to see a film a bout a loser who helps loser kids become heroes, rent or buy Ernest Goes to Camp. At least he is a lovable loser, and actually funny.

The story starts off well although it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hanging herself. Still he mugs well and carries things along. The death knell is twofold. First of all, if we were to take the amount of time characters spend walking from one room to another or one part of the house to another, it would eat up about a third of the movie. Add to that, Robertsons character sitting up in bed in the blue light, looking confused, that might add another chunk. I agree with those that said a half hour shorter would have made it a pretty decent, though insignificant film. The biggest weakness is just a convoluted plot that, when all is said and done, leaves incredible questions. I am not putting in spoilers, but when it ends, do not think too much.

Unlike the original film, the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quicklyby the time you think are getting into a story, it is over in too many cases. And, the often start up and stop and then begin againwith the stories woven together. As a result, there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure.Sadly, however, while Paris, Je TAime was hit or miss mostly hit, most of New York, I Love You was miss. The stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweetand often quite terrible. It was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional storiesand perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so. Now understand, it was good quality music but its somber tone really, really made me feel like cutting my wrists! Among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom, the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant though this was also in the first film and the crotchety old couple. This is all so sad because I had loved the first film so muchand I really WANTED to love this film. I respected what they tried but simply did not like it very much.By the way, and this is NOT really a complaint, but I was amazed how many people were smoking in the film. For a recent film, that was unusual in our more antismoking culture.Also, if you get the DVD, there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film.

Cliff is forced to carry this movie with his body language for most of the time. He does not do a poor job, but it is a little overmuch to ask of an actor to plug the oceans of blank screen time during which the characters spend their time NOT talking and also NOT acting. Robertsons most memorable role may have been Ben Parker in the last 3 Spider Man movies starring Tobey Maguire.The plot is predictable. A husband murders his rich wife for her money. thereafter the wife seems to comeback and haunt the husband driving him insane until he leaps from a high window fearing the specter of his dead wife approaching him on the day he is predicted to die no less.The second chauffeur Mr Ballard hires looks a lot like an English mark Hamill. Uncanny really! The only thing that stands out is the utter disregard for dialogue. Many minutes pass in quietness, no one speaks, and few act. It is a shame the MST3K guys never got hold of this movie.

Various reviews I have read compared this movie to the likes of those by Wong Kar Wai or Hou Hsiaohsien. i.e. one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years. Unfortunately this is not quite accurate. The film plays out rather like a film school graduates attempt to emulate these masters. All the pieces are there  the beautiful backdrop, the vaguely minimalist dialogue, the slow swaying camerawork, and male leads, in particular, who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative. Sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par. The dialogue is leaden. The acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type; the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving. Unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical Chekovian i.e. very predictable plot, the results are at best tedious and at worst painful. I could not help but see the Blue Danube river scene, for example, as verging on genre parody although the smoggy looking springtime sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour... I actually went to this movie on the basis that Mark Li Ping was photographing it. While the setting is elegant, and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of Flowers of Shanghai, the film is not in the same league, visually. In fact I must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film, I suddenly remembered that I was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave and I cannot recall the last film I walked out of. I am guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point I could not care. If you would like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then I would recommend anything by the above two directors, for example In the Mood for Love or Flowers of Shanghai, both of which were filmed by the talented Mr Ping the former with Chris Doyle, and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this.

Its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film, because there is almost no development in the plot. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry. The acting seems very poor as well, and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime Chinese television. Although this is difficult to tell with the female role, Yuwen, as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of fading star Gong Li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the West for having a scowl on her face all the time. Tian Zhuangzhuangs film the Blue Kite was a far better film. But do not be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a Small Town was set in the late 40s. Unlike the Blue Kite, the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself, the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop.I wonder whether Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeal to a foreign audience who cannot tell the difference between a film that is beautiful profound or hypnotic and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial.If any film fits the description of overrated, this is it.

Being practically the full text of the play is everything this Romeo  Juliet has going for it, lacking in all other departments. Alvin Rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director, both in the technical and artistic aspects. In the former, because he commits mistakes that even a first grade film student would wisely avoid. Take in consideration, for example, the badly edited first shot of Abraham and Balthasar in the opening scene, or the Nurses entering of Friar Lawrences cell, asking where is Romeo with him being so very in front of her that she would clearly see him even if she was blind. And, in the latter, because every single one of the performers is misdirected, even if some of them are good actors. Rebecca Saire looks exactly the way I have always imagined Juliet to look like, and she does not seem to be a bad actress for a teenager, but her performance totally lacks passion of any kind. Patrick Ryecart as Romeo is even worse, being not only as dull as Juliet, but also way too old and not even goodlooking, coming across as a combination of Malcolm McDowell and the Chucky doll. Putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other, let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written. Alan Rickman, in his screen debut, plays Tybalt like if he was Darth Vader, which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that Shakespeare intended, no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings. This Tybalt is so meanlooking that we do not believe the characters pity after his demise. As for Paris, I kept thinking of Prince Valium from Spaceballs. Only Celia Johnson manages to do the character of the Nurse some justice.At 168 minutes, this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters, because the characters do not empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles. The best screen version is still Franco Zeffirellis.

Juliet is almost passable, but she gives no depth to her character,and seems to be completely out of touch with the play. Mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of character for the entirety of his dialog. Benvolio was unfeeling and mercilessly choppy with his lines.

Shoddy direction, stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy.In the town of Verona, the Capulets and the Montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when Romeo Patrick Rycart, a Montague, falls in love with Juliet Rebecca Saire, a Capulet. Bloodshed soon erupts...The studio work, especially in daytime scenes, seriously stagnates the energy of the play. It is a story that, with it is energy, deserves to be shot outdoors. Coupled with this the costumes are hideous, with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces. The stage fighting looks horrendous, with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging.Patrick Ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective Romeo. He manages the characters intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland, often inexpressive eyes limit his range. It is very hard for the audience to relate to this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too youthful to be a good Juliet  she captures the characters naivet\u00e9 but a little more sassiness would have been welcome.The supporting roles do not fare much better. Joseph OConnors Friar Laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut. Anthony Andrews Mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera. He gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result. Alan Rickman, underplaying his role, has virtually no presence as Tybalt. He did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years, but that is not in evidence here. The Prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor Lawrence Naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera.

If I had a dagger, I would have offered it to them hours earlier.Anthony Andrews is unspeakable as Mercutio, a great shock if you remember his fine work in Brideshead Revisited. He breaks the mirror of Shakespeares verse into a thousand shards of two or three words each, and then shouts the fragments in as disconnected and unintelligible manner as possible. In this production, Queen Mab abdicates. Awful.The director, Alvin Rakoff, shows only an intermittent gift of putting the camera where it will show us what we want to see. The opening brawl is notably incoherent. However there is humor when in a later fight, Romeo apparently knees Tybalt right in the cobblers. Tybalt then grabs the offended region.

Gene Kelly and Vincente Minnelli, the team behind An American in Paris, are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations. Genes leading lady is Cyd Charisse, one of the best dancers of 40s50s cinema, and unlike the generally superior It is Always Fair Weather this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances. Lerner and Loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as My Fair Lady and Minnellis musical masterpiece Gigi; Lerner and Minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent American in Paris.What happened along the way? Why is the movie itself such a stupid bore? Minnelli himself did not want to do the movie, despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with Lerner. Maybe it was because the movies innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for MGM and one step backward for Vincente Minnelli. But once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of Brigadoon are trapped within its city limits, Minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting, if not liberating way. The ultimate result is truly horrific to behold.While aiming for the naive charm of previous Minnelli hits like Cabin in the Sky and Meet Me in St. Louis, the plaidtights wearing inhabitants of Brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those neverhavebeen locales. Its whimsy does not even match up to the glossy luster of Yolanda and the Thief or The Pirate because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions. The only people in Brigadoon who I at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellowtraveler played by Van Johnson who accidentally shoots him. The general proceedings in the township of Brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of Christianity they seem positively pagan in their aspect. For example, in exchange for Brigadoons immortality, the honorable and most generally good pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge.At one point we are assured that everybodys looking for their own Brigadoon. Suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us are not looking for this kind of quasiqueasy paradise. The premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing, but could work if the players were perfect. But Kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie, and Charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as Lucille Bremer was miscast in Yolanda and the Thief. Van Johnson does his best version of the classic Oscar Levant sidekick to Kelly even lighting 3 cigarettes at one point like Levant in AIP, and he provides a lot of amusing moments.

Well they had a right to say that if they did, they were probably mad at the fact that Hollywood turned their great musical into this rather blank movie.Song and acting wise Mr. Kelly, you passed the audition with flying colors, but you are in a movie that is missing a lot of the text.So in short, if you want a good movie based on a musical by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this one is not it! 310","label":0},{"index":11273,"txt":"Can fake scenery ruin a picture? You would not think so, but it actually for me in here. Listen, I have a lot of classicera movies and I know pretty much what to except, such as the drivers steering immobile cars in front of a screen, etc. But a lot of that hokey business has to do with action scenes. To have fake scenery, fake mountains and flowers shot after shot as seen in Brigadoon gets insulting after awhile. As far as the music entertainment went, this is always subjective. What songs one person likes, another may not so that should not be a big part of judging a film whether someone likes the songs. I could blast this movie for its corny 1950 songs, dances, romances and characters but that was the 50s and a lot of people liked this sort of things. Musicals did very well in the 50s. Me, I liked the 30s and 40s with the great taps. By the 50s, tap was out and this new stuff  which I can stand  was it. Does that make this a lousy movie? No. It just makes one I did not care for very muchDespite the good cast, good director and high expectations, this film bombed at the box office, and with me. I should have liked it more, being a dreamer myself and that is a nice part of this story. I am not the cynical type and a nice town and nice people making me feel good sounds awful appeal. Then why could not I connect with this film? Part of it also was the dancing. I do not care for the stuff that replaced tap dancing on screen. But  no  the thing really turned me off what that staging. There was no Scotland, no highlands, just a hokey looking background to make it look that way and it turned me almost from the start.

If it is all the same to you the reader though I feel compelled to point out that with the lone exception of Christopher Walken in a returning role as Gabriel this movie is pathetically HORRID. I say this to you to warn you in advance that even if you are a fan of Walkens deadpan delivery and style or liked the original Prophecy that you will be sorely dissapointed. If you buy it, return it. If you rent it, make sure it is only ninetynine cents.What is wrong with this movie? A full list would take too long to read and would bore you to tears, but a short summary would be the following the once rather crystalline clear picture of the relationship between angels and mortals of the first film is ripped to shreds. Gabriel is turned from the rather morbid right hand of God he once was and in this role he is WICKEDLY funny in the first to little more than a thug for heaven. Since Walken is so good at playing heavies we all remember Frank White from King of New York he is still enjoyable but the supporting cast is an unmitigated and unconvincing mess of mortals and angels alike who could not buy a clue for 50 cents. If you can figure out the plot you are a smarter man than I. One gets the feeling we wander aimlessly from scene to scene just to move the film along to Walkens next big line. By the end of the movie you are actually wishing he would blow his horn and make the walls of Jericho fall on the people who made this unnatural disaster.Bottom line  it is an insult to our intelligence that they made a sequel to this film in the first place. The original told the right story, answered the questions that should have been, and left alone the ones you were meant to ponder afterwards. There are no compelling reasons to follow these characters that was in the first  the priest who lost his faith, the little girl who kept the big secret, the teacher who protected her children  even Lucifer himself was more interesting BY himself in the first film than all the other characters in the sequel put together.

Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and even though the film was not flawless, it was a creepy and highly original HorrorFantasy film that entertained immensely. This inferior 1998 sequel is still worth watching, but mainly due to Walken. Walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen Archangel Gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. Once again, the war between fallen and loyal Angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel Danyael Russel Wong and the human woman Valerie Jennifer Beals. This child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war... As I said above, Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. Besides Gabriel, however, The Prophecy II sadly also includes a bunch of terribly annoying characters. The character of Valerie was annoying enough, and Danayel annoyed me even more. The biggest pain in the ass, however was the character of Izzy played by Brittany Murphy, a suicidal girl who would not shut up. Still, Walkens performance is not the only redeeming quality of the film. The entire film is quite dreary, and wellshot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. Gabriels resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the Prophecy films. The Prophecy II is nevertheless the weakest of the three Prophecy films with Walken. Definitely a Christopher Walken onemanshow, entertaining, but nothing beyond that.","label":0},{"index":11282,"txt":"Everybody knows that Gregory Widens original The Prophecy did not really require a sequel, but you also do not need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cashins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable. Part two is a very prototypic example of a straighttovideo sequel, meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action, more witty oneliners and a lot more eerie religious scenery. The only good news is that the producers managed to keep Christopher Walken for the role of Gabriel, and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental. If it was not for Walkens performance and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like Brittany Murphy and Glenn Danzig, The Prophecy II surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release. The movie begins with Gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing War of Heaven here on earth. The purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse Valerie Rosales Jennifer Beals from getting born. For you see, her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly monkey and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of Gabriels evil dominion. Thus, just as in the first movie, he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts Valerie all the way down to the Eden for the final showdown. The Prophecy II is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you do not make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity. Whenever the storyline becomes too tedious, the makers luckily enough always insert a nearbrilliant Christopher Walken moment to distract you. His interactions with the rebellious Izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences. On a slightly offtopic note, I often felt like The Prophecy II ambitions to look similar to Terminator II \u0085 Gabriels resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the Eden location, where the final battle takes place, looks very similar to the steel factory where Terminator II ended as well. Coincidence, I guess?

The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she is more interested in her new girlfriend, and they stumble upon this witch spell book they want to be witches or something??? and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently.

I know it is not the love Crash of anviltastic inclusiveness but you cannot pretend to have a cinematic New York with out these fairly prevalent members of society. Plus, you know the people who produced this ish thought Crash deserved that hamhanded Oscar, so where is everyone? Possibly worse than the bizarre and willful socioeconomic ignorance were the down right offensive chapters remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with pretty young women in wheelchairs?

Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing  all spanning every possible genre ever to concern wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes outside fancy restaurants. But thank god they finally got powerhouses Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson back together for that Jumper reunion. And, side note, Uma dodged a bullet; Ethan Hawke looks ravaged. This, of course, is one thing in terms of his looks, but added an incredibly creepy extra vibe of horribleness to his terrifyingly scripted scene opposite poor, lovely Maggie Q.I had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene for the end of film questionnaire, but it has to be the Anton Yelchin Olivia Thirlby bit for the sheer lack of taste, which saddens me because I really like those two actors. I do not consider myself easily offended, but all I could do was scoff and look around with disgust like someones 50 year old aunt. A close second place in this incredibly tight contest of terrible things is Shia LaBeoufs tone deaf portrayal of what it means for a former Disney Channel star to act against Julie Christie. I do not mean opposite, I mean against. Against is the only explanation. I realize now that the early sequence with Orlando Bloom is a relative highlight. HIGHLIGHT. Please keep that in mind when your brain begins to leak out your ear soon after the opening credits, which seem to be a nod to the first New York Real World. This film is embarrassing, strangely dated, inarticulate, ineffective, pretentious and, in the end, completely divorced from any real idea of New York at all.

A portal was opened containing a world of demons known as the Kelippoth of the Sitra Achra by a man whose daughter, Summer, gets kidnapped by something, taken into it. Summer is trained by a mysterious group whose identities are never revealed to battle the demon monsters. This is a portion of the plot which lends itself to scrutiny. Anyway, three wannabee witches, who went to high school together, Renea, the most enthusiastic, serious practitioner in the dark arts, and her lesbian cohorts, Jasmine and Marlene..it is more or less a passing fad with them, though.. join up with buddies, Jason and Ricky, on a trip in the wilderness where Summer vanished from her home ten years ago. Opening the portal through a spoken text written in an ancient book, a demon is set free, as is Summer, now a warrior babe whose training has led to a very fit and athletic body and skills that have been needed to ward off monsters in the other world.Low budget contains a loopy, but ambitious story, restraining it into a confined setting. These young adults spend a lot of time running around in the woods hoping not to be fodder for a beast. As can be the case in these movies, the demon stands on the sidelines while the story develops as Summer attempts to remember how everything came to pass, while befriending Jason who wishes to help her restore the lost time. The action is shot mostly in the dark, making any violence hard to decipher. Brigitte Kingsleyand the rest of the female cast for that matter, is some mighty nice eye candy, dressed scantily clad as a female Conan, a gorgeous body we have to pleasure to gaze upon from the moment she appears until the closing of the movie. Some lesbianism..some kissing and fondlingand nudity spice things up nicely, and the cast seem to be having fun with the goofy plot..it is so preposterous that the silly tone is probably appropriate for the material.Might be of interest for costarring World Wrestling Entertainments Captain Courageous Christianreal name, Jason Resoas one of the group, spoofing his alter ego, as a chicken, quivering at the sound of a snapping tree twig.

The Kelippoth demon is mostly darkly lit, I guess to refrain from showing how ludicrouslaughable it looks if presented in full. The lesbian antics of Jasmine and MarleneHaley Shannon is mostly tame, their love making, once alone in the woods up against a tree, is toned down and also lighted using the blackness of night. My rating is a bit favorable towards it, almost solely because of Kingsley, for purely superficial reasons, rather than the plot or filmmaking.

One thing philosophers do agree on is that Nietzsche was a great thinker. So making a movie about his life, which obviously includes his ideas is a thing one should be extremely careful with, or preferably, do not do at all. Wisdom starts with knowing what you do not know.

What I liked about Paris was the breakup of the neighborhoods. You got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell. In NY, there is no clear separation of the stories, at different points in the film, characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who I was watching and what exactly was going on. Also, the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flow.Another thing I loved about the Paris film was the different takes on love. It was not all romantic. There was love between parents and their children, unrequited love, a lonely, middleaged woman yearning for love etc., it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans. NY seemed to only go for an edgy, overthetop sexuality. There were some redeemable shorts the older couple having spent a lifetime together, Julie Christies short, but overall theNY film did not evoke any emotion for me. I did not connect with any of the characters like I did with Paris. I remember watching Paris and feeling a deep sadness, loneliness, yearning, hopefulness, wonder... it just had so much soul. For me, there was no soul in the NY film.Maybe if I had gone into it without having Paris looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response, but as a selftitled retake of Paris, Je Taime I was sorely disappointed.","label":0},{"index":11299,"txt":"...but this has to be the worst A Christmas Carol adaptation of all time.

And chew it she does, with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim tying into a Christmas goose.Give me the classics anytime Alastair Sim, 1951.

Here, Ms. Scrooge is a miserly banker who takes advantage of the employees and customers in the largely poor and black neighborhood it inhabits. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. Part of the problem is that storys roots do not translate well into the urban setting of this film, and the script fails to make the update work. Also, the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly, the audience becomes tired of it well before the movie reaches its familiar end. This is a message film that does not know when to quit. In the title role, the talented Cicely Tyson gives an overly uptight performance, and at times lines are difficult to understand. The Charles Dickens novel has been adapted so many times, it is a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant, in spite of its very relevant message.","label":0},{"index":11301,"txt":"Two old men sitting on a park bench .

Her character in the book is sexually beaten up by the young stud, which would never do for the legendary Ms. West.

And it seems like plain suicide on the part of the studio, given that 1 The feuds between the cast were well known long before the movies release. 2 The feud between the ProducerRobert Fryer and Director  Michael Sarne was also common knowledge. 3 The cast made no secret of their contempt for the film and made it public at every opportunity, with daily bulletins from the set gleefully reported by gossip columnists everywhere.And 4 The author, Gore Vidal hated it practically from day one. Nevertheless, that tagline just about sums it up. Raquel Welch does give a decent performance as Myra, and she looks lovely besides. John Huston is very funny as Buck Loner, the exCowboy Star who runs a phony acting academy. Mae West, in her first screen appearance since 1943 naturally rewrote her part to suit herself, and she is great as oversexed and that is putting it mildly Talent Agent Leticia Van Allen. Still, she must have wondered after waiting so long for a good vehicle in which to return how she ever ended up in this mess.Tom Selleck in his film debut is one of her clients. John Carradine and Jim Backus, as Doctors, also amble in briefly. Rex Reed as Myron, Farrah Fawcett and Roger Herren, as the victims of MyraMyrons sexual passion, are neither here nor there. The same goes for the script, which not only fails to focus on the basic plot of the book, but seems to head in at least three different directions at once. Although Wests part was originally larger, she was reduced to a cameo role by the time Sarne was through with the editing. And, partly because of this, she seems to be in a different movie. Apparently, at some point, the Producers realized that Mae was going to be the films big draw, and, unable to replace most of her cut footage, they rushed her back to the set at the end of filming for the second of her two songs, both of which come out of nowhere. The device Sarne used of throwing in old film clips of bygone stars to emphasize whatever points he was making, does not work at all. By the time the movie concludes, all a weary spectator can do is wonder what in the hell it was all about. Not surprisingly, just about everyone connected with the production felt the same way, and it died at the box office. A technically flawless DVD includes, among other extras separate commentaries from both Welch and Sarne, each of whom have completely opposite opinions of just what went wrong.No doubt it is home video rerelease was prompted by a 2001 Vanity Fair piece, which attempted in great detail to do the same thing.

My dissatisfaction is split 30 tonedeafness, 70 lackluster writing.The 30 I agree with the first commenters synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories. I was surprised how, this film, at best, woefully shortchanges the real NYC by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if it is inhabited only by the cast of Gossip Girl this is coming from someone who likes Gossip Girl. A few minority characters are written into the stories, but they are included by obligation, while we can see the gears under the film so clearly, striving to be diverse but falling eversoshort.The 70 is why everything falls short. All characters, white plus a few token minorities, are onedimensional, cardboard cutouts of people concepts. Worse, their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what I would say is a gag we get a basic conceit, then some punchline intended to be a clever twist. But even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say, Okay, that was a surprise...the stories are still not that interesting, because they, too, are shallow. When you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending, you are writing jokes.Spoilers below...The movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories. That is fine. But romance is amazing, deep, sometimes complex. These romantic stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other. Words exchange, thoughts are projected through voiceover, but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to another.Meaning, there is no seduction in the broad sense, no tension, and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the Other. The only story involving a superficial seduction is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy Ethan Hawke gets outwitted by the girl he is hitting on, who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker. Sure, his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as we would be if we were next to them, but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of A then B. So it unfolds, if something like a postcard could unfold, with all the other tales as well A then BThat is It, the only point being that these happen to occur on set in Manhattan. By the way, the only Brooklyn we see is the Coney Island sketch; the only Queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the West Village.It is easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race, gender, sexual orientation, and so on. _New York, I Love You_, however, deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title. We expect to see the real New York, and real New Yorkers, but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic, its characters flown in from The O.C., plus a few others to make it SEEM as if we are paying attention to diversity. But when we look closer at who those characters are, the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to represent.For example, the story with the Latino man with the little white girl in the park, who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny male nanny when in fact he is the father. Notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramaticconstruction point of view it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriendstepfather are strutting the girl away, it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girls father is Latino ALSO must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer. What, the dad cannot be just some guy from South America? Now that he is obviously hot, is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middletoupperclass white woman? Are we that naive as to require such? As if a Mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatable.It is not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone. But in every conceivable setup and plot twist, the direction taken screams status quo, appeals to safety. All these stories could have been made more interesting, even if we were forced to keep the singledimensionality of the characters inhabiting them, at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes. Asian girl living in Chinatown being leered at by a scraggly old white guy? How bout an Asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead. Again, I am not saying the entire conceit has to be changed. It is just that every. damn. story premise. is so hackneyedand thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love New York, outside the trite. The real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth reading.I will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack, the good pacing of the movie even if what was being paced was, well, dredge, and the general feel of many of the scenes. The movie was just fine to sit through, and I would not dissuade anyone from doing so. However, it is telling that the most significant homage paid to nonsuperficiality is when the old opera singer says paraphrased That is what I love about New York everyones from a different place. Well, you would not know it from watching this one.","label":0},{"index":11310,"txt":"It was the Sixties, and anyone with long hair and a hip, distant attitude could get money to make a movie. That is how Michael Sarne, director of this colossal flop, was able to get the job. Sarne is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie. In fact, the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film, a terribly precious 60ship black and white featurette called Joanna. That film starred the similarly talentless actresswaif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or batlike twitter. Sarne, who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon, never mind a bigbudget Hollywood film, was in way over his head. David Gilers book is the best place to go to find out how the fauxinfant terrible Sarne was able to pull the wool over everyones eyes. If there is ever an historical marker which indicates the superficiality and shallowness of an era, Myra Breckinridge provides that marker. It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great seachange in the body politic. Breckinridge is a touchstone of another, equally important vein. Watch this movie and you will get a different perspective on the lessoften mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years.Many reviewers have spoken about the intercutting of footage from other films, especially older ones. Some actually liked these clunky comments on what was taking place in the movie, others found them senseless, annoying, and obtrusive, though since the film is so bad itself any intrusion would have to be an improvement. In my opinion, the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed. That is to say, Sarne was so imaginationchallenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time. They were not inspiration, they were desperation. His writing skills were nonexistent, and David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb, so Sarne was left to actually try and make a movie, and he could not. It was beyond his slim capabilities. Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire films worth of clips. The ghosts of writers and directors  many long since passed on  were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck was not able to. This was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew not to mention the producers and the accountants cooled their heels and waited for something, some great spark of imagination, a hint of originality, a soupcon of wit, to crackle forth from the brow of Zeus. Um, oops. No Zeus  no imagination  no sparks  millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings  each made from the hundreds of licensing agreements required to use the clips  flying out the window. Byebye. As for myself, I hated the film clips. They denigrated Sarnes many betters, poked fun at people whose talents  even those whose skills were not great  far outstripped the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration, originality  and even of plain competency  compared to even the cheesiest of them.","label":0},{"index":11311,"txt":"Anyone who knows me even remotely can tell you that I love bad movies almost as much as I love great ones, and I can honestly say that I have finally seen one of the alltime legendary bad movies the almost indescribable mess that is MYRA BRECKINRIDGE. An adaptation of Gore Vidals bestselling book he later disowned this film version, the starstudded MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is truly a movie so bad that it remains bizarrely entertaining from beginning to end. The Xrated movie about sex change operations and Hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally booed off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of it is release. Not surprisingly, the film went on to gain a nearlegendary cult status among lovers of bad cinema, and I was actually quite excited to finally see for the first time.Director Michael Sarne who only had two other previous directing credits to his name at the time, took a lot of flack for the finished film, and, in honesty, it really does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve. The film is often incoherent, with entire sequences edited together in such a halfhazzard manner that many scenes become nearly incomprehensible. Also irritating is the gimmick of using archival footage from the Fox film vaults and splicing it into the picture at regular intervals. This means that there is archival footage of past film stars such as Judy Garland and Shirley Temple laced into newlyfilm scenes of often lewd sexual acts, and the process just does not work as intended this also caused a minor uproar, as actors such as Temple and Loretta Young sued the studio for using their image without permission.Perhaps Sarne is not the only one to blame, however, as the films screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief. For instance, this film will ask you to believe that the scrawny film critic Rex Reed in his first and last major film role could have a sex change operation and emerge as the gorgeous sex goddess Raquel Welch?! The film becomes further hard to follow when Welch as Myra attempts to take over a film school from her sleazy uncle played by legendary film director John Huston, seduce a nubile female film student Farrah Fawcett, and teach the schools resident bad boy Roger Herren a lesson by raping him with a strapon dildo. Did everyone follow that? And it gets even better or worse, depending upon your perspective! I have yet to mention the films topbilled star the legendary screen sex symbol of the nineteenthirties, Mae West! Ms. West was 77 year old when she appeared in this film she had been retired for 26 years, and apparently she still considered herself to be a formidable sex symbol as she plays an upscale talent agent who has hunky men including a young Tom Selleck throwing themselves at her. As if this were not bad enough, the tonedeaf West actually performs two newlywritten songs about halfway through the film, and I think that I might have endured permanent brain damage from listening to them! Naturally, none of this even closely resembles anything that any person of reasonable taste would describe as good, but I would give MYRA BRECKINRIDGE a 4 out of 10 because it was always morbidly entertaining even when I had no idea what in the hell was supposed to be going on. Also, most of the cast tries really hard. Raquel, in particular, appears so hellbent in turning her poorlywritten part into something meaningful that she singlehandedly succeeds in making the movie worth watching. If she had only been working with a decent screenplay and capable director then she might have finally received some respect form critics.The rest of the cast is also fine. The endearingly overthetop John Huston who really should have been directing the picture has some funny moments, Rex Reed is not bad for a nonactor, and Farrah Fawcett is pleasantly freshfaced and likable. Roger Herren is also fine, but he never appeared in another movie again after this I guess he just could not live down being the guy who was rapped by Raquel Welch. And as anyone could guess from the description above, Mae West was totally out of her mind when she agreed to do this movie  but that is part of what makes it fun for those of us who love bad cinema.","label":0},{"index":11312,"txt":"I have to say I was very curious on viewing this film, and it was considered a notorious disaster when released by 20th Century Fox in 1970. It has also popped up on several critics lists of bad films, and this only deepened an interest, as I just had to see what made this movie so bad.Upon seeing it, I think I have my answers. Although I will say it does make for curious viewing, the acting, direction, and script are so laughingly bad, that the supposed satire is completely missing. Racquel Welch seems to try to carry the film, but after the opening sequence of the sexchange operation, the film goes so far down hill that she cannot handle this task alone. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner is certainly no help, as he licks and leers at the screen, he sometimes looks like he wonders himself what he is doing there. Rex Reed bounces around as Myron, Myras alter ego, and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene. Bravo for debut performances! Farrah Fawcett plays a dumb blonde; she certainly seemed convincing in this role. But , of course, arguably the most notorious role went to Mae west. The sight of a 75 year old woman with a plastic face making sexual innuendos seemed more suitable for a horror film. I do not mean to put this cast down personally; but in this film, no one comes out looking good. The direction seems so unassured and nonexistent, that the film is not only bad, but boring as well. Throw in some old film footage of old stars, and the movie becomes even more disconnected.

It is the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed.I am sure that the first morning of filming Raquel Welch dusted off the shelf over her fireplace to prepare a spot for the Academy Award she would surely win for this daringly original movie. Oops. That is not what happened.The infighting on the set was detailed in print by Rex Reed and this helped the movie attain a reputation before it was even released. When it was finally released there was not the usual three ring circus of publicity. If I remember correctly, in Houston it opened at driveins and neighborhood theatres and never played any of the big venues.I lay most of the blame on director Michael Sarne, who was hot after having directed the not all that good JOANNA, a film with music about young people in swinging mod London.If I recall correctly, Fox wound up firing him and piecing the film together the best they could. That is why scenes play out in no particular sequence and characters appear and then vanish. An impressive supporting cast Kathleen Freeman, Jim Backus, John Carradine, Andy Devine and others is wasted with nothing to do.To expand it to feature length there are numerous clips from Fox movies featuring stars like Carmen Miranda in amazing footage from THE GANGS ALL HERE andLaurel and Hardy, who never dreamed they would be playing in an X rated movie.The X rating is due to occasional language numerous sexual perversions; however, none of the characters seem to be having any fun. Maybe somebody involved with the film had a warped Puritan sensibility and figured that if they could make these things unappealing it was not bad to exploit them.This was one of the youth pictures that nearly bankrupted Hollywood in the 1970s. One writer joked that EASY RIDER which was made for pocket change was the most expensive movie ever made because so many films followed which tried and failed in the worst way to duplicate its success. Sixtyish, once honored directors like Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger made movies like RPM and SKIDOO in an effort to attract a young audience. White directors and writers attempted to make films to attract a Black audience. Those movies are locked somewhere in a vault and the two named and many others from that genre have never, as best I know, been out on home video or cable. They are the studios deep dark secret.Raquel Welchs performance in this is, all things considered, very good. With the right direction and script she could played the type of sassy liberated women Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck specialized in. She looks great and has awesome costumes. Mae West is the liveliest seventysomething actress I have ever seen. On the one hand it is kind of heartbreaking to watch her attempt to capture her glory from years gone by, but I am sure she needed the money.If you want to see a big budget Xrated movie from this era check out BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS also from Fox because it does not take itself seriously.

Now at last on DVD in an unexpectedly handsome package, it is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released. Gore Vidals 1968 bestseller was a darkly satirical statement. Most filmmakers felt that the novels story, structure, and overall tone would not translate to film, and industry insiders were surprised when 20th Century Fox not only acquired the rights but also hired Vidal to adapt his novel to the screen. But studio executives soon had cold feet Vidals adaptations were repeatedly rejected and novice writerdirector Michael Sarne was brought in to bring the film to the screen.Studio executives hoped that Sarne would tap into the youth market they saw as a target for the film, but Sarne proved even more out of synch with the material than the executives themselves. Rewrite upon rewrite followed. The cast, sensing disaster, became increasingly combative. In her DVD commentary, star Raquel Welch says that she seldom had any idea of what Myras motives were from scene to scene or even within any single scene itself, and that each person involved seemed to be making an entirely different film. In the accompanying Back Story documentary, Rex Reed says that MYRA BRECKINRIDGE was a film made by a bunch of people who hid in their dressing rooms while waiting for their lawyers to return their calls.The accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself. The basics of Vidals story are there, but not only has the story been shorn of all broader implications, it seems to have no point in and of itself. Everything runs off in multiple directions, nothing connects, and numerous scenes undercut whatever logic previous scenes might have had. And while director Sarne repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as pure farce, the only laughs generated are accidental.Chief among these accidents is Mae West. It is true that West is unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that she had lost none of her way with a onelinerbut there is no getting around the fact that she is in her seventies, and her conviction that she is the still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely unsettling, to say the least. But worse, really, is the fact that West is outside her era. Her efforts to translate herself into a hip and happening persona results in one of the most embarrassing selfcaricatures ever seen on film.The remaining cast is largely wasted. Raquel Welch, a significantly underestimated actress, plays the title role of Myra very much like a Barbie doll on steroids; nonactor Rex Reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of Myron, but the entire role is essentially without point. Only John Huston and cameo players John Carradine, Jim Backus, William Hopper, and Andy Devine emerge relatively unscathed. Yes, it really is the debacle everyone involved in the film feared it would be fast when it should be slow, slow when it should be fast, relentlessly unfunny from start to finish. It is true that director Sarne does have the occasional inspired ideaas in his use of film clips of everyone from Shirley Temple to Judy Garland to create counterpoint to the actionbut by and large, whenever Sarne was presented with a choice of how to do something he seems to have made the wrong one.The how and why of that is made clear in Sarnes audio commentary. Sarne did not like the novel or, for that matter, the subject matter in general. He did not want to write the screenplay, but he needed the money; he emphatically did not want to direct the film, but he need the money. He makes it very clear that he disliked author Gore Vidal and Rex Reed at one point he flatly states that Reed is not a nice person, and to this day he considers that Vidal and Reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to play into their homosexual agendawhich, when you come right down to it, seems to have been their desire that Sarne actually film Vidals novel rather than his own weirdly imagined takeoff on it.Although he spends a fair amount of commentary time stating that the film is widely liked by the gay community, Sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience arises from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual people. When taken in tandem with the film itself, Sarne emerges as more than a little homophobicand quite frankly the single worst choice of writers and directors that could have been made for this project.In addition to the Sarne and Welch commentaries and the makingof documentary, the DVD release includes several trailers and two versions of the film a theatrical release version and a restored version. The only difference between the two is that the final scene in the restored version has been printed to black and white. The edits made before the film went into general release have not been restored, but the documentary details what they were. The widescreen transfers of both are remarkably good and the sound is quite fine. But to end where I began, this is indeed a film that will most interest film historians, movie buffs, and cult movie fans. I give it three out of five stars for their sake alone, but everyone else should pass it by.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer","label":0},{"index":11316,"txt":"MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is one of those rare films that established its place in film history immediately. Praise for the film was absolutely nonexistent, even from the people involved in making it. This film was loathed from day one. While every now and then one will come across some maverick who will praise the film on philosophical grounds aggressive feminism or the courage to tackle the issue of transgenderism, the film has not developed a cult following like some notorious flops do. It is not hailed as a misunderstood masterpiece like SCARFACE, or trotted out to be ridiculed as a camp classic like SHOWGIRLS. Undoubtedly the reason is that the film, though outrageously awful, is not lovable, or even likable. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is just plain mean. As a Hollywood satire it is coldblooded and meanspirited, but in a hollow pointless way. MYRA takes for granted that Hollywood is a corrupt town, but goes further to attack such beloved icons as Laurel and Hardy, Shirley Temple, Judy Garland and Gary Cooper. The film seems to imply that everything about Hollywood is by its very nature vile. It seems to think that there is something inherently courageous about mocking sacred cows, but does not supply a rationale for doing the mocking in the first place. The film is also viscously antiAmerican and antiestablishment and antithis and antithat, but all in a superficial, late1960s, trendy way. Like CASINO ROYALE; SKIDOO; I LOVE YOU, ALICE B. TOKLAS and other wouldbe hip epics, MYRA is a middleaged vision of the hippydippy youth culture. It tries to embrace the very attitude that it belittles. But instead of being cheerfully selfmocking, MYRA makes no attempt to conceal its contempt for everything that comes within its grasp. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has the humor of a bully; there is not a single moment of innocence in it. Its intentions are not honorable. TIME magazine aptly described it as being about as funny as a child molester, but it is not nearly as sympathetic.For instance, poor Mae West bore the brunt of so much of the criticism aimed at the film, being described as looking like everything from an aging drag queen to a reanimated walking corpse. The octogenarian star obviously did not know just how ridiculous she looked playing a lecherous talent agent lusting after men young enough to be her grandsons or even her greatgrandsons. But, director Michael Sarne had to know, but he used her anyway. Why? Because, she apparently was the joke. Just like John Huston, John Carradine, Grady Sutton, Andy Devine and other veteran performers in the film, they are there only so the film can mock their age and use them to trash their film images. They are cast as smarmy selfparodies, as is Rex Reed, the arrogant, fey film critic, who is cast as just that in the film. But the real Reed, the celebrity hound, jetsetting, talk show gossip, can be charming in an obnoxiously funny way; but as Myron, Myras alter ego, he is just obnoxious. Again, apparently for Sarne, Reed is the joke.You watch MYRA BRECKINRIDGE and you do not see actors, you see victims. None more so than Raquel Welch. No one will ever accuse Welch of being a great actress, but it is a testament to her tenacity and her appeal that she survived this film and her career prospered. Being in almost every scene, Welch was front and center as a target for abuse aimed at the film, but to her credit, she gives a remarkably nuanced performance. Though, of course, centered between the scenery chewing Huston and the almost catatonic West, Welch does not have to do much to strike a good balance. Even so, she renders her horribly unfunny dialogue with a deadpan smirk, with just the hint of selfrighteous glee that would do any James Bond villain proud. Legend has it that Welch was snubbed by a condescending West and subjected to repeated verbal abuse on the set by bumbling director Sarne, not to mention being featured in one degrading scene after another, making it all the more remarkable that she was able to give such a cool and collected performance.The films only intriguing element is trying to figure out just what the films agenda is. The whole story is a fantasy fable, which should indicate that it has a moral to deliver, but what that might be is anybodys guess. With all of its talk about destroying the last vestigial traces of traditional manhood from the race, it would seem to have a feminist axe to grind. But as a feminist, Myra is a monstrous figure, a sexual predator. Besides, Myra is not a woman, rather she is a delusion of Myron, who presumably is a gay male. That might explain the male rape scene as well as the characters lovehate attitude toward the macho, seemingly straight, deadhead Rusty, but it does not explain hisher obsession for and the supposedly lesbian tryst with Farrah Fawcetts Mary Ann. The film is obsessed with sex, but can hardly be accused of being in favor of the sexual revolution; all the sex is treated as being, if not dirty, than at least perverse and degrading. Turning to Gore Vidals original novel is not of any help, because it is as confused and pointless as the movie.And this is a rare movie that actually seems to hate movies. Not just movies as a business, but movies as part of the culture as well. The film itself is walltowall arcane references to old movies, all of which directorscreenwriter Sarne approaches with a seething disdain. He has raided the film vaults of 20th CenturyFox and peppered the film with snippets of old films, not as an homage or to provide a social commentary, but to mock the innocence of old Hollywood. How can an artist  if you generously want to call Sarne that  make a work of art if he already hates the very medium he is working in? The very effort is totally selfdefeating.MYRA BRECKINRIDGE does not seem to be in favor of anything other than being just nasty. It hates Hollywood, it hates America, it hates sex, it hates gays and straights and women and men and old people and young people and Laurel and Hardy and, well, you name it and it probably has a scene showing contempt for it. In a very sad and sorry way, MYRA BRECKINRIDGE may be the first punk manifesto, a celebration of pop culture nihilism.","label":0},{"index":11317,"txt":"Generally I like horror movies, but unfortunately this fell out of the one pound bargain bin into my friends hand. We sat down to watch it, ready to be scared and ended up spraying food everywhere we were laughing so much. The concept is not that bad, but why they decided number ten in the series would be lucky I do not know. The worst thing about the movie is the actors. The camera work was poor, the special effects are actually not bad if I am being generous, but overall the story failed to connect on any levels because the actors were as effective as a small lump of badly charred elm. They were wooden beyond measure, especially a foppish young actor who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent. He looked more like a public school boy in fact. There was a really amusing sex scene where he looked like he was bobbing for apples as a busty lady rode on top of him and later his nappy sized underpants were hysterical, but then I remembered it was not supposed to be a comedy. I am desperately wracking my brain to find something positive to say about this movie apart from the occasional flash of breasts, but there simply is not.

She possesses the Eye of Destiny, good in her hands, dangerous if anyone else got it.Bureau 17 has caught a Satanist from California, Hyde no relation to Dr. Jekyll. Detective Lucy Lutz of LAPD flies to England to bring him back to the US. Lutz is the connection to the earlier Witchcraft movies, having been played by Stephanie Beaton before in Witchcraft 9. In part 7, Lutz was played by another woman; in 6, Lutz was a man!Lutzs part in 9 was not terribly big, but she is one of the main stars in this one. Though she is left behind her high heels and short skirts, she still has revealing tops in this one. And this time around she has nude and sex scenes. Beaton is pretty appealing in the role.As usual, there are a number of sex scenes. An anonymous clubgoer has a fatal threesome with two vampires, the Satanist and head vampire get it on with some kink, Lutz finds an English pal, and Celeste and her boyfriend make love.The main recurring character of the Witchcraft series, Will Spanner, does not appear in this one, although Lutz mentions him to Bureau 17 agent Dixon in a conversation about vampires. She also phones her partner Detective Garner parts 6, 7, and 9, though we do not hear his end of the conversation.Hyde is sprung from jail by a group of vampires led by Raven, for a Walpurgis ritual having something to do with a god named Morsheba I think. Hyde delivers all of his lines in a very flat manner, while Raven overacts to a campy degree. The fight scenes are terribly choreographed.The audio in the movie was pretty poorly recorded, and poorly edited. Additionally, some dialogue gets lost under blaring music or sirens. Cinematography is not great either. Having the movie set in and actually shot in the UK was a bit of a novelty though, at least for this series.Wendy Cooper is very good as Celeste; attractive, certainly, but more importantly she is easily the best actor in the movie bad fight scenes notwithstanding. I am quite surprised her filmography is so small. If there is ever a Witchcraft XIV, and I would bet there will be, they should bring her back, even if it means flying her to California!Witchcraft X is available on its own, or in the DVD collection Hotter Than Hell along with Witchcraft XI and two unrelated movies.","label":0},{"index":11322,"txt":"Ed Wood is eclipsed and becomes Orson Welles.

So basically I paid the rock bottom price of 2.50 for this movie, if you do the math. I cannot exactly say I was ripped off. I have a thing for trashy horror movies, but this is the kind of trash that gives trash a bad name. The budget could not be over 1,000 though it appears as if they spent a total of 1.50. I know it is a lowbudget film, but that is no excuse for totally uninspired camerawork. The film Blood Cult, though not very good, was made for an extremely low budget and still had fairly good camerawork and acting. The acting in this movie is the definition of effortless, especially from that muscular guy with the Texas accent. Everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page. You can take that figuratively or literally. I would not be surprised if the script was offcamera as they were performing. I said before that I have never seen a bad English actor. This movie has quite a few bad ones. And though English movies are not always good, they always seem to have at least a level of sophistication, which is why I do not see why any Englishman, or Englishwoman, would volunteer to do a homevideostyle schlock flick like this. Did Merchant Ivory put a hold on their casting calls? Usually, I think people are too hard on directors and actors. Even some of the worst movies in Hollywood have some level of professionalism in the directing, acting and cinematography departments. Even when you watch a movie like Glitter you cannot honestly say it looks like a thirdgrader shot those scenes though a thirdgrader could have written the script. I have seen home movies that are shot better than Witchcraft X, and that is no exaggeration whatsoever. Even the gore is minimal since the filmmakers only had money to buy some fake blood on sale at Party City. Not a single effort was put into making this movielet us just sum it up like that. You get the picture. There is a good deal of nudity, though that does not save it.

It is based on a story by Thomson Burtis who cowrites the script along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career. A pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third, where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse. The light hearted approach to the romantic strand does not sit quite right, and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by Rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work. But hey, stunt men deserve their moment of glory always. Solid support comes from George Gabby Hayes and Wayne as usual has much screen charisma, particularly when rattling off his pistol.

Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book, and I also hated it.But 1984, I think it was the most disturbing movie I have ever seen, and I think that George Orwell is one of the most deranged people ever to live on this planet.

The acting was nothing above average, and considering the fact that there was not much to act out, this was severely disappointing.

Unfortunately, the movie did not even come close to creating the ambiance or developing the characters that Orwell so masterfully did in his book. The director seems to think that everyone watching the movie has read the book, because he makes no attempt to demonstrate WHY the characters act and feel the way they do. John Hurt, the main actor, is droll the entire way through, and hardly does any acting until the end. We never really find out what he does for a living, or why his love affair is forbidden, or what the political climate is and why the main character desires rebellion. This book cannot be done justice in movie form without proper narration and explanation of the political system oppressing the characters, and the fact that those are missing is the greatest shortcoming of this film. Besides that, John Hurt was a terrible casting choice, looking about 15 years older than the 39 year old Winston he was supposed to be portraying.

I bought the DVD out of sheer curiosity, Burton is an actor I hold in high regard so when I heard that he played the role of OBrien I was swung.I watched the trailer on the DVD first and some fears started to set in, mostly regarding the frankly terrible Theme song, hearing the Eurythmics mechanically shouting 1984! over and over again to an electronic beat is as bad as it sounds.The acting on a whole is pretty good, Burton and Hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth towards the end can be felt, especially in the harrowing Room 101 scene. However this is also where the movie is let down. The movie spends too much time focusing on the Love affair between Winston and Julia, which frankly is not what Orwell was writing about. He was writing about a harrowing future, about how Ingsoc build up a mans beliefs and then shatter them all in the name of him being made to love Big Brother. The movie skips over what is essentially the most important part of the book, Winstons coming to terms with his position in life and the world, and his reeducation via OBrien.The comment on IMDb at the moment states that the movie sticks to the book is completely incorrect. Julia is not present when Winston visits OBrien, they do not commit themselves to Goldstiens Brotherhood and confess their crimes. There is no obvious mention of the initial instances where Winston finds the article with the Unpersons but it does get mentioned near the end, if you have not read the book it is completely confusing.A terrible screenplay, which some excellent acting cannot rescue.

Without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery, and even with it I am still no more educated about the story of 1984 than I was before I watched it.On the plus side...The cinematography is amazing, Hurt  Burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate. The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making.Now for the down sides, and there are plenty...There is a war going on, at least as far as the propaganda is concerned, but why  with who? Nothing is explained. There are a couple of names bandied about Eurasia etc, but they mean nothing without explanation.Who is Winston? what does he do? where does he come from? where does he work? why is he changing news reports? why is not he on the front line? Why does not he eat the food in the canteen? What is that drink he is drinking through the entire film? Why is he so weak  ill? Why is not he brainwashed like the rest of them? What is the deal with his mother  sister? What happened to his father? A little back story would have been nice, no scrub that, essential for those like myself that have not read the book.

I can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you have read the book because if this film really is the literal translation that I have seen many people say, I would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it is.There is no denying that it was light years ahead of it is time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date, maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be?, but many scifi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline.I guess I have to do what I should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i am to make any sense out of this.All in all, very disappointed in something I have waited for years to watch.","label":0},{"index":11335,"txt":"I saw this movie literally directly after finishing the book, and maybe that was a neutral idea or a very stupid one. I think it was the latter. First of all, it was inaccurate in many small, yet important details. One of the first things I noticed was, during Winstons day to day life in his work, his conversations, eating in the cafeteria, etc. he feels free to look unhappy and make suggestive glances at people without immense fear. One of the most important parts of the book, was that even in small activities it was virtually impossible to safely show even a hint of his true emotions on his face AT ANY MOMENT. This is also shown in the scenes on the streets of the proletarions. In the book Winston knew that this was a huge risk to wander around there and was skeptical and frightened at every trip. While in the movie, he does it so often and without fear, that you lose the important feeling of heavy surveillance and risk right off the bat.Other minor inaccuracies included Winston hiding his diary in the wall, yes a very small change, but it begs the question, what is the point? There was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book, and that is morphing characters. The large inaccuracies were far more disturbing, however. First of all, one of the important pieces of the book is that Big Brother is a government based on an intelligent, yet crude philosophy. In the movie, they skip that and go straight to making you think that the government is run by Hitler with technology. Which is true, in a sense, when directed with its facism, but if that is all you get out of Big Brother, you really missed the point of the book. The terrifying thing about Big Brother is that, in a way, it has some points behind its philosophy. When OBrien is picking at Winstons mind in the Ministry of Love, he is LISTENING to everything Winston says against Big Brother. The fact that he listens, and advances forward in his philosophy, is in effect what is most creepy and intriguing. In the end, careful SPOILER ahead when Winston says he loves Big Brother, the terrifying thing is that you are not sure whether it was souly the beating and torture that caused this, or the actual power behind the philosophy. I am in no way saying that the Big Brothers philosophy has points that appeal to me, but its intelligence and depth is what makes this book incredibly disturbing. Also, how could anyone feel any connection between Julia and Winston in the film? It was awful, no connection whatsoever. And where was OBrien before he gave Winston his address? One of the things that carried the book was Winstons thoughts about OBrien BEFORE he made contact with him. In the movie, they just jump the gun. But that about sums up why this movie was a terrible adaption because its impossible NOT to jump the gun and morph characters in less than two hours.

However, I do not think I would have understood the premise of the movie if I had not already read the book. The movie is a noble attempt to show the despair of people trying to break the bonds of overpowering government rule, but the book portrays the suffering much more thoroughly. The corrupt government officials have comfortable, almost luxurious lives, while the common people struggle to obtain the bare necessities for survival. Perhaps most people feel this way toward their leaders and rulers regardless of whether or not they are actually oppressed or repressed. Orwells dystopia seems as if it could exist in many places in our modern world. It has been several years since I have read the book, but one hears references to Big Brother, the Thought Police, and Newspeak frequently in the media and casual conversation.

Much of the film is simply boring, and it only becomes truly terrible with the introduction of the glasseyed superior and the greeneyed crazy marine. After that, though, it just descends into overthetop unintentional hilarity. The ending is fitting though, tying it back into the first one in an indirect way. The script is terrible, the acting mediocre at best, and the direction unimpressive. A much lesser followup.","label":0},{"index":11339,"txt":"Incredible. Does it get any dumber than this? Not a chance. The stupidity in this movie would shame even Ed Wood, De Palma, and Woo. If the first part in the series had mediocre dialog and the second one had bad dialog, then this one has cretinous dialog. Amazing. But this time the story has been lowered to the level of the dialog, too. In spite of the acting and the dialog, I liked the first two films, but Cube Zero will surely kill the franchise. The utterly moronic plot so obviously stems from the pen of a frustrated leftwinger.I sometimes wonder if such leftists even themselves realize just how antidemocracy and prodictatorship they are. In this movie they obviously target the US \u0096 a democracy. Why do not they target Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe etc. in antimilitary movies? Sure, most of these places are hardly likely to produce a cube like this any time soon, but that is beside the point. It is obvious writers of garbage like this actually admire these kinds of regimes, whether they are aware of it or not. I would even go as far as to say that ANYONE who adamantly attacks US foreign policies all the time, has antidemocratic beliefs in his core.Back to the movie apart from being so farfetched that it is not even funny any more, the film has many obvious illogicalities. For example, for some reason the two men who supervise the cube have done it for a while and are oblivious to the pain and sadism that the project entails, yet the first one than the other suddenly turn against the system! Anyone who has any idea at all about human nature will see right through this idiocy. Or how about that cretinous character, the oneeyed evil bureaucrat who talks as if he is in a bad Mel Brooks comedy. In fact, as soon as this creature appears the movie loses ALL seriousness and hence any chance of being exciting it really does become a comedy.","label":0},{"index":11340,"txt":"I was not really fond of the first Cube movie. It was a good idea, but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much. Did not really feel the need to see its sequel but when I heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original. I was intrigued, thinking that maybe they would fix some of the originals problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters. Well I thought wrong.Cube Zero starts well enough by introducing us with the two characters in charge of watching and maintaining the neverending maze of traps that plagues the people in the Cube. The filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two mens daily routine. Several questions are created from it, concerning the reason why people are send there and also the true nature of the ones who run the entire operation. All of which are left entirely to the viewer. The acting was a bit weak but all in all the movies first half moved relatively well.With the story moving on, one of the two watchers begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing. And later decides to go and help a group of the people trapped. Here is where everything rapidly starts to dissolve into dull cheese.Sent by the people who run the Cube program we are introduced to the character Jax. Along with his two underlings play a major reason as to why this movie is failure. To start of Jax looks and talks more like a third rate villain taken directly from a James Bond movie complete with the ever popular glass eye, that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the first halfs relatively nice pace. Whats more is that it begins to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie. With some incredibly corny lines, perhaps the screenwriter got bored and did not care. The acting itself degrades to a further low when the former watcher meets the group in the Cube. The entire interaction is painful to watch as is everything else following it.Again failing to impress on anything but weak characters, dialog and acting Cube Zero is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie.","label":0},{"index":11341,"txt":"Some people might consider this movie a piece of artwork  to be able to express your imagination on film in order to create a movie filled with antagonizing pain and death..

The music is genuinely pretty, and the story deserves to be called classic. What fails in this movie are the characters, particularly the title character, who could only be called the heroine in the loosest sense of the term.After a brief prologue, the audience is introduced to Cinderella. She is waking up in the morning and singing A Dream is A wish Your Heart Makes. This establishes her as an idealist and thus deserving of our sympathy. Unfortunately, the script gives us no clue as to what she is dreaming about. Freedom from her servant role? The respect of her stepfamily? Someone to talk to besides mice and birds? In one song cut from the movie but presented in the special features section of the latest DVD Cinderella relates her wish that there could be many of her so she could do her work more efficiently. You go girlfriend! In short, Cinderella is a very bland character. She passively accepts her stepfamilys abuse, escaping into her unspoken dreams for relief. She only asserts herself once by reminding her stepmother that she is still a member of the family. For this, she is given permission to go the ball if she completes her housework and finds something to wear, a token gesture that is clearly absurd to everyone except, of course, Cinderella. Can anyone see Belle or Jasmine being such a doormat? If Cinderella is dull, her male counterpart is nothing short of lifeless. The Prince in Cinderella gets no dialog and almost no screen time. We are given no indication if he is a good man, if he respects Cinderella or anything. All we know is 1 he is a prince and 2 he dances well. Heck, even the prince from Snow White got to sing a romantic song at least. Not only does this lack of development make the romance less interesting, it makes Cinderella look like either a social climber or an idiot, weakening her already tenuous appeal.Perhaps realizing how dull the main characters were, the animators chose to give excessive screen time to the movies comic relief, Cinderellas friends, the mice. Granted, these characters are amusing. Even so, when the comic relief steals the show from the principals, well, let us just say your story has some problems.Dinsey loves to proclaim all its animated features as masterpieces.

Sure, there is sort of an explanation in there, but it feels pretty lame compared to what was suggested in the first film.Cube Zero looks rather cheap as did its predecessors, and the fact that it shows more than just a couple of empty rooms only emphasizes this feeling. I also fell pretty confident in saying that there is no risk that any of the actors will win any awards in the foreseeable future. They have brought back the traps from Cube 1, though, by that I mean that they are almost the same ones, which is a bit of a shame.I know that many people kind of appreciate this film and its ties with the first one, but I just feel that it is a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that was not that great to begin with. 110","label":0},{"index":11348,"txt":"This is pretty much a lowbudget, made for TV, type of movie intended to capitalize off of the success of the original.

The characters are annoying and clich\u00e9d, there are problems with continuity, and several outright production screwups. The story hardly gets a chance to develop because of superfluous dialogue and suffers from that. They more or less use the same horror gimmicks over and OVER throughout the movie, and because the first one was so good, this simply turns out as a disappointment.If this was a standalone bmovie, I would probably give it about a four.

It takes the bold step of explaining what the cube is  something that was never revealed in the first movie  but, since said explanation is bland, I would rather it was kept a secret. There are some potentially interesting references to the society that exists outside of the cube, but they never develop beyond hints about some kind of politicalreligious totalitarian state. So, what little social commentary there is feels flat and unfocused.What works? Basically nothing. The acting is purely amateur hour, the pacing is slow how much of this movie consists of two nerds watching a screen?, and the gore effects, while revolting, fail to convince.

While the first Cube was a nerdy horror movie, which did not make a whole lot of sense in the end, cube zero has picked up on that and tries to retell exactly the same story, except this time it makes an obnoxious point of trying to spoonfeed explanations for every detail that the first movie did not answer. The comic thing is, the director recycles the exact scenes of the first movie that were somewhat weird, and tries to explain them. But the scenes are just copied over, there is no coherence whatsoever. This script is sooo pointless. I can imagine it being written by some halfwit 15 year old with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project.

It set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented, and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they could not understand.

I rated Cube a 10 out of 10, and it is a movie that was never meant to have any sequels.The second movie, Hypercube was a massive disappointment. Some of the ideas were kind of cool, but in the context of the original movie, both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning. Still, for being fairly entertaining, I rated it a 5 out of 10.The third movie, Cube Zero, while ignoring the second, plays like a vastly inferior commercial Bmovie rehash of the first, sans the symbolism. There is no homage or tribute here; there is only ripping off. The same kind of plot, with some elements idiotically altered like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes  an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a ripoff with absolutely no originality and nothing to say.That we see something from behind the scenes means nothing, because the watchers are just part of the Big Bad Experiment, the architects of which we hear nothing of. And, in this movie, those who get through to the exit like Kazan did at the end of the first movie are just killed  where the bleep is the sense in that?! That is just flippin stupid.

Told that the people they are observing are convicted felons who chose this horrific and deadly ordeal over a lethal injection, these observers have had no problem with their jobs until Wynn, a mathematical genius, discovers that one of the prisoners, a woman named Cassandra Stephanie Moore never agreed to be put inside the Cube. Suddenly it is realized that perhaps their jobs are not what they seem, and that they may be part of something deeply sick and twisted...For people that have seen and enjoyed the original Cube, this prequel will probably not be to your liking. It is not that the story does not have potential; it is simply that the first Cube film never needed to be expanded on. Standing alone, it is a neat little psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and a certainty about its own message. It was also nicely selfcontained. The problem with Cube Zero is that it destroys some of the mystique of the original, attempting to answer questions with more questions but only really resulting in making a mess of what never needed fixing.What this new film has to offer, which is questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil, certainly are good questions to be raised, but probably should have been done so on their own merits, rather than as a continuation of a film that had no such aspirations.Having said this, the other traits of the film, such as acting and direction and writing, are not awful.

To me, Son de Mar is beautiful to SEE, but there is precious little substance, unless mawkish, melodramatic, manipulative love yarns turn you on. This may be one of those famous chick flicks you have heard so much about. We are about halfway through this film before anything really happens Ulises Jordi Molla goes out to sea looking for tuna, and does not come back, leaving his wife Martina Leonor Watling and son to fend for themselves. Then, in a furious six minutes of screen time, they bury Ulises, Martina gets married again, and her son grows into midchildhood. This rapid transposition is jarring, to say the least, and very sloppy after 40 minutes of more or less hanging around, we are suddenly into a fullblown melodrama, all in six minutes. I think this is called wayward narrative pacing.Five years later, Ulises as in the wandering superhero Ulysses; get it?, returns to his Penelope Watling only to find she is married to Sierra Eduard Fernandez, an inexplicably wealthy guy what does he DO to earn all that dough? who inexplicably keeps crocodiles as pets. When Martina, in great anger, questions Ulises about his absence, he tells her that he will take her to the island of Sumatra someday and she will understand EVERYTHING.And heres the thing he Does not take her to the island of Sumatra. The reference just dies somewhere in the script. He Does not really explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and child for five years. He Does not acquit himself as an honourable guy, and the movie Does not fill in the plot holes that are staring at us for at least half of the film. I can only assume that director Bigas Luna wants us to fill in the story lines with the mystical clues fish, reptiles, the sea he offers through breathtaking cinematography and evasive dialogue. It just does not work. The narrative arc on this film ends up looking more like a wobbly clothesline.I am sure Jordi Molla is a good actor, but I just could not buy his Ulises as any kind of hero which is what the original Ulysses was supposed to be. With moist sensuality, he spouts a short stanza of identical poetry from Virgil roughly 2,000 times and each and every time it excites Martina to explosive orgasm. This guy should be rented out to reinvigorate stale marriages. I am sure Virgil would be impressed. He did not get laid that often, as I understand it. This poetic device figures prominently in the film, and I had no choice but to assume it was a gender reversal of Ulysses famous siren song i.e. beautiful maidens singing seductively to faroff sailors, who were doomed if they answered the, well, siren call. If this is what Bigas Luna is up to, you can see the problem  he is offering convoluted symbolism in a snatchandgrab attempt at High Art. Once again, it just does not work, at least in my eyes.Watling is a beautiful and magnetic young actor, but she gives us a character here who does not seem to have much intellectual or even romantic depth. It is beyond me how she could desperately fall in love with a guy who sports a forrent sign on his face as in vacant, oily 1960sstyle hair that looks more like seaweed, and one of those trendy 21stcentury beards you know, four days growth, no more, no less. He is SUPPOSED to be a dreamy kind of guy I think, but those eyes of his suggest he might be suffering more from overexposure to a preposterous script. But, do not despair, this film is great to look at. Just do not try to connect the dots on the red herrings or think too much about what you are hearing in the way of dialogue. You can do a lost of fastforwarding on this film particularly in the first 40 minutes and you really will not miss much.","label":0},{"index":11370,"txt":"Previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on TCM, but it was a severe disappointment.

At least the people who made Ben  Arthur were honorable enough to let it stand on its own shaky legs, instead of unscrupulously promoting it so suckers like me would buy it.Everything about this movie is terrible, the script, the story, the casting, the acting, the direction, the photography, the editing, the music... what else goes into a movie?

Why is not the actress who plays Amy listed in the credits? Brandon Alexander gives a great comedic performance as Clitarissa Pink.The worse thing about the movie is probably the star, James Townsend. He cannot act. He is also very scrawny, not nice to look at at all. His arms are like spaghetti. It is disgusting. They have no muscle tone at all. It is no wonder he has to make his own movie and cast himself in it. No one else would cast him in anything.James Townsend is not believable as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he acts so gay. They should have casted someone else as the lead if they wanted what is best for the movie. Then again, maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to launch a career in softcore porn, definitely not real acting because he would have taken some acting lessons. Plus, anyone who does porn is blacklisted in Hollywood.The most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the casting of a tanskinned Latina as Devons mother. Sonja Fisher does not seem like an actress at all. All in all, this movie is softcore porn and is no better than something you would see on Skinemax. I think even Alex Wilson, probably the best thing about this movie, is embarrassed by it and does not want to be associated with it. There is no photo on his IMDb page and nothing else listed, so Alex Wilson is probably a disposable stage name.

So why does not it work? For starters the film loses direction from the opening frame and wanders rather aimlessly throughout the film, dead set on making a suspense thriller but getting sidetracked into satisfying an audience who wants to see nude encounters. Not that that is a bad thing it can certainly enhance some films that have been Hollywood successes. The film also tries to talk about coming out experiences in young men and women, relationships, disturbed parenting, the club scene with all the wild antics that accompany such events  and murder. It is all a bit much to cram into a 96minute film.Devon James Townsend by all appearances is a successful kid with a kind girlfriend Jenna Sarah Kelly but he has an eye for boys and visits a bar where he meets Brian Alex Wilson who has been down the same path and can offer Devon assistance on every level. They bond, Devon comes out, and the mysteries begin boys are missing in the neighborhood, Devons stepfather psychologist Dr. Kirk Tyler Dan Swett is not at all what he appears to be and despite Devons consoling mother Donna Sonja Fisher Devon is cast into the streets because of his new relationship. It seems Dr Tyler is in a dark business with hunky Detective Cunningham Earl McDougle who apparently is investigating the missing boys... Devon gathers his resources from his understanding girlfriend Jenna and her cronies and together the group unveils the dark doings of Dr. Tyler and his detective sidekick. And through it all Donna radiates warmth and understanding as the perfect mother of a gay boy, etc.Some of the actors are pleasing to the eye and there is very little the eye does not examine frequently! but the degree of acting is at an all time low. The only thing that makes us forgive that and in some cases it is just too poor to forgive is the feeling of commitment on the part of everyone involved. Yes, this is a low budget movie and yes, the director needs time to learn his trade. But in the end there is something to be said for the involved people to try to take a gay film to a different level. Maybe their next one will be more polished.

Unfortunately, I was sober when I saw this movie.So quoted the late Gene Siskel for this lamebrained, supposed yukfest that came out two weeks after the far superior There is Something About Mary in a oneupmanship game during July of 1998. Mary was a grossout fest, but in addition to the many gags, it had a lot of heart, which is why it was the highest grossing comedy of that memorable summer.BASEketball tried to outdo Mary, but it fizzled in more ways that one. You take the creators of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who are fortunately not behind the movie but in front of the camera, the only member of ZAZ David Zucker helming the picture in desperate need of a paycheck, and the other two Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker clearly stayed out or probably warned him against the picture, a small bit by now 90 years young Ernest Borgnine, wasting his precious time in his distinguished career, dying on a hotdog and singing I am Too Sexy as he videotapes his will, Jenny McCarthy, who has little screen time as Borgnines nottooweeping trophy widow young enough to be his granddaughter, a bigger female part by Yasmine Bleeth as a dedicated social worker whose charges are underprivileged youngsters, and the only interesting and meaningful player in this turkey, Robert Vaughn as a corrupt archrival, and pointless cameos by Airplane! alumni Kareem Abdul Jabaar and the late Robert Stack who seemed nostalgic for the 1980 masterpiece and it is much fresher humor created by the ZAZ family. What do all these people make up? A desperate cast and crew trying to replicate Airplane! humor and mixing it up with the crudity of South Park, but failing in every way.To make this long 100minute movie short, BASEketball, a real game invented by David Zucker and his friends in his hometown of Milwaukee, is about two lazy losers Parker and Stone and their pintsized mutual friend who invent baseball and basketball hence the title together on the driveway of ones house. After Borgnine dies, he bequeaths the ownership of his BASEketball team, the Milwaukee Beers to Parker and Stone. Sure enough, the game goes national, and archrivals Vaughn and McCarthy want to take away ownership of the Beers team from them. But Bleeth is in love with both men, particularly Parker, and one poor, sick charge in need of a liver transplant goes gaga over them. Those are the characters, not strongly developed.Now witless gags ensue. Blood, electroshock hair, eggthrowing and screaming are among them. Parker and Stone nearly kill the youngster in the hospital, but he pulls through the liver transplant. Borgnine sings and rubs ointment on his chest in the videotaped will. McCarthy, who seemed to get over Borgnines death by choking on a frank right away, quickly massages Vaughn in the next scene. Cheerleaders dance in skimpy outfits. There is plenty of music on the soundtrack that is played for the hard of hearing. And David Zucker forces the parodies of Riverdance and Titanic. Parody forcing is nothing new to ZAZ, post Airplane! and The Naked Gun series.And like Siskel, I was sober as well, but I was also getting sleepy. This movie should be played over and over to coarsemannered barroom patrons who enjoy it as they chug down beers, but will they remain alert and awake, or pass out during the unfunny parts?

For some reason, scientific laboratories and outposts always have a staff of grubby, dirty, meanspirited, misanthropes living inside. These folks who presumably work together on complicated scientific projects cannot seem to agree on how to survive death at the hands of a CGI Dragon. Spoilers An extranasty scientist whose main acting skill is leering and the sinister stare has cloned a Dragon. While the lab was supposed to work on this kind of thing, the other scientists are shocked, because apparently they were all way behind in their experiments and got caught with their pants down. The rest of the story is like THE THING, or Ten Little Indians, where the staff is hunted and killed off as they try to formulate a way to escape andor defeat the Dragon. The CGI Dragon creature is dark gray, which seems to be the popular color for most of the cheap CGI special effects. It hardly looks better than a cartoon, and the dark gray tones make it difficult to see any interesting details in the body of the Dragon. All it looks like is a gray blob. The acting is less than horrible. These scientists act like a bunch of children who cannot agree on anything, and this makes it easier for the Dragon to kill them off in various attempts to escape, hide, etc. Dean Cain is hardly better than any of the cast of unknown actors in this movie. He seems to sink to the level of his supporting cast. This movie is really, really atrocious. The acting is bad. The story is dumb. The CGI is very very cheap and amateurish.

BASEketball is a waste of film in all most every single way. It is offensive to all the senses. This does not necessarily bother me, I have seen plenty of bad movies, really bad movies before and will see them again. BASEketball though is a caliber film where you regret wasting ninety minutes of life sitting through it. The reason BASEketball offends me is that it stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone in a film they did not write. Any respect I had for David Zucker has long since depleted. His recent spoof films are lazy messes that look and feel as if they were made by prepubescent boys snickering at penis jokes. Airplane was a revolutionary and very funny comedy, watching BASEketball you will be amazed to discover that they were made by the same person.I have so much respect for Trey Parker and Matt Stone. These men are the funniest and smartest comedians in mainstream entertainment today. Their pictures and South Park episodes are as relevant as they are funny. Every joke even the fart jokes have intelligence behind them. It is easy to forget that there is a mature way to approach immaturity. I imagine BASEketball was a major growing experience for them because they hate the film for all the right reasons. It is a stupid mess with no sense of dignity or class. Parker and Stone have essentially whored themselves out. The film plays like a 90 minute episode of Family Guy.Parker and Stone have never been great actors. They have been serviceable in their films. I cannot really find a way to describe their performance in BASEketball, other than the fact that it feels like they are spoofing a spoof film spoofing a spoof film. Every line is delivered in such a silly winking way. It is like they are trying to make fun of the worst of these type of pictures and yet they become them in the same way. I am reminded of the South Park episode How to Eat with your Butt where Cartman sits in a movie theater watching a gross out comedy with no plot or plausibility except to gross out, Parker and Stone use the same voices they did in that scene for this entire picture. Really it is sad.And yet that is not my problem with BASEketball. My biggest gripe with the picture is that I sit there knowing that Parker and Stone are knowingly following this piece of crap script. I know that if they took the damn thing and rewrote it that this could have been salvaged to the point of being watchable. There is not any indication that Zucker let them improv scenes either. Parker and Stone are merely tools to a bad director. BASEketball has some funny concepts and I think Parker especially if he were allowed to take Zuckers script could have elaborated on them more. Instead we get potty humor. Do not rent BASEketball you can get the same laughs watching a group of grade schoolers joking around","label":0},{"index":11400,"txt":"When you wish for the dragon to eat every cast member, you know you are in for a bad ride.I went in with very, very low expectations, having read some of the other comments, and was not let down. Unlike some other cheap and failed movies, however, this one does not really remain hilariously and unintentionally funny throughout.SPOILERS FOLLOWFirst of all, plot it very inconsistent. Looking past the small mistakes, such as the dragon growing up in 3 hours, the whole idea it is based on is messed up. See, the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites which really were dragon eggs. After explaining this, they show some peasant poking at one with his pitchfork and the dragon pops out. Later, the obligatory crazy scientist guy babbles on about how dragons outlived the dinosaurs. So apparently humans were around when dinosaurs were, or we just have a fine little plot hole here. The other major thing is that the lab is blown up with a force half as strong as what was used for Hiroshima. Then two guys later walk in to check everything out, and it is almost unscathed! There is even another dragon, which grew out of who knows what. All in all it is very predictable. As soon as the guy mentioned cloning, I guessed they would clone a dragon. That means that our Mr. Smartypants security guy is not so intuitive and smart as the movie would have you believe, if you ignore that I knew this film would be about, you know, dragons.Putting that aside, the second worst thing is the special effects. Others have mentioned the fake rocks falling during the beginning, the CG helicopter, and the dragon. It looks a bit better than a blob, but it ruined whatever it had going for it when it trudged down the hall in the same manner time after time. To their credit, the flying dragons in the beginning looked OK from far away although the one in the cave is probably the worst one in the whole movie. These things are funny to watch, however. The scenes where a million different shots of the same person facing different ways are shown are not. Nor are the introduction screens with the vital stats.Coming to the actors, they were not the greatest, but I guess at least they tried? They seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors participating in the recent BloodRayne, for example, and you have got to give them points for that. One thing I noticed though was that the woman who plays Meredith often had her face covered in makeup that was many tones lighter than the rest of her. She looked like she had a bad runin with some whiteface.The script is bad and cheesy. You do not really notice the music, but it is actually not too bad for the most part.The bottom line is do not watch it unless you want to see it because you hear it is bad like I did, although the only funny things are the bad CG effects.

My intention is not to burst anyones bubble, because I have seen, as I have skimmed through other comments, that this movie is quite appreciated by many. Well, it is not worth any praises, and I say this because I have seen the original anime, Basilisk, and this movie shames it deeply. Perhaps if you see Shinobi alone, you could like it. It is enjoyable due to the wellchoreographed battles, based on fantasy more than on martial arts, and I agree that their beauty is deeply enhanced. But the story is nothing like the original one. Now, I understand that when one transforms an animemanga into a movie, one must make certain changes. I was not expecting to see the freakish characters from the anime, although they have a wellestablished role, and some are truly profound and welldesigned. But I certainly did not expect to see immense and wronglyplaced changes, that basically ruin the entire story. Characters who are dramatically and unethically mutilated, transformed in something the public might love more, perhaps. For instance, Oboro, who, in the anime is a sweet, innocent girl, completely and utterly in love with Gennosuke, becomes a vengeful clan leader in the movie. I liked the fact that the woman becomes strong and evades the limitations imposed on her by the era we are talking about Japan, 17th century, but her mood changes are unbelievable and badly written. Hotarubi, which is one of my favourite characters in the film, but who is not known for her childish and sensitive nature, becomes a pathetic little girl who is not only not madly in love like in the anime, but is more or less worthless in the plot. I could go on and on, like how they made Tenzen, the worst and most dangerous character in the anime, exceptionally weak and unattractive, or how Gennosuke, the leading character seems completely misplaced and confused, not to mention, again WEAK. The music is beautiful and the image is astounding, which was expected of a Japanese movie, and I appreciate it for that. But do not watch this if you have seen and enjoyed Basilisk, because it is just hopeless. Basilisk, although based on fantasy, with elements of horror and largely exaggerated is splendid and has so much more depth in its characters, storyline, historical value and it is, may I say, heartbreaking. Shinobi was a waste of time and I could not believe it kept on going after what was supposed to be the climax. Alas, it pains me deeply to judge a movie so harshly, but I advise you against it. Please, watch the anime, or at least watch the movie first and then repair your image of what Basilisk really is by watching the anime. Otherwise you will have a seizure when you realize how they have massacred it.","label":0},{"index":11414,"txt":"I have watched anime but I am not a die hard fan; and I do not read manga.

Yes, it is very beautiful  the slow motion water scenes, the autumn leaves on the trees, even the CGI eye flicker  majestic. I liked the hawk, the costumes, even some of the fight scenes, but overall this was dull as dirt.It seemed as if someone took Romeo and Juliet  the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers  and threw in some XMen for good measure. Two of the characters split Wolverines powers  the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the greyhaired guy had his ability to heal himself. Then you have the girl who has a poison kiss  that is Poison Ivy from Batman. Why do they give these women such dumb powers? Poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death. Man, that is some great power for you. And the other girl, can create bugs from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands. The other woman, one of the star crossed lovers, has the power of a hypnotic stare. Wow.I sort of made it to the end of the film, by fast forwarding it, and did see a bit more tragedy than I expected. Some people are comparing this to House of Flying Daggers and Hero.

The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters, all of whom die.OK, so if you cannot be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, you can at least make the REASONS for why they die plausible, right? Nope. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, with neither side really knowing WHY they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. Yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them dead, they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions.

After all, we do not see beautiful young people on stage with old opera singers back stage singing from behind the curtain! Do not discount the success of using heavyweight opera singers.

MGMs intent behind this comedy was to contemporize and Americanize Garbos image for wartime audiences whom the studio heads felt were not interested in the tragic period characters she favored in the thirties.However, Garbo appears illatease mostly as the bogus party girl Katherine and especially compared to expert farceurs like Douglas and Constance Bennett as romantic rival Griselda. Photographed unflatteringly by Joseph Ruttenberg, Garbo looks tired in many scenes and downright hideous in her teased hairdo for the chicachoca dance sequence. The story ends conventionally but with the addition of a lengthy physical sequence where Larry tries to maneuver his skis on a series of mountain cliffs that unfortunately reminds me of Sonny Bonos death. Roland Young and Ruth Gordon in a rare appearance at this point of her career show up in comic supporting roles as Douglas associates. This movie is not yet on DVD, and I would not consider it priority for transfer as it represents a curio in Garbos otherwise legendary career. She was reportedly quite unhappy during the filming. I can see why.","label":0},{"index":11426,"txt":"The story is a little slow and a little stupid. Greta Garbo does not look very good and I could not understand half the things she said because of her accent, which was exaggerated for this role. Melvyn Douglas, meanwhile, plays his normal unlikeable role and Constance Bennett is just soso except for a couple of her screams, which were funny. On the plus side, Roland Young had the best role in the film. I wish he had more lines, as he disappeared in the second half of the story. Also, it was interesting to see Ruth Gordon look so young. I had only seen her in those crazy roles she played from the late 60s to the 80s and a whacked out old woman. Storywise, the best part might have been the final few minutes when we see a stunt man doing amazing things on skis, pretending to be Douglas falling down the slopes. That was amazing and humorous footage.Overall, I can see where this film  Garbos last  was not a boxoffice success. It just drags too much, going on and on about deceptions. It is an annoying story.

The new characters are not that great; they just serve to make you miss the ones that they are replacing. It is the same with the new actors including Jamie Farr.

However, Harry Henry Morgan, and Mike Farrell, both singularly and compositely together is like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Swit, which I also found dull, also to no fault of her own was not a wonder to look at, and Gary Burghoff, who was good in the movie got tired looking and acting as the show wore on.

It was not. It was just boring.

Steinbergs script seemed initially having some real smart points that could have made good romantic comedy, BUT BUT BUT, oh dear ! What did ever happen in the way ???!!!! I will tell you what happened. Originally it is Animal House  1978 and Porkys  1982. Although that was long time ago, but those are the pioneers, the godfathers of the new genre  the crude teen comedy. Then the 1990s came. After important instances that became smash hits repulsive ones am I add such as Problem Child  1990, Dumb and Dumber  1994, The Nutty Professor  1996, and There is Something About Mary  1998 which I think slackers is affected by, there was the top of the era and the prophet of the next era, the one and only  American Pie  1999 whichs undoubtedly and incomparably a genres icon. After that I think every comedy of that kind got to be that highly filthy, cum laude nasty, to be admired by the youth otherwise it might be out of fashion !I believe that Slackers had a smart plot first as a script, then its makers got to add some real big amount of  rudeness, filthiness, strangely shameless sex to be made  at those days  as easy as pie ! Like they had to fill every scene with freely elements such as  masturbation, oral sex, urination.. etc just to look a la mode. They are wholly unnecessary elements to the story but surely THEY ARE so necessary to make the profits, and to catch the latest vogue in making teen comedies. The problem is in how all of that has replaced already any possible comedy in it.Some of its moments looked literally horrible, and that as you see is the point. It is all in Jason Schwartzmans looks and performance; memorably disgusting to the utmost. So the ambition transformed from being that romantic comedy into making what was not done before of pure skinning images. To be more like a horror where you are asking all the time; what nastier would happen ? vomiting, farting,.. etc; these are the easiest combination to create a comedy nowadays.Though even if you hated it you have got to love something mostly for being bold, for me it was only Gina Gershon cameos scene. Anyhow they designed it as a whole to achieve being outragesforoutrageousness, like an adolescents naughty dream. Though the majority of it was near to anybodys nightmare.What made me sad is that this one at its core was a real potential work, and not another cheap, another stupid comedy as it eventually managed to be. Remember well the details of stealing the exam the first 2 minutes, so the movies main plot weirdo trying to reach a girl by blackmailing cool guys through the pattern of boy loves girl, and girl loves another boy because save that, it is nothing but a candidly schlock. It dealt with its material the tacky way bunch of dirty college boys, who got nothing to do but making mawkish quip out of anything, would do. It ended up as being, and I am sorry to say it, a smiling sht !At its end it said something can you imagine ! about how it is the time and the place too for the impostor or the slack to win, totally like this comedy itself. It sounds good ending yet for totally another better movie; which could assure my opinion about this one as smart one.. Once ! And it does not need much to understand that this movies makers were the real slackers ! Maybe being stupid is a way to be smart in Hollywood, but even if.. The final result here was not at least witty by any sense of the word. P.S  Its scriptwriter David H. Steinberg, who wrote the story of American Pie 2 as well, has a main page at the IMDb where you will find under the Additional Details his usual Plot Keywords which are  Sex  Vulgarity  Crude Humor ...

The plot is very stupid and there is no reason why to watch this unless your looking to shut off you brain for a little while. Slackers is just a predictable teen flick that really adds nothing new to the genre. The comedy in Slackers is either hit or miss but there is no real true funny or original moment in the movie. Its really just a collection of gags and some are actually pretty funny. Though for every joke that works there is at least eight more that do not. The screenplay is full of penis and breast jokes that some high school and college students may enjoy. Even if they do they probably will not remember this film after awhile as its not a very memorable comedy. Jason Schwartzman plays the freaky Ethan and after appearing in some good comedies he has stoop pretty low. Jaime King and Devon Sawa are the other main stars but they do a rather poor job in this film. This is directed by Dewey Nicks and this is his first film so you cannot blame him too much. The funniest character was probably Laura Prepon though, she is not in the movie very much. The film is very short at only 86 minutes long however, that may be too long for some people who do not really like this type of humor. Slackers is not the worst film of 2002 but certainly is below average. When compared to other films in the genre there is a lot better out there such as Not Another Teen Movie, American Pie and its sequels , Scary Movie 1  2 etc. So unless you have seen most of them and you are looking for something new then Slackers might fit that bill but its better if you just watch something else.

Release dates were continually shifted around for this truly awful movie that is so much a bleep on the radar like it deserves. The premise kicks off under the guise of Ethan, a creepy nerd with a scary obsession for the campus bombshell Angela. Ethan devilishly enlists the aid of David and his friends who have been scamming the school for their entire run with blackmail to help win Angela. I do not like to give spoilers out, but for a piece of crap like this I can make an exception. Angela falls for David, Ethan intentionally screws everything up, the good guys win. That is what happens in a nutshell for another tired retread of the teen gross out genre. Gross humor is funny, it always has been dating back to the days of the immortal classic Animal House, to the likes of contemporaries like There is Something About Mary and Road Trip amongst dozens of others of which there are too many to mention. But when you use it as a plot point you can only get so far, case in point, Ethan has an Angela doll composed of her individual strands of hair of which he does god knows what with it. No one wants to take witness to watch Ethan urinating in the shower while singing to himself. No one wants to watch a young man singing She will be coming around the mountain with a sock on his penis. But nothing can prepare you for the full visual assault of seeing 50s bombshell Mamie Van Doren bare her breasts at 71 years old.

Director Dewey Nicks was a former fashion photographer, and after reviewing this film, you can only wish he will go back to the profession. The worst thing you can do on any film, is to make it look like you are having fun, because you detract from your objectives, just like Slackers does, by burying it is plot outline under a pile of gross out gags, pointless vignettes, and lack of construction. It is like a bunch of college students got drunk, took ones camcorder, and shot a bunch of random crap and compiled it together. If you want to see a teen gross out comedy that is actually good, then I suggest American Pie and Animal House, or Road Trip, just something that is entertaining, and not dreadfully bad like Slackers. Coincidentally Cameron Diaz makes a cameo in this film, just as she did in another bad film such as The Sweetest Thing where the story treats gross humor like another plot, instead of a device much like this disaster..

The director apparently changed his mind when the XVII century is involved, and films actors, dressed like 1600s peasants reciting their antic text surrounded by contemporary trees and landscapes. But the all thing looks even more ridiculous than Luchini and its fake trees. It is not that the story itself is stupid, but the way Rohmer mixes naturalism with artifices seems so childish and amateurism that it rapidly becomes involuntarily funny and I am not even talking about the irritating pronunciation of the actors, the annoying and sad humorist tries by Rodolphe Pauly, the ridiculous softerotic tone, the poor musical tentatives, or the strange fascination for trasvestisment!.The radical aesthetic of the film ultimately makes it looks like a joke, which mixes a softerotic movie made for TV with theological scholastic discussions sic !.

Working in three epochs presents many opportunities to introduce anachronisms including silly and impractical clothing and peculiar spiritual rites that involve really bad poetry. Lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct from which crossdressing and assorted farcical situations arise.

Those wonderful people who gave you the Nouvelle Vague, Cahiers du Cinema have already named it one of the best films of 2007 so that should give you some idea. Reality is not high on Rohmers agenda so that in 5th Century France we have at one extreme a ch\u00e2teau that would not be out of place in the Loire valley whilst the only other dwelling we see is a rude wooden hut. The story involves nymphs and shepherds and as he often does Rohmer has cast it with unknowns who just happened to be passing so that the overall effect is that the annual class play at a school for Special Needs pupils was captured on film by accident.

It fails to address the reason Israelis are there. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel.

Problem is, 242 was rejected immediately upon it is inception by.....the palestinians, making it void.Many films are put together well, and can really show footage that changes minds, but remember, when watching anything, believe none of what you hear, and only half of what you see.All participants in this film are known critics of Israel, and some have made many antisemitic public comments, removing any possible credibility to their words.All participants are in dire need of a actual history lesson taught objectively, not by some palestinian sympathizer.","label":0},{"index":11487,"txt":"After buying the DVD in a Bargain Bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover, I popped it in the DVD player and everything looked good.

In that cartoon, Speedy has been an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth but by his second appearance the famous design had already been adopted. Despite looking significantly more handsome, Speedy never developed into much of a character. A big hat, tremendous speed and a bad Mexican accent do not a classic character make and that is pretty much all Speedy ever had going for him. Nevertheless, the cocky little mouse proved enormously popular and went on to star in many shorts including some truly abysmal films from the studios latter days. While these early Speedy shorts are better than those later atrocities in which he was frequently rather oddly paired up with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired, relying on predictable gags usually based around a similar chase formula. In this selftitled episode, Speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory which happens to be guarded by Sylvester the cat. Although he brings the extra weight of a star turn to the cartoon, Sylvesters role here could just as easily been filled by any other generic cartoon cat. His personality is sapped by his being forced into the predictable. undemanding role of pursuer. This was always a problem in the Tweety cartoons too but Speedy makes an even duller adversary thanks to his detestable cockiness and the blatant impossibility of his capture. Poor old Sylvester would be forced to appear alongside Speedy for many years to come. Despite it following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laughs, Speedy Gonzalez won an Oscar and a thoroughly undeserving star was born.","label":0},{"index":11491,"txt":"I have seen this movie today for the first time and I never heard of it before, probably because of it is poor message.

I have spoken of taste in another review, saying it is all in the eye of the beholder but when it comes to this film, if you like it, it simply means you have bad taste.I love films. I loved Isle of the Dead which is pretty much an unknown BW film. I even liked Scream and Scary Movie I liked these films because they have, if not a lot, at least something good about them. I appreciate 99.9 of the films I have seen because they tell a story which I have not heard before, and most directors only make films with a good storyline. Throughout this film I was thinking Where is this going? even near the end Where did they get these awful actors from? Was that supposed to be a joke? and suchlike. With the obvious twist looming I was sceptical, but hoped it would perhaps make the film and prove I had not wasted my time. I was sadly mistaken. The storyline was bad to begin with and the twist actually ruined any glimmer of hope there was. Heres a rundown Storyline \u0096 much like the first film, which was alright, this one is slow and sparse with no audience relation to the characters or the situations. The situations are cringeworthy and shallow and completely boring and predictable. The twist was terrible, it did not make me feel a thing, like excitement or WOW. Just My GOD. There was nothing in the bulk of the film that you could look back to and think Oooo was not that clever because it was not. In Fight Club there are flashbacks at the end showing bits where Tylers true identity was cryptically shown, and when you watched it again you saw more, it really was a work of genius, how it was written, laid out and directed. This was a meaningless attempt at an awesome twist. I think it was wild things that had like a pretty poor double twist and I still liked the film because the rest was OK and it was not trying too hard to be a big twist. Its like the CI2 writer thought it was gonna be the best twist ever. But really, its just a bad story with a bad twist dumped on the end. The film ended almost immediately afterward, with the whole film void by Sebastians whole story build up meaning nothing and a horrible half forced, paedophilic ending with a particularly young and innocent acting girl. Acting \u0096 the actors in this film are appalling. Almost as bad a Sunset Beach.  Extremely corny and badly performed. It is not even so bad it is good like Hunk. The worst acting I thought came from Amy Adams who played Kathryn, it was a rigid, pathetic and badly thought out performance by her. Robin Dunne was also poor. I have not seen American Psycho II yet, but no doubt his laid back cool style has ruined that film also.I cannot even say it is a good film for teens, as its not. If my son or daughter liked this film I would be ashamed. But they would not anyway, as they would take into consideration all the things that make a good film, which this film has none of. Really. I am disappointed that some have said you might not be in the age bracket for this film, and so dislike it I like all the films now that I liked as a teen and had very good taste. Also, do you really think that when you reach 20 you suddenly do not like any teenish story lines? No. I liked Mean Girls and other generic teen films, and watch Beverly Hills 90210 all the time. There is no excuse for poor directing, acting and screenplay I am afraid. Besides, I was 1617 when I first watched it. If anything, being older just makes you a better judge of a terrible film. I cannot believe anyone can give it 1010 either, one of my favourite films is Memento and I gave it 9 as I know there can be better. It is a shame for this site that people do that, give 10s flippantly, or do not get the filmsshow, and so give it 2.Anyone who liked this film really should vary their taste, and perhaps their lives, and with this realise that this is the worst film EVER made. worse than Loch NessIf you are not a teenager with bad taste, or simply do not have bad taste you will absolutely hate this film.","label":0},{"index":11494,"txt":"I think this is probably one of the worst movies I have watched in a long time.Trying to get the same characters with different people is such a bad idea.

The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way to many goofs, and the editing was very poor  to many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way to soon and Clarks appearance in the movie just did not seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there  they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all.I think the script writers should have went more by the book. It seems like every movie that is been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Okes writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willies reactions to Kathys death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard.Out of the four movies that have been made so far I would have to say that Loves Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clarks character is in them I hope he is got a bigger part and I hope his part is not so bland.

On to Cruel Intentions 2 which was supposed to actually just be the opener for a series based on the film called manchester prep. Which must not have happened. Actually after seeing this trifle of a film i can understand. Before the thing started i was like at least the writer and director Roger Kumble did this one also. Well 1 minute into this movie i was disappointed.

This would have been alright if the lady was not like 50. And basically the rest of the movie is a wannabe carbon copy of the original.

This actually being a prequel i gave it a chance just to see how they turned out like they did in part 1. But with Sebastian being more or less just a prankster and Kathryn being a herself and turning sebastian into the sexual predator he was in the real story, this movie had no foundation to it. Whoever did the casting on this thing was way off. They could have at least tried to get people who looked like the original cast but no, they just hired a bunch of not even really good looking actors. I am using this term although i dont know why. They for sure didnt do any in this movie.All this movie is a bunch of one liners that dont even match the wit that the original had, well some of them did but that was just because they were from part 1. Another bad point was in part one you could understand the need for them to act out for attention because there was no involvement from teir parents this one had them in it and they were poorly used, as if to show why the kids are like this.

After hearing that, it made sense to me that it was not the same as the movie, just as Buffy the Vampire Slayer is different in TV form. I think that Roger Kumble most likely added the ending that this movie had, AFTER the series was not picked up by Fox. It just seems like something that would happen too fast Sebastian becoming the male version of Katharyn and I just do not know where they would go with the next episode, since it would not be leading to the 1999 Film Which the newer ending is directed right towards.One thing I did not like was that it suggested Sebastian and his father had married into the wealth, which is not typically looked good upon in this area of new york, and sine Katharyns mother was just an adult version of her, it did not seem like something a woman in her position would do, marry a man not of her social class.

Other ideas also do not work such as the secret society where all the popular kids meet to discuss the downfall of other students. The film also had a major problem of sexualised 1516yearsold. I know that teenagers do have sex, sometimes a lot, but when done on film or television, is treated very seriously. One famous sense was when Daneille encourages Cherie who is around 1415 in the film to simulate sex on the back of a horse to the point where she has a orgasm. The idea of turning a girl around 1415 into a slut is just very wrong with me, and should not be made into a subject of comedy. The jokes in the film fall flat, whether if it is a verbal gag like she goes all moist when she sees you to a visual gag where Sebastian pushes Kathryn face first into mud.There is a lot wrong with this film, which I do not have time to go into, but I say it should be avoid. Just watch Cruel Intentions, whilst not a classic, still is a decent film and treats the subject matter well.This film is just a perverts wet dream, having schoolkids having lots of sex with each other.","label":0},{"index":11513,"txt":"Basically, Cruel Intentions 2 is Cruel Intentions 1, again, only poorly done. The story is exactly the same as the first one even some of the lines, with only a few exceptions. The cast is more unknown, and definitely less talented. Instead of being seductive and drawing me into watching it, I ended up feeling dirty because it compares to watching a softcore porn. I am not sure whether to blame some of the idiotic lines on the actors or the writers...and I always feel bad saying that, because I know how hard it is to do both...but it was basically a twohour waste of my life.

It was as if they left out good writing in place of unneeded fwords. And the end makes absolutely no sense and does not explain anything. The writing was just terrible. Another thing that bothered me was that they used at lease 3 of the EXACT SAME lines that were in the original. Such as down boy, or the kissing scene, and a few others I cannot remember.

Still, the girl who played Katherine whose name I purposefully do not include  I am pretending she does not exist remains one of the worst actors I have ever seen, only eclipsed by the guy who played Sebastian.

Then the dialogue is also crap.Sebastian About to have threesome If you cant beat them... Virgin Girl Who says you cannot beat em?Lame.The ending contradicts the entire plot of the original. In the first film, it is clearly stated that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons Sebastian wanted Kathryn so bad, aside from the fact that she is played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, was that she was the only girl he could not have and it killed him. She was a tease who liked playing with him. The fact that she never gave it to him increased his wanting. Then in this P.O.S., it implies that he CAN have her, along with a girl on the side. What? And we do not even see the sex, either. It is implied, making it not only stupid, pointless, and contradictory, but worthless too.And in the first one, Kathryn rejects Sebastian because he fell in love, making him a loser. Even though he won the bet, that crumbled his chances. Then in this excrement, he looses AND falls in love. So she does not screw losers, only complete losers? Another thing it is stated that Sebastian has never been in love, so what do you call the thing with Virgin Girl?Then at the end, virgin girl is all of sudden revealed to be Kathryns evil lesbian lover dun dun dun and, like I said, they go into a lame offscreen threesome. Stupid. There is several other plot contradictions. Did the writer even see the first film?

Where the first had a great cast, this one consist of Blist actors and rejects. The acting is mostly horrendously bad. Half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first, as is nearly every major character, including the ones who were not in the first movie. I realize this was made up by a TV series pilot episode, but that is no excuse. They did not have to turn the bad footage into a movie. Only one thing is marginally good, and that is the erotic sequences. However, as these are nowhere near as good as the ones in the first, even this is not raising it above a rating of 1.

The supporting players also look tired and run down, and Sid Caesers presence is offensive even without his constant references to Chinks! One bright spot this would be one of the last times a major motion picture would portray Asians so insultingly ... or, for that matter, star a nonAsian as one!. The film seems surprisingly cheap, with soupy photography and drab sets  even the whizbang Elvis number at the end looks cutrate.

What I and my brother who went and saw it with me did not know is that the scene used in the TV ad was the very last scene in the film!

Set for no real reason,in the 1930s,Peter Sellers does his best with the material at hand but he is not given any really good reason for his comedic moments. The rest of the actors were just plain dull and my brother and I sat all through this barely laughing at anything. It was only natural that we were expecting a Pink Panther type comedy,Peter Sellers was so great at that. It is a pitiful shame this was his last film before he died.

Well on this occasion the elixir is clumsily dropped by an assistant Kato if you remember the Pink Panther movies and he orders his minions to then go find 6 rare items to make the elixir. This creates a global man hunt in which his henchmen end up robbing museums of diamonds and venturing into London, to meet up with Dr Fus nemisis, a retired Scotland Yard detective Nayland Smith, also played by Sellers who tries to stop him in what is suppose to be a witty comedic adventure.This was apparantly Sellers last full length feature film that he made before he died. The terrible tragedy is that he was in it. Sellers who is such a gifted comedian and has had memorable funny roles in the Panther movies and particualrly in the movie The Party, is anything BUT that in this film.

FU MANCHU would be painful viewing. It is supposedly a lampoon of Sax Rohmers famous Oriental villain but it lacks any focus. The potential for satirical commentary on the antiOriental overtones of Rohmers concept are ignored. Indeed, the movie employs racist insults. There are hardly any actual jokes or gags, just mostly actors behaving idiotically and spouting dreary lines. It is especially distressing to see Sid Caesar forced to spout curses and racial slurs for attempted laughs. Most of the other actors embarrass themselves as well.And then there is Peter Sellers. He plays the dual roles of the sinister Fu Manchu, who is trying to concoct a formula to regain his youth and his stalwart British foe Nayland Smith. Sellers is not one hundred per cent bad; he conveys a quirky warmth as Smith when he discusses his fetishistic attachment to his lawn mower and he is oddly moving as Manchu when he expresses his love for English music hall entertainment. But most of the time, he plays both roles with a weary grimness, thus further sabotaging any comical possibilities. Sellers routines where he revitalizes his fading strength with electric shocks are particularly excruciating; he seems too convincingly agonized to be funny. A few genuinely witty lines, an apt slapstick bit by Burt Kwouk Cato in the PINK PANTHER films as one of Manchus minions, and Helen Mirrens amusing musical numbers cannot salvage this mess.

If the movie was done in a more seriocomic vein like BUBBA HOTEP by way of the 1960s AVENGERS TV show, this could have been something special.

Unfortunately this would prove to be Sellers last film, it was even released after his death, but it is still nice to see how the man had managed to keep his irreplaceable talent right until his untimely demise. And not only do we get one Sellers, but we get to, for Sellers plays not only the title role but also his nemesis, the equally bizarre Nayland Smith, the detective on the hunt for the crazed 168 year old Fu. The story is equally outlandish as we follow Fus outrageous antics to make his agedefying elixir and also Nayland and his group of associates trying to prevent him. Just like any of Sellers greater films, the film comes with a guaranteed impeccable performance from him, as well as many of his familiarfaced costars  David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren to name a few. It is also nice to see Pink Panther stalwart Burt Kwouk Cato enjoying a cameo with Sellers  albeit playing the same role, but still nice. The story is indeed pretty ridiculous, as are many of the characters involved, which classes this as a film strongly under the Goon influence. And, although it never reaches the heights of Goon comedy, there are plenty of amusing jokes that seem to point in the right direction. The film failed commercially on it is initial release due to the entire world mourning after Sellers death the film was released less than 3 weeks afterand there is always that sorrowful thought lurking in the back of your mind when viewing it that this was Sellers last film.

GREAT production design, sets, costumes, music, photography, editing, mostly good cast, some decent acting......and absolutely, positively, one of the WORST SCRIPTS in movie history!!!!! AAAUGH!!!!! The first minute of the film is so deceptive... one might mistake this for a decent movie. And then they start singing Happy birthday to Fu... and it goes downhill. Having Burt Kwouk of whom his master says, Your face is familiar. accidentally pour out Fus elixir vitae to put out a fire, resulting in his being condemned to torture, burial and having one of his ears cut off, was the closest thing to funny they had. It was like someone decided they wanted to do a campy film so ridiculous it would be funny. RIDICULOUS, it is... FUNNY... it As not. At all.It is sad, because it is clear in the first few minutes that someone did a LOT of research into the Fu Manchu series in order to get so much of it right. With a different script either a really FUNNY one, or a dead SERIOUS one, they might have could have SHOULD have had a classic on their hands. A film that could have made one forget the horror of those Jess Franco atrocities... instead of making one want to dig them out as masterpieces, by comparison.There was a period in the late 70s when a whole slew of classic 30s characters were revived in movies that were universally awful. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, The Lone Ranger, Charlie Chan, even Doc Savage. I am not sure, this one may be the worst of the lot. It took great selfcontrol not to fastforward over whole sections of it, especially any scenes containing Sid Caesar FBI chief who was also Al Capones cousin you see what I mean?. It is not just that the ideas in the film are not funny... they often make NO SENSE whatsoever. Like when they audition police officers to impersonate the King and Queen, and we wind up seeing people audition dancehall routines like singing, dancing, and riding a unicycle. How many drugs did the writers of this thing have to take for any of this to make sense to them? As I said, a shame... and a real waste of all that talent, including that of Peter Sellers who played both Fu and Nayland Smith, Burt Kwouk whod been in a Chris Lee Fu film in his time, Helen Mirren the police woman who shockingly falls in love with the villain and damn near steals the last halfhour of the film!.

Part of the reasons why this film was not that good was the poor dialog, cheap laughs, choppy directing, and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete.The acting, on the other hand, was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed up picture. I found Sellers portrayal of diabolical Manchu brilliantly done, with the occasional lines that will be remembered. For example, there is the scene where Fu Manchu is confused which henchman is which in which he says Ah, you all look the same to me. I hate to admit it, but I laughed out loud with that line.Then of course a fistful of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with the likes of Helen Mirren as the backstabbing constable, David Tomilson as Sir Roger Avery his last film as well, not a way to end a career, and Sid Ceasar who gives a rather whimsical performance of Al Capones relative who works for the FBI.

I just want to say, Thank you, Mr. Mraovich. Thank you for bringing this creation into the world. We can never repay you enough.","label":0},{"index":11541,"txt":"Worst film ever, this is a statement that people here on IMDb often throw around. Whether it is an Uwe Boll movie, bad classics like Manos The Hands Of Fate or the latest no brains summer action fest from Michael Bay, people are often quick to jump to the sudden conclusion that on the board they are posting that there is nothing worse in the movie world.I envy these people, because they are blissfully ignorant and unaware of how deep the rabbit hole of crap movie making really goes. There are films out there so bad, so hideous, so unintentionally hilarious and so ridiculous that cults form around them to celebrate their awfulness and their discussion boards are the kindest places on the internet due to everyone agreeing unanimously that said film is really that bad.Ladies and Gentlemen, i present to you Ben and Arthur, an 85 minute gay epic that is so utterly bad that it is a lot like a violent car crash, you know it is awful but you cannot stop looking at it. The brainchild of self proclaimed hollywood actor, director and may i add beached whale Sam Mraovich, this film is legendarily terrible. Let me give you a hint of how ego driven this project was. Mr Mraovich not only directed this film, he wrote it, produced it, executive produced it, scored it, edited it and then finally starred in it. This is a man so blinded by his own ego and so believing of his non existent genius that like someone with an ugly child he fails to recognise just how catastrophic his bastard creation really is.Everything in this film fails on an epic level, the acting is the worst you will ever witness, the plot is the most ridiculous, the editing and cinematography is the most amateur and even the music is like nails on a chalkboard. I am aware i have gone on a bit of a tangent here, but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it, i would say this film is horse crap squished into a film reel, but the truth is it was not even shot on film, it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust. Do not get me wrong, i forgive low budgets for films provided the concept is interesting, for example as much as i disliked it The Blair Witch Project proved that low budgets can still lead to an atmospheric interesting film. Ben and Arthur does not have a good concept to fall back on, even if this film was shot on a budget of 20 million with Hollywoods finest actors it would still suck, the plot is that atrocious, and the characters are even worse. One of the main characters Arthur who is portrayed by non other than Sam Mraovich is one of the most whiny loathsome little turds ever put in a film. You will dislike him within 5 minutes of the start of the film and by the end of the film that hate will have turned into outright loathing. Apparently Mr Mraovich forgot that we are supposed to root for the hero.I do not want to spoil all the gut busting hilarity you will experience watching this film which i urge you not to pay for so i will give you two tame mild examples of how stupid this film is, tame and mild as in amongst the least offending mistakes in the movie. In one cut we hear one of the main characters say how they know a good lawyer and will give HIM a call the shot fades out then fades back in and this HIM they spoke of earlier is actually a woman, quite a spectacular mistake to make in post production i think. The second is simple, seconds after seeing this transsexual lawyer the characters are told to fly to Vermont, we then cut to a shot of a plane landing amongst palm trees in a sunny area. I have never been to Vermont personally but i am certain you will not find any palm trees there.Imagine this kind of stupid amateur inconsistency stretched to nearly an hour and a half combined with ridiculous dialogue and plot and then multiply it by 10 and it still will not fully prepare you for Ben and Arthur. Imagine the absolute worst film you have seen in your life and imagine it being even worse and you still will not be on the same level as Ben and Arthur, this film is really that bad.However we should be glad in a way, films like this are a true rarity. They give us hope that one day we can become film makers ourselves or that we can be screenwriters. Simply because we will have a new found sense of confidence due to the fact that we will know that nothing we produce no matter how amateur could be as much of a suck fest as this.The real worst movie of all time has finally been discovered, and it is called Ben and Arthur.","label":0},{"index":11542,"txt":"I do not know what it is about this movie director Sam Mraovich somehow messed up just about every little aspect in this movie. I would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist, but this movie may be the most important of all time. This movie should exist for the sole purpose of being without a doubt The Worst Movie Ever Made. I have seen bad movies in my lifetime, but this somehow breaks what I considered bad into something much more hard to imagine.Everything in this movie is hilarious, but the single funniest thing is that Mraovich himself considers this to be a great movie.Oh wow...","label":0},{"index":11543,"txt":"OK now, lets see. What was funny in the first movie? I know, people with funny accents, people falling into the water, silly boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams. In this movie they have twisted the accent part to the max, no good. A whole a lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons, no good. Boatcrash, check. Funny comments between the two teams, they tried but failed. Also, there are too may personalities they are following in this movie. This film should be about what is happening on the water, not on land. I am sorry to say that there is too far between the funny parts and the sponsors of the film are exploited to the max. No good. All in all, I give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts.","label":0},{"index":11544,"txt":"PhewI do not what to say. This is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers. Some of the acting reminded me of John Waters early offerings. Perhaps I should take that backI do not want to insult Waters ability as a directorstoryteller.I particularly loved the lawyer taking about the full faith and credibility clause. It is full faith and credit, by the way!This also reminds me of The Conrad Boys, where the main actor is also the writer, director, film editor, etc. Those sort of multiinvolved undertakings such as that are probably best left to very seasoned film professionals who would have the technical ability albeit a stunt, some might say to pull something off like that.","label":0},{"index":11545,"txt":"Oh man, what was Sam Mraovich thinking? What was anyone who was involved in this film thinking? Mraovich is the head of nearly everything of Ben and Arthur Director, writer, producer also EXECUTIVE producer!, caster, lead star you name it, he did it. And he Mraovich sucks more than anyone has ever sucked in every department of film making.So what is wrong with this film? Everything. The film is about two gay lovers, Ben Jamie Brett Gabel and Arthur Mraovich groan. Ben and Arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people. To make things worse, Bens crazy exwife they do not exactly divorce, Tammy Julie Belknap is steaming mad that Bens left her for another man and demands Ben that they get back together saying that she can be gay, too! and Arthurs Christian devoted, excessively hypocritical, equally batty as Tammy brother, Victor, is hell bent on making Arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after he gets kicked out of his church.The film is absolutely chock a block with so many goofs ie. Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to get married they go there on Alaska Airlines and Vermont has palm trees; they fly back on a FedEx cargo plane hope they were comfy in a wooden crate, plus many, many more and plot holes to boot Victor calls killing Arthur The Final Plan which later changes to The Final Deed; Arthur and the private intern detective drive the same car, blah, blah, blah. The actors are all very bad and are way, way over the top; the script is laughably horribleone such example is I do not make sense? You do not make sense! I make sense, that is who makes sense! and there so much more wrong with the movie that I cannot write them all down.However, the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about Ben and Arthur is that Sam Mraovich thinks that he has created something that is truly fantastic see his fake reviews for Ben  Arthur and obvious comments by him on YouTube.. Mraovich is narcissistic and his arrogance blinds him from seeing how awful anything with his name on it really is.So, to conclude, forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie ever Ben and Arthur will knock them right off that title, even Paris Hilton movies look like The Dark Knight compared to the monstrosity known as Ben and Arthur.","label":0},{"index":11546,"txt":"Just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself. Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments on here you will be nowhere near able to comprehend how awful this film actually is, although it has to be one of the most hilarious things I have ever seen! Never bothered to post a comment on here before, but this piece of crap really warrants it. Firstly the entire plot is ridiculous and nonsensical. Brother of the lead character either Ben or Arthur, I forget which is which, and frankly it is never very clear wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight  because homosexuality is abhorrent to Christians, but apparently mass murder is not. Then there is some other crap thrown in about one of the gay couples exwife trying to force him to remarry her at gunpoint. This leads to nothing, but provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole film  I do not make sense? You do not make sense! That is who makes sense!. Brilliant.Then there is the acting, which is just atrocious. It must be seen to be believed. My personal favourite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer woman, who is clearly reading her lines off of something, yet still managing to mess them up. Enough said. The gay couple could not be less convincing. There is the vaguely attractive and completely gormless guy, and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon dough man of the bisto adverts. Only fatter. And less talented. The film has also been filmed by someone who is incapable of holding a camera even remotely still, and the number of mistakes throughout is amazing. The whole thing kicks off with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots on. Yep.But anyways, we all know how terrible this thing is, so I would like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the film provides.  When the fat guy sets the church on fire and then prances like a six year old girl across the car park to make his escape. Hilarious. Mildread! No idea what relation she is to the main characters  sometimes they know her, sometimes they do not, but she pops up in a couple of scenes nonetheless. Hilarious. The stoned lawyer. Already mentioned her, but she is so funny she is worth another mention. The evil brothers dinner of crackers that he lays on for his guests. The evil brothers antigay potion. The evil brothers cats. The ending, which I will not give away because it MUST be seen to be believed. I warn you though, make sure you are not eating at the time!!!! The tub of lard main characterdirectorproducer gets naked. It is foul. Basically, Ben and Arthur is indescribably bad, but unintentionally the most comical thing you will see for a long time. Literally, nothing is good about this excuse for a film, the goon of a director even manages to make the opening credits into a joke by writing his own name about 15 times.","label":0},{"index":11547,"txt":"as an actor I really like independent films but this one is amateur at best.The boys go to Vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree  were the directors aware that palm trees are not in Vermont? Pines yes  palms no. And the same for the wedding service  again nice grove of palm trees.When the boys are leaving VT they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is Federal Express. Did they ship themselves Overnight in a crate? Come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur.The Christian brother is far gayer than Arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo. The two should have switched roles.The minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible.Applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time","label":0},{"index":11548,"txt":"This movie is just truly awful, the eyecandy that plays Ben just can make up for everything else that is wrong with this movie.The writerdirectorproducerlead actor etc probably had a good idea to create a movie dealing with the important issues of gay marriage, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crimes and just about every other issue effecting a gay man of these times, but trying to ram every issue into such a poorly conceived film does little justice to any of these causes.The script is poor, the casting very ordinary, but the dialogue and acting is just woeful. The homohating brother is played by the most camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two lead actors I think I have seen more passion in an corn flakes ad. The acting is stiff, and the dialogue forced a scene where the brother is feeding the detective his lines was the highlight.I am just pleased to see that the creator of this train wreck has not pushed any other rubbish out in to distribution, and if he is thinking of doing so, I have some advise  JUST Do not DO IT.","label":0},{"index":11549,"txt":"Let me first state that I enjoy watching bad movies. It is funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones. This film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way. This vehicle for Sam Mraovichs delusional ego does not just border on talentless ineptitude, it has redefined the very meaning of the words. This should forever be the barometer for bad movies. Sort of the Mendoza line for film. Mr. Mraovich writes, directs, and stars as blunt object Arthur Sailes battling scorned wives and the Christian forces of evil as he and his partner Ben dead behind the eyes Sheets struggle for marital equality. As a libertarian I believe gays should have a right to get married. Ben  Arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes. The portrayal of all things Christian are so ugly and hamfisted, trademark Mraovich, that you cannot possibly take any of them seriously. Arthurs brother Victor, the bible toting Jesus freak, is so horribly overthetop evileffeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role. That is because Sam multitasking Mraovich was also casting director. The worst of it all is Sam Mraovich himself. When you think leading man do the words pasty, balding, and chubby come to mind? Sam also delivers lines like dominos pizza, cold and usually wrong. The final tally you suck at writing, directing, acting and casting. That is the Ed Wood quadruple crown. Congratulations you horrible little man.","label":0},{"index":11550,"txt":"Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again. If he does he should be arrested on the spot...at the very least for petty larceny. Anybody who pays even a dime to rent any of his garbage should file a claim and be compensated. This was innocently my first viewing of his work...and it will my last. Ed Wood looks awfully good to me right now.When I return this piece of crap to the video store, I will personally ask that it be taken off the shelf. An active supporter of gay cinema, I am incensed and angered that this warped, exceedingly untalented manchild be allowed to distribute and package something like this, with a coltish pretty boy on the cover Jamie Brett Gabel, who, thankfully, has no other acting credits in IMDb and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait, and then market it as a movie rental. Trust me, this has no place being on any rack anywhere; it is simply not a movie in any sense of the word. Offensive, irresponsible junk such as this can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema hell, gay rights in general! For those tempting to rent this out because of the cover, you WILL be disappointed. Gabel is not as flattering to look at on film as he is on the cover, and he appears once or twice without a shirt  that is it. Instead, the homely Mroavich inflicts on us his own disgusting, sorrylooking doughboy nakedness.This thing he assembled is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch who, I understand, puts out similar sleazy garbage are terrible in this. Mraovich is purposely posing as a complete notalent in all fields, desperate to grab onto any loser attention he can for himself. He is to be pitied.","label":0},{"index":11551,"txt":"I have no idea what on earth, or beyond, could have possibly made Sam Mraovich believe that this would have been a worthy project to undertake. Ben  Arthur is one of the worst movies ever made. In fact, I see no reason why it should not be at 1 on the Bottom 100. For although I have not seen, for example, SuperBabies Baby Geniuses 2 5 at the time of this publication, I would venture to guess that that film is considerably better than this oozing wound, because even in its vapid dismalness at least Baby Geniuses 2 was professionally made. By contrast, everything, and I do mean everything, in this film is completely unprofessional.The movie is intended to be an attack on the Christian Rights supposed bigotry and hatred toward gays. And I do emphasize intended. Not only does it completely and utterly fail at its purpose, it also leaves an ugly scar. Instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrait of a gay couples struggle against a society that largely opposes them, it creates tired, crass stereotypes of each party involved. Ben and Arthur, the namesake couple, are portrayed as two crude, sexstarved, and hopelessly romantic cardboard cutouts who marry when the laws change to allow them to do so. This meets with the opposition of Bens brother Victor, a Christian minister who, like all Christians as this movie would have us believe, is loud, prying, stupid, and violent. He tries to kill Ben and Arthur after his associations with them get him kicked out of the ministry. Just like in real life. And if you think that is dreadful it is, you have not seen it all.The actors ? here manage to completely destroy any vestige of credibility in this movie by saying their lines as if they were narrating a YouTube home comedy video. But not even Daniel DayLewis and Marlon Brando as the title characters could have saved this clunker, for there would still be the matter of the completely inane and laughinducing dialogue that fills every minute of the movie. Every scene has at least one awkward or misplaced quote. For example, in one scene, Victor tries to complain about not being able to have nieces or nephews because of his brothers homosexuality. But instead of portraying this idea clearly, he spits out the stupid, utterly confusing, whinysounding line, You know what, I am never going to have any nieces or nephews, okay, because you are so FED UP!Even more glaring is the complete lack of production values. Yes, I know this as not The Dark Knight, but even amateur film makers should know some basics about special effects and editing. For example, six dots of red cake dye do not suffice for realistic bullet wounds. People do not teleport across a room between takes. And objects do not fall FORWARD when shot! Do not waste your money on Ben  Arthur. I do not care if you are 7, 17, or 107. I do not care if you are gay, straight, bi, or undecided. I do not care if you are just curious. I do not care what pathetic reason you may have to be tempted to buy this dungheap. Stay away, far away.

No tripod and no proper microphone either, there sound quality is terrible. Even Manos fares better than this, at least they had proper equipment.

God I am still trying to recover. This movie does not even deserve a 1.4 average. IMDb needs to have 0 vote ratings possible for movies that really deserve it like this one. A 1.4 is TOO HIGH.I had heard how awful this movie was, but I really did not think a movie could actually be that bad, especially in this day and era. I figured all of the cheesy god awful movies were only from the 1950s and 1960s. My god was I wrong. Trust me folks, this movie REALLY IS THAT BAD. It is beyond horrible; it is beyond pathetic; it is beyond any type of word that I can think of for it. BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like Best Picture of the Year compared to this movie. SNAKE ISLAND which up until now was the worst movie I would ever seen looks like it deserves a few Oscars compared to this pathetic effort.I seriously can not believe that the makers of this movie thought this was a legitimate serious effort of producing a Hollywood movie. This has no business being called a movie. In the first 25 seconds of the film, I seriously thought I was watching some high school theater class attempting to make a short movie. Or better yet, I thought it was some Saturday night Live ripoff skit of the real thing. I mean, it looks exactly like that. The acting is horrible; the whole movie almost looks like it was shot with a 20 year old VHS video camera. the special effects.......well good lord Bewitched from back in the day had better special effects than this movie. The scene where he gets shot at the door is beyond laughable and beyond cheesy. I mean seriously, my Intro to Acting class from 4 years ago in college, all of us could have put together a better movie than this. And the worst part of the entire movie, where Arthur is naked in the bathroom. Oh my god I almost thew up right there. I have a strong stomach, but wow that was horrible. Some people should never be naked, and he is one of them. The plot of this movie just seems to go absolutely nowhere. They talk about legal issues that we never hear about again; Ben talks about getting into music that we never hear about again; arthur says he is looking for a job and money for college and the next thing we see is he is running a porn shop. Everything about the movie is just horrible.This really does not have much to do with my critique, but just so everyone knows, I am not a gay man. I DO however support gay rights and believe we should all be treated as equals. And I would support any gay person in my church, unlike the cruel priest in this movie, who by the way seems to cuss every other word. WHERE IS THE Fing white out? hahaha But I did not want anyone to think I hated this movie just because of it being about two gay guys. It has nothing to do with that This would have been just as horrible of a movie if it was Ben  Jill instead of Ben  Arthur.I just watched this movie to see if it really was as bad as they say. And yes it was even WORSE than I had read. Let this be a warning to everyone ONLY watch this movie if you want to just sit back and laugh at how pathetic some movies in the 21st century can still be. If you watch this movie and are actually expecting a good movie or some entertainment, I have no sympathy for you whatsoever.On a final thought How in the world are there 7 movies ranked BELOW this on IMDb? There is no way there are 7 movies out there that are worse than this!","label":0},{"index":11556,"txt":"Holy crap this movie was bad. I watched it just as a joke. It is not even so bad that it is good in an unintentional way. This film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry. It worked really well at doing that. It is as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie PRIEST, added in a bunch of ugly dudes, took out anything interesting, funny, or even remotely sexy and clever out of the concoction, and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese. That is all this is. Cheese. There is not a single person this film could possibly connect to. There is not any universe this film could possibly take place in. Why cannot a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy? Why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is? Why could not they at least even tried to make it an okay film, or even a Bmovie. Now that I think of it, what they hell were they trying to do with this film? I watched it expecting a campy love story and instead I got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying Christian brother tried to destroy it all!!! No, I am not joking. That is what it is about. Does that sound good? This film is pretty ignorant against people of the Christan religion, with it is stereotyping of all Christians being loudmouthed, rude, and hellbent on making as many people as miserable as possible. A lot of Christian people I know would never speak or act like these freaks. The film, however, is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well. These have got to be the most tastelessly crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that ROADKILL video game. It is so nerve wracking and simply irritating to the point that I was not able to fully pay attention to this film. The makers of this trainwreck had no strategy for set design, acting, camera angles, lighting, script, authenticity, or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting. There is not even a single sex scene, or at least not a believable one. Jamie Brett Gabel was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all, but his good looks were sadly put to waste. This is trash. In a perfect world, this film would get voted a 0.0. It is worth 0 as a film alone. A mentally handicapped nun who is blind, deaf, and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her armpit could write, direct, and produce a better film, and she would probably be a better actor as well. the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word film itself. This film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format. I could put a broom in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini xmas tree and then record that and I have already made a film that will always be better than BEN  ARTHUR by at least half. There are only two things worse than death. Torture and watching BEN  ARTHUR. I am a homosexual and I will probably be the gayest person you will ever meet if you ever met me, and I do not think I have ever been more offended by an entire film than I was by the first five seconds of this film alone. If this movie was a mistake, I will personally find a way to change the famous phrase It is okay to make mistakes to It is okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was BEN  ARTHUR. You know how people always say things like, Good things come out of everything!? I think that BEN  ARTHUR was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of. To call this movie the worst movie I have ever seen would be giving it WAY too much credit. It is as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it is very own. There are good movies, there are bad movies, and then there is BEN  ARTHUR. This is BEN AND ARTHUR.","label":0},{"index":11557,"txt":"Intrigued by the synopsis every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover; this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign I purchased BEN AND ARTHUR without knowing a thing about it. This is my second and I assure you it will be my last purchase of a CULTURE Q CONNECTION video. As far as I am concerned, this DVD is nothing but a blatant ripoff. I do not make this observation lightly \u0096 I am a major collector of videos, gay and mainstream, and I can state with some authority and without hesitation that BEN AND ARTHUR is quite simply the worst film I have ever sat through in my life. Period. My collection boasts over 1,600 films 93 on them on DVD and of those, well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed. I hardly own every gay movie ever made, but I am comfortable in stating that I pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released, and very often I buy videos without knowing anything about the film. Sometimes, this makes for a pleasant surprise  Aimee  Jaguar, It is In The Water, Urbania and Normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that I stumbled upon accidentally. So when I read on the box that BEN AND ARTHUR concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the Christian Right, one of my favorite subjects, I decided to take the plunge sight unseen, despite my previously disappointing purchase of another CULTURE Q CONNECTION title, VISIONS OF SUGAR PLUMS. That film was pretty bad, but compared to BEN AND ARTHUR, it viewed like GONE WITH THE WIND. So what was so wrong with BEN AND ARTHUR? Plenty! To begin with, the plot such as it was, was totally ridiculous. This film almost made me sympathetic to the Christian Right \u0096 we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay, but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls like this even makes sense. The writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all, and several plot points reflect no logic, followup or connection to the story. Murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist  right wing conflict on both sides, and the acting is so bad that it is difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired. The characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay  and nelly stereotypes to boot; the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting. This film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever, and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves. The only advantage this picture has over my other CULTURE Q Connection purchase, VISIONS OF SUGARPLAMS, is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue. Hardly a distinction, since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is. It is an embarrassment to Queer culture, and I intend to warn everyone I possibly can before they waste their money on it. At 9.95 this film would have been way overpriced; I understand that it is soon to be repriced under 20, which is STILL highway robbery. I paid the original price of 29.95, and I never felt more cheated in my life. The only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews \u0096 I have seen user reviews for this film on numerous websites, and there is always one or two that praise the director  writer  actor in such a way that it is obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this Ed Wood wannabe. How sad. How desperate. I just wish IMDb would allow you to assign zero stars  or even minus zero.

This is a serious attempt that flops gloriously. Other reviewers have pointed out the films many flaws, so I will try not to repeat these, but I do urge you to see this film.

The exwifes wrestling match with Ben to get possession of her gun  The detailed sequence wherein Arthur kills the preacher; he apparently burns him up with this incredibly measly match  Yes, the gay religiousfanatic brother with his bleached hair and WeHo fashions  And, my favorite, the use of Joplins The Entertainer as the opening soundtrack and Pachebels Canon in D Major as the closing soundtrack!  the list goes on and on  a MUST SEE!!!","label":0},{"index":11559,"txt":"THE.

Their ceremony  in Vermont  takes place in a garden of tropical plants, including palms, which would not last five minutes in the New England climate. On yet another airplane trip, the establishing shot depicts a FedEx cargo plane taking off. Presumably they could only afford to travel in steerage. As for the plot, this movie expects you to believe that Victor, the devoutly Christian brother of Arthur, is kicked out of his church when the congregation learns that his BROTHER is gay. Not only that, but the pastor eventually sets Victor up with a hit man to have Ben and Arthur killed to purge their souls of sin.

Even by 1950s standards, the special effects are atrocious, except for a couple of underwater submarine sequences. I can only assume that it was nominated for best special effects because, except for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and THEM!, there was not anybody else doing effects. It was certainly no contest for Disney that year if this was their only competition. I would not recommend the film, even for hard core submarine movie buffs, as the most realistic scene on the submarine was limited to one shot where seawater can be seen dribbling down the upraised periscope.

This comment is mainly for anyone who throws all local movies into one basket after watching this film and says all local movies are bad. Please do not judge the rest based on this one film.

Hence I really wanted to like this film. So I am writing my thoughts to save the rest of you from the disappointment I felt watching it. The Leap Years tells the destinyfilled tale of LiAnn who falls for the suave Jeremy and they commit to meet every leap year. A very romantic premise, based on a great short story and with a cast that does not feel like you are watching yet another Jack Neo flick. Then why oh why is it so bad? Firstly, I feel the filmmakers thought they were shooting a music video, because they chose to replace storytelling and any true emotions with cheesy montages, predictable actions and clich\u00e9d lines. I am both upset and embarrassed to have been one of the first few in Singapore to watch The Leap Years, but those of us in the cinema would agree that our muffled groans at the cringeworthy performances spoke volumes. My hope was to watch a romantic movie that would surpass Forever Fever, the best Singaporean romantic comedy so far, and The Leap Years does not even come close. Some blogs have called it The Crap Years which is harsh but ultimately true. Do not waste your money or your emotions like I did. The movie will make you give up on love forever.","label":0},{"index":11571,"txt":"There are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the movies trailer. I am trying to be balanced in my review because I strongly support local movies, but I cannot help but support the backlash against this movie. It is slow, boring and bordering on pointless. Even the almost nice and believable moments were immediately undercut by painful clich\u00e9s and bad acting. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, whom I usually love, were only passable in this movie. It felt like the director was trying to make a melodramatic TV Soap, then got carried away and decided to put it on the big screen. The Leap Years should come with an RA rating Rated Awful but it has not changed my faith in local movies. More good films will come, so long as more films like these do not get made.","label":0},{"index":11572,"txt":"Recherche is a good word to describe this movie.Let us say every movie has a selling point, a gimmick. Transformers gimmick is the awesome effects as well as fan boys nostalgia. Sleepless in Seattles gimmick is situational in their tagline, What if someone you never met, someone you never saw, someone you never knew was the only someone for you? Many romance relies heavily on these gimmicks and some through draw of big names. Leap Years employs both by using the Irish folklore as the circumstance and featuring considerably famous names within the country.So now that the audience are in the cinema, besides all the usual elements in characters, conflict or consequences, crisis, resolve and denouement, they also look forward to stimulating dialog, more absorbing situations as a result of the leap years, interesting subplots and perhaps, to a certain extent, a good twist in the middle or towards the end of the story that favors the circumstances of the characters.This is what Jean Yeo is trying not to achieve. If they have tried to, their goal was apparently in the other court, at the other stadium, on the other end of the planet. She and her writer, Alain Layrac, utterly failed to provide stimulating dialog. Most of the lines were contrived. It seems that they have a bag filled with lines which she would like to use in her movie Okay, these are the lines and quotes which I have heard or read from either movies I have seen or books I have read before and they all sound good to me. If they sound good to me, they will sound good to the audience. Therefore, all i have to do is piece them all together. I am going to use all of them. The result is cathartic. I cannot say that the lines were unnecessary and bears no relation to the story or in driving the plot on, but they seem to spring out of nowhere, catching you off guard with these quotable quotes.On a personal level, i know people who cite quotes based on most of the situations in our dialog, trying to make it meaningful to themselves while nodding along. I do not go out with them anymore because the urge to punch them is overwhelming.Secondly, the characters portrayed are silly and onedimensional. With exception to the unnatural dialog which implies their motivation necessary to drive the plot, there was no sense of conviction in them. I have not an idea who they are. They are all simpletons spouting lines from the advice column of a femaleoriented magazine.The gimmick in the leap years is not enough to drive the story on because the circumstances are too shallow. Then again, there are movies with less but fared better than this, are not there. They made it up with my first and second point. Moreover, the subplots are inconsequential not that it is a bad thing for movies and thin bad thing.Jean Yeo and the producers are trying to pass off the terrible plot with fancy locations and passable photography. This is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to attain the approval from some viewers than the others with the good use of cinematography, soundtrack and filming location. These nondiscerning viewers.It is not even the kind of movie that is so bad that it is good. It is just bad. Do not watch this.","label":0},{"index":11573,"txt":"The Leap Years is a movie adapted from an enovella by Singapore writer Catherine Lim, which became the first Singapore novelnovella to be sold over the internet. The film had a tortuous postproduction schedule shot in early 2005, it was slated for release at the end of 2005, but only turn up eventually 3 years later, on the 29th February 2008, a leap year.Before I say anything, I must first admit I am no fan of the romance genre, so I may be a little biased against this film  I watched it merely because it was a Singapore production, and that it is available for borrowing at my neighborhood library. Heres my two cents on the movie.Let us just start by saying that other than Qi Yuwus KS and Wong LiLin, everybody here of note seems to be a Eurasian. The love interest is a Eurasian Ananda Everingham, and Wongs trio of buddies are all, erhem, Eurasians. Does this film perpetuate the stereotype that falling in love and associating with Eurasians are more in than the common Chinese or whatever Asian race you are? I do not know, it sure seems that way. Also, everyone in the movie speaks in some mystical anglified accent which does not exist anywhere, certainly not in Singapore. It is the kind of semiperfect English that authorities would like us speak, but which does not exist anywhere outside, say, the MTV Channel. The effect is that the dialog of the movie sounds forced and stilted, not helped by the lack of trueblue Singaporeans in the cast.The scriptwriter seems to be trying too hard to string oneliners after oneliners. After twenty minutes, the wit of the movie starts to pall and the film starts serving up its usual plate of clich\u00e9s. I guess I did not enjoy the movie because the entire premise of sustaining a love affair over 16 long years seems unbelievable. There are other incredulities in the film. I cannot for one believe that KS played by Qi Yuwu would fall for one of Wongs girlfriends. And the scene where the bridegroom says, Go, before I change my mind, has been used in a hundred East Asian Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwanese etc TV serials...So 4 stars for this film. The production value is fair, and Wong Lilin tries her best, but she is not helped by the script. Joan Chen has a 15minute bitpart in the movie as the older Wong and is perhaps the best actress of the lot, but, hey, her role is just cameo.If you come across The Leap Years in the rental or library, you may want to pop it in the DVD player for curiositys sake, but otherwise, for people who do not exactly enjoy the romance genre, you can decide whether or not to give it a miss.","label":0},{"index":11574,"txt":"Randolph Scott is leaving the USA for the greener pastures of Canadas British Columbia. He wants to start a cattle ranch there with partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. They stampede their small herd over a toll bridge erected by Victor Jory. Later Jory rustles their cattle and Williams loses his left arm during the fracas.From 1945 until 1962 when he retired, Randolph Scott made a series of good adult themed westerns, some of them considered real classics. Unfortunately the Cariboo Trail will never be listed among his best westerns. It is more like the material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry might use. The story is downright silly at times. Williams who was along for the ride with Scott, he wanted to go prospect for gold as there was a big strike at the time. He does not blame the rustlers, he blames Scott for convincing him to make the trip for the loss of his arm. Also there is a scene in the film when Scott, Lee Tung Foo, and Gabby Hayes are captured by Indians. They escape because Gabbys mule has been taught to kick on command and he kicks away at the Indians allowing our heroes to escape. I am not sure that would have played in a Rogers film.Furthermore the story actually wants you to believe that tyro prospector Randolph Scott accidentally stumbles on a gold strike after just a few lessons from prospector Gabby Hayes on how to find gold. This was Gabby Hayess farewell feature film part. It would have been better had he gone out in a good western and in fact he had done a couple of better ones with Randolph Scott before this.I will say this, though no Caribou made any appearance in the film, this is one of the few Canadian locale films from the past that did NOT have any Mounties.

If your movie has to be described as loosely based on the video game, you have script problems. The black character may not always die first, but the Asian character does always know kungfu. While you may be proud that you figured out how to do the the Matrix effect on a budget, that does not necessarily mean you should use it over and over again ad nausea. Being Ron Howards brother does not guarantee choice roles. Whenever a scene does not edit together, just use some footage from the video game, no one will notice. If your cousins rapmetal band offers to write your movies theme for free, politely decline. Zombie movies are not about people killing zombies. They are about zombies killing people, preferably in the most gruesome way possible. That is what makes them SCARY. White people who can pay 1600 to get to a rave deserve to die.

The soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says  no papa, no mama, no uncle sam and Macarthur gives his little pep talk that Americans would never abandon the Philippines. The scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by Macarthurs words and gives him a smart salute. I mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the U.S. as the great white savior of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake. It showed that Filipinos are damsels in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great Americans solely for redemption. It blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions of the members of the USAFFE United States Armed Forces of The Far East, these are Filipino volunteers that were integrated in the US military during world war 2, who died side by side with the Americans fighting the Japanese, who walked side by side with Americans in the death march of Bataan and defended Corregidor island by launching a guerilla offensive after Macarthur left for Australia with his famous I shall return speech. My late grandfather, a Filipino world war 2 veteran and USAFFE soldier was one of the many who fought the Japanese with honor and love for the home country.

They are out of the platform biz, we could get that for pennies!Basically they tried their best to make a movie that felt like the video game, even down to shooting the combat as if the characters were actually playing the game.The first and major problem is that the original game was horrid. I mean,badmoviemerchandisingmadeintoaworsegameintwoweeksandthenshippe doutandboughtbymoronsandtheirparentsforchristmas horrid. The graphics were boring. The monsters were boring. The levels were boring. The interface was boring. The CASE was boring. In other words, this was a boring game. And that was the ARCADE version. The home version was even worse! With the home version, you did not even get the shotgun to hold in your hand while you were being bored silly by this pointless game! But I digress.The second problem is that they went so far as to actually intercut scenes from actual gameplay during the fight scenes. HUH??? Did not the editor have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was an actual fight going on? Not to mention that EVERY fight was shot from the perspective of a video game, which may explain the tedious use of Matrixstyle effects. The problem with this is that the game was a firstperson shooter the player proceeds from the POV of the character. Maybe that is why they put in the game graphics, to let you know that they were alluding to the game... Right, whatever...Anyway, the only thing that made this ENTIRE experience remotely enjoyable was the fact that everyone in the theatre was making fun of the movie out loud, so my sudden fits of hysterical laughter and general incredulity were taken as commonplace and did not get me kicked out.To sum up, Do not GO SEE THIS MOVIE! Do not even deign to rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of week. Run. Just run.","label":0},{"index":11589,"txt":"I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize movies, but my GOD!!! This was THE worst movie I have ever seen. Bad acting, bad effects, bad script, bad everything! The plot follows a group of teen cliche is on their way to a rave that takes place in broad daylight at a remote island. However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the partygoers, the clan sets off on a mission through a zombieinfested forest. During this crusade, they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids. They also meet up with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors. Basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the house of the dead. This fight came complete with cheesy Hollywood violence, redundant clips from the HOTD video game, and sloppy matrixesque camera rotations. One of the characters even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled! I am supposed to feel sorry for this guy?!?To sum it all up, there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is.

House of the Dead redefines the term bad movie. Other bad movies, such as When A Stranger Calls or Premonition, will actually look much better when compared to House of the Dead. The basic plot of House of the Dead is a group of twentysomethings travel to a remote island to attend the rave of the century. When they get there, they only find some tents, a bar, a stage, and some bloody tshirts. They decide to stay anyway, and they are soon attacked by zombies.There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie. It is not entertaining. Instead, it is painful to watch because of how terrible it is. The acting is unbelievably bad. In a DVD interview, one of the actors claimed that Uwe Boll, the director, is not afraid to tell someone when they are doing a good job or a bad job in a scene. This is a blatant lie. The script appears to have been written by an 11yearold, who decided to include a scene of someone throwing up on a girls chest and to include the hilarious line, it smells like someone farted out here. The characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie. Somewhere along the way, the characters also magically transform into a SWAT team to take down the zombies. It is like they do not even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the head.The scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing. There is something wrong with Uwe Boll. Bolls camera work is astonishingly disjointed. His pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing. Worse yet, Boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the House of the Dead video game into the movie. Quite often, and at the most random times, you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot. It makes no sense. No one in their right mind would think that was a good idea. It is like Boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game. Uwe Boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion 360 degree rotating shots during the action scenes, a la The Matrix. Unfortunately, he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating. The soundtrack to this movie also boggles the mind. Most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track. This also adds to the ensuing headaches caused by the atrocious House of the Dead.House of the Dead is not bad because it is based on a video game. In fact, it has very little to do with the video game. It also does not fit into the category of so bad that it is good. It does however fit into the category of so bad that it is painful. This movie just plain sucks. Uwe Boll should never be let anywhere near another movie set. Even his presence will curse a production. To all the directors out there whenever one of your movies gets a bad review, all you have to do is remember that you did not make House of the Dead and you will feel much better. I will never get those 90 minutes of my life back. To sum it up, words really cannot describe just how bad this movie is. Everyone involved in the production of this film, especially Uwe Boll, should be ashamed of themselves. Although what I have said may make House of the Dead sound funny, it really is not. Nothing about it is funny. Avoid this at all costs.","label":0},{"index":11592,"txt":"Fck Me!

When you cannot help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash littering your screen? House of the Dead struggles to achieve even this low graded level of cinema.From start to end House of the Dead manages to recreate the feeling like you have just woken up to find out that the cat has laid it is curled business neatly on your forehead while you slept. It is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size which they exploit shamelessly whereas the males for their hardcore kickass attitude. I honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture. Uwe Boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie. At least then we will get better acting\u0085 However not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film. It is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as These are zombies, pure and simple and No capn, we must not go there! It is evil!.We all know that Zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning; at best they are a harmless two hours of action, blood and closet terror. Trash, yes, but entertaining trash. Not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it across the room and smothers your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins.

One must understand that this movie was never meant to be taken seriously. It is camp, along the same lines as Army of Darkness. AoD was silly, but funny and bad in a good way. House of the Dead fails to be good bad..There are qualities inherent in good campy movies, most important of those being believable fantasy. One needs to believe what is happening in a movie to see the humor when a situation goes incredibly wrong. Without boundaries, the movie becomes absurd. HotD lacks any believability.Worse still, HotD brings nothing new to the genre, and repeats the same plot twists and character reactions that many horror movies inevitably start to exhibit. For example, all too often, horror movies fall into the trap where the main characters find love amongst the gore and destruction. I do not know about you, but when I am being chased by zombies, I wanna make out with a hot chick. Believe it? No? Then, you probably will not believe it when the characters start sucking each others faces in this movie.Beyond the obvious issues that plague this movie like so many other horror movies, Uwe Boll elected to add scenes from the video game of zombies being shot, randomly whenever a character shoots a zombie in the movie. Not only is there no clear rationale for this artistic choice, but it distracts one from an already unbelievable plot. Further, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting, and seemingly no attempts by the director to guide the actors reactions to events... leaving the movie with no redeeming qualities.

Scott played the title role in Patton, you saw him directing tanks with pumps of his fist, shooting at German dive bombers with a revolver, and spewing profanity at superiors and subordinates alike. The most action we get from Gregory Peck as MacArthur, a figure from the same war of debatably greater accomplishment, is when he taps mapboards with his finger and raises that famous eyebrow of his.Comparing Pecks performance with Scotts may be unfair. Yet the fact MacArthur was made by the same producer and scored by the same composer begs parallels, as does the fact both films open with the generals addressing cadets at West Point. It is clear to me the filmmakers were looking to mimic that Oscarwinning film of a few years before. But while Peck looks the part more than Scott ever did, he comes off as mostly bland in a story that feels less like drama than a Wikipedia walkthrough of MacArthurs later career.To this day there are those who think he was a dangerous demagogue and others who say he was one of the greatest men who ever lived, an opening title crawl tells us. It is a typical dishwater bit of postVietnam sophistry about those who led Americas military, very much of its time, but what we get here is neither view. MacArthur as presented here does not anger or inspire the way he did in life.Director Joseph Sargent, who went on to helm the famous turkey Jaws The Revenge, does a paintbynumbers job with bland battle montages and some obvious set use as when the Chinese attack U.S. forces in Korea, while the script by Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins trots out a MacArthur who comes across as goodnatured to the point of blandness, a bit too caught up in his public image, but never less than decent.Here you see him stepping off the landing craft making his return to the Phillipines. There you see him addressing Congress in his Old Soldiers Never Die speech. For a long stretch of time he sits in a movie theater in Toyko, waiting for the North Koreans to cross the 38th parallel so we can get on with the story while newsreel footage details Japans rise from the ashes under his enlightened rule. Pecks coactors, Marj Dusay as his devoted wife you are my finest soldier and Nicolas Coaster as a loyal aide, burnish teary eyes in the direction of their companions magnificence but garner no interest on their own.Even when he argues with others, Peck never raises his voice and for the most part wins his arguments with thunderous eloquence. When Admiral Nimitz suggests delaying the recapture of the Philippines, a point of personal pride as well as tactical concern for MacArthur, MacArthur comes back with the comment Just now, as I listened to his plan, I thought I saw our flag going down. Doubtless the real Nimitz would have had something to say about that, but the character in the movie just bows his head and meekly accepts the insult in the presence of President Roosevelt.The only person in the movie who MacArthur seriously disagrees with is Harry S Truman, who Ed Flanders does a fine job with despite a prosthetic nose that makes him resemble Toucan Sam. Trumans firing of MacArthur should be a dramatic high point, but here it takes place in a quiet dinner conversation, in which Peck plays MacArthur as nothing less than a genial martyr.I have never been sold by Pecks standing at the upper pantheon of screen stars; he delivers great presence but lacks complexity even in many of his bestknown roles. But it is unfair to dock him so much here, as he gets little help defining MacArthur as anything other than a speechifying bore. Except for two scenes, one where he rails against the surrender of the Philippines He struck Old Glory and ran up a bedsheet! and another where he has a minibreakdown while awaiting the U.S. invasion of Inchon, inveighing against Communists undermining him at the White House, Peck really plays Peck here, not the complex character who inspired the famous sobriquet American Caesar. The real MacArthur might have been worthy of such a comparison. What you get here is less worthy of Shakespeare than Shakes the Clown.","label":0},{"index":11599,"txt":"This is by far THE WORST movie i have ever watched.

That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there. From Romeros Dead trilogy to 28 days later. However upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory. There is no horror here folks. Just some halfway decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last... and last... and last... and soon you get the feeling maybe you are DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie. It is a pity. I think anyone could find a better use for 7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o crud.

Sure, they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie, as though justifying any particular scene of violence, but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same, with the hand in the bottom on the screen, supposedly your own, holding whatever weapon and gooing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be.It is an interesting premise in House of the Dead, with a lot of college kids LOADED college kids, as it were, kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like 1,500 just for a ride after they miss their boat trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year. The first thing that comes to mind about House of the Dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations. At least in this case, the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed. They look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little haltertops, but at least they THOUGHT they were dressed for the occasion.Clint Howard, tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far, delivers an absolutely awful performance, the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie. I cannot stand it when wellknown actors change their accents in movies, it is so rarely effective, and Howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an wellknown actor pretend that he is this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air. He did not even rasp well. It sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something. Real tough there, Clint! I expected more from him, but then again, he did agree to a part in this mess.Once we get to the island, the movie temporarily turns into any one of the Friday the 13th movies that took place at Camp Crystal Lake. Lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed. The nudity was impressive, I guess, but let us consider something for a minute. These kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the Rave Of The Year, find NO ONE, and say, well, who wants a beer! Even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there did not think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight. Here you have the input from director Uwe Boll  There is alcohol! They will not notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves!So not only do they start drinking, not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island, but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along, the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they are alone. It is like they expected to find the island empty, and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while, they would have some privacy since there is no one else around. Brilliant!Now for the things that everyone hated, judging by the reviews that I have read about the movie. Yes, intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie, mostly in order to show that, yes, the movie was being faithful todirectly copying the video game. Sure, it was a stupid idea. I cannot imagine who thought up that little nugget, but worse than that is the Matrixstyle bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over. After the first time at which point I found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film.One of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans, who are much faster but getting tired, running out of places to run, and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with. The first two are done right in the movie, the kids are terrified and do not have a lot of places to run since they are on an island, but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler, they find themselves heavily armed. And I mean that very strongly. I mean, these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades, which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead.Then you have what I call the technoslasher scene. Since the rave never happened, and I guess since Uwe Boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie, there is one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead, and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video. There is techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it is nothing but a blur of gory shot, mostly only about 5 frames long which is about 16 of a second flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music. Clever, I guess, but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the grossout effect because you cannot see any one thing for long enough to react to it. You are just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie.I have seen a lot of people compare this movie to Resident Evil, mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it, and they are exactly right. I appreciate that at least here, as was not the case in Resident Evil, it was not some manmade virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people, changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires. 28 Days Later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie, it is just too bad that House of the Dead did not do a single original thing, except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based, just in case you forget. I really think that this should have been a much better movie. While obviously I cannot say that I know much about the game it is based on, just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie, but unfortunately I think that is more often the case than not with horror movies. It is really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a noholdsbarred horror film, and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot, which suggests the possibility of a sequel.","label":0},{"index":11603,"txt":"Ok, first of all, I am a huge zombie movie fan.

You kids today with your hulahoops and your miniskirts and your Pat Boone\u0085 After bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there a stupidity which begs its own network of rhetoric, they find the rave deserted.Passing mention is made of a house \u0096 presumably the titular House Of The Dead \u0096 but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locales divorced from any semblance of haunted residence.A fallen video camera acts as flashback filler, showing the island in the throes of a \u0096 party?! Is that it? Oh, so this rave thingy is just a party? In the grand tradition of reeuphemizing used cars as preowned, or shell shock as posttraumatic stress disorder, the word party is now too square for you drugaddled, siliconeimplanted, metrosexual jagoffs? It is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies. Intelligent thought stops here\u0085I do not think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie reanimation. Zombies cannot die \u0096 they are already UNDEAD. They do not bleed, they know no pain. Unless their bodies are completely annihilated, they will continue being animated. At least, that is what my Jamaican witch priestess tells me.Which means that a .45 shot into their hearts is not going to stop them, nor will a machete to the torso. And a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly NOT bring forth gouts of blood. At least in the video games logic, the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated, leaving a fetid mush that cannot reanimate itself.Yet each actorslashmodel gets their Matrixcircularcamera moment, slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum. Seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the Stormtroopers from Return Of The Jedi, who get knocked out when Ewoks trip them.I suppose the films writer, Mark Altman, having penned the nottooshabby Free Enterprise, felt compelled to insert a Captain Kirk reference, in the character of Jurgen Prochnow, who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dungswill. There is also a reference to Prochnows primo role in the magnificent Das Boot, when one of the untrained Bactors mentions that he looks like a UBoat Captain. . I wonder how many of this movies target audience of squareeyed swine picked up on ANY of the snide references to other films, as when Prochnow declares, Say hello to my little friend, presaging his machine gun moment. Aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the Sisyphean futility of the videogame concept i.e. the game ends when you die \u0096 you cannot win, this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart. Accordingly, everyone dies in due course, except for a heterosexual pair of Attractive White People.A better use for this films scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through Acting School, although Ona Grauers left breast did a good job, as did her right breast \u0096 and those slomo running scenes priceless!

Also, all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. And the way the people die is so stupid. It is like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on. And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open, So dumb.FINAL VERDICT If any of these actors appear in another film, then they have been blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst film I have seen in years. A Bmovie on cinemax is better.","label":0},{"index":11606,"txt":"There are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from frame one. Even if you were totally oblivious of Ed Woods work, one look at that commentator from Plan 9 from outer space and you just KNOW you are not gonna see the next cinematic masterpiece. Just like that, when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls masterpiece House of Dead, with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from Sin City, I knew I am in for a helluva ride.So, the movie starts like this  first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die. You know, to keep you wandering. Then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like Karma..thinks she is Foxy Brown or Alicia..my ex.. we broke up recently.. I had to study and she had to fence. No, I am not kidding.Anyway, this bunch of 20somethings who could not act their way out of a wet paperbag are going to the Rave of the century, rave in question being a few tents, a portapotty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the Pacific. Our gang missed the ferry, but thankfully will find a way to get there, the way being a fisherboat ran by Kirk Cpt Kirk? Get it? Man, whoever wrote this script is a genius and his sidekick who is a bastard child of Simpsons Cpt McAllister and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer.To make the long story short, the gang gets to the island, finds nobody there except some bloody Tshirts and then decide to run the hell away from there. No wait, they do not, they actually get all happy and like cos there is free booze.With that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill. Some guys in rubber suits start running around, there is some screaming and shooting, our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang, they go out of the house, meet Cpt Kirk and some police woman who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons and then decide to go back to the house. Somewhere along the line they transform into a S.W.A.T. team, enter the Matrix, the rubbersuit guys start multiplying like bacteria and I start to cry because I actually paid to see this. To add insult to the injury, every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute gameover cutscene for a few characters when they die.I seriously hate this movie. It does not even fit in that famed So bad it is good category. It is just plain bad. The script is bad, the zombies are awful, there is no tension, lines are bad, actors are bad.. the list just goes on.You will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful. Do not. There are bad movies that deserve to be watched. This is not one of them.","label":0},{"index":11607,"txt":"There are people out there who will greenlight anything! That is the only explanation I can offer as to why the House of the Dead movie exists. And that is only scary part to the whole movie. It is so bad you will go off movies forever. I seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the TV over to the Paint Drying channel but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing. I do not know why I do these bad things to myself.As if it matters, heres the basic jist of the story. A group of twentysomethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the Pacific Northwest Canada actually, because it is cheap for the Rave of the Century which consists of about 8 people and unraving music that they pay some craggy old fisherman 1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry. That is gotta be some rave to be worth all that dough! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead hang onI thought this was HOUSE of the Dead? and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda.First faults here. Why would a tiny little rave of the Century my foot! be held on some remote island? Why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it? Why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others?Once they arrive they discover that the rave which consists of about 2 tents, a small stage and a portajohn has been smashed, there is blood everywhere and no one is around. What would any rationally thinking person do? Run for their lives of course. But no, these clueless, obviously blind people decide to go look for them. Soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that is 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside. Another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows, as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters, and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again. The characters, like the movie, go nowhere.Jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue, heinous acting, mumbojumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the oncepopular arcade game of the same name. Why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers I will never know. The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further, if that is at all possible.It has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap, throwaway line at the end. It makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory. Hell, even the Double Dragon movie seems multiOscar worthy in comparison to this junk. The only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is Jurgen Prochnow. He could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character. The rest of the cast suck I am afraid. The characters are idiots and deserve to die.Plus, if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity, I see no reason why this film cannot be shown on Saturday morning TV. It is not frightening in the slightest. Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film. And where did all those bad guys come from anyway? There were only a few people on the island to begin with. I guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over. I kid you not, you will see the same zombie die a dozen times.Who is ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid? None other than director Uwe Boll. His control over the movie is nonexistent. You can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies are not really taking it all seriously. The actors seem like they are reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card. It all feels very unnatural.Plus the film is shot like a twopart miniseries. I have indeed seen better TV productions. And do not get me started on the editing. The film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans. No real skill or talent was put into making this at all. It truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and George A. Romero cannot even get anyone to take his calls. House of the Dead makes some idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be postmodern but it only irritates that they think THIS is in the same league as a REAL zombie movie.For what it is worth, the 1.851 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily overused ADR even more. The DVD comes with extras but why torture yourself. Is not this review warning enough? Stay away! You are all doomed I tell you! Doomed! Doomed!!!","label":0},{"index":11608,"txt":"Lynn Hollister, a smalltown lawyer, travels to the nearby big city on business connected with the death of his friend Johnny. Yes, Lynn is a man despite the femininesounding Christian name. Were the scriptwriters trying to make a snide reference to the fact that John Waynes birth name was Marion? Hollister at first believes Johnnys death to have been an accident, but soon realises that Johnny was murdered. Further investigations reveal a web of corruption, criminality and election rigging connected to Boss Cameron, the leading light in city s political machine.That sounds like the plot of a gritty crime thriller, possibly made in the film noir style which was starting to become popular in 1941. It is not. A Man Betrayed, despite its theme, is more like a light romantic comedy than a crime drama. Hollister falls in love with Camerons attractive daughter Sabra, and the film then concentrates as much on their resulting romance as on the suspense elements.This film might just have worked if it had been made as a straightforward serious drama. One reviewer states that John Wayne is not at all believable as a lawyer, but he could not play a cowboy in every movie, and a tough crusading lawyer taking on the forces of organised crime would probably have been well within his compass. Where I do agree with that reviewer is when he says that Wayne was no Cary Grant impersonator. Romantic comedy just was not up his street. One of the weaknesses of the studio system is that actors could be required to play any part their bosses demanded of them, regardless of whether it was up their street or not, and as Wayne was one of the few major stars working for Republic Pictures they doubtless wanted to get as much mileage out of him as they could.That said, not even Cary Grant himself could have made A Man Betrayed work as a comedy. That is not a reflection on his comic talents; it is a reflection on the total lack of amusing material in this film. I doubt if anyone, no matter how well developed their sense of humour might be, could find anything to laugh at in it. The films lighthearted tone does not make it a successful comedy; it just prevents it from being taken seriously as anything else. This is one of those films that are neither fish nor flesh nor fowl nor good red herring. 310","label":0},{"index":11609,"txt":"Although I have to admit I laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies I saw.The budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors.

The movie focuses on a Dungeons and Dragonsstyle game that eventually drives our young Gump to hallucinatory madness. The story is charmingly early 1980s, focusing as it does on the imminent threat to our youth posed by those evil roleplaying games.I, however, prefer to view Mazes and Monsters as the turning point in the Whatever Happened to Chris Makepeace? story. we all remember him as Rudy the Rabbit in Meatballs and as the hapless Clifford in My Bodyguard, where he gave us all a vicarious thrill by beating the crap out of Matt Dillon. Few could argue especially those of us who read Dynamite! on a regular basis that great things were in store for him.And then came Rona Jaffe. The line between bad acting and bad writing is razor thin, so I leave it to you to decide whose fault Makepeaces performance in this is. All I know is that the last major release I saw him in was Vamp, and that was 1986. He had a small role as Sean Penns brother in Falcon and the Snowman, but by that time the Brat Pack torch had been passed to others with straighter hair and flashier resumes.I cannot in good conscience recommend this movie.

Robbie Wheeling has had problems in the past playing this game at other colleges and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good grades. Robbie meets a very nice gal and has a romantic fling with her and once he starts playing the game, he stops making love to her and acts like a Monk.

I had no knowledge of the Roleplaying controversy behind it or the fact that it was a MadeForTV movie. When I looked at the cover the updated DVD one I seriously thought it would be another Fantasy adventure like Legend, with Tom Hank as the nerdy hero from 1980s earth entering a mythical world to save a princess from an evil maze filled with monsters. Sounds exciting, right? That is what the cover suggests to you at first glance. I was given this movie as a gift, obviously under the same premise because my aunt knows I am into action movies with a medieval myth theme. And it has Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors. So I popped this movie in, expecting a feel good movie with Tom Hanks in a 80s special effects world that would be good for a laugh.No! None of this happens. Now before I continue I will confess, I am a nerd but I have no interest in Roleplaying games. That is all this movie is about so my interest in the content is lukewarm at best. And MM copyright infringement? is not even a feel good roleplaying based movie with lovable geeks that uses their imagination to enter a world of awesomeness. No! This is an AntiRoleplaying movie that must have been made by some Religious folk the same people who also think Barney is the work of Satan. I understand, Satan is a crafty fellow but I do not think he is desperate enough for soul to lull RPG lovers into worship him. This movie is THEE antigamer movie. This is what I get from this movie it hates RPGs and not only does it make fun of the people engaging in Roleplaying but it makes poor Tom Hanks a mental patient.Tom had an excuse to talk to a volleyball in Castaway, poor guy was alone but Tom somehow made his insanity fun and you literally saw the Volleyball as a lovable character through Toms good acting. I wish I watched that movie instead of this. In this movie, Tom is attacked by a make believe dragon creature it looks like a poorly made mascot for a RPG team and has a split personality that is creepy at best. Toms acting only exceeds to make you feel bad for his character and nothing else. I get that the poor guy lost his brother and is not right in the head because of it so the movie does win points for being intentionally tragic. I am not one for films that exploit mental illness and the ending to MM made me feel like crp. Luckily I watched Hudson Hawk afterwards and got a good laugh before my soul was crushed any further. Yah, HH surpasses MM by . . . a LOT! This is not one of Toms better films. In fact it is thee most depressing movie I have ever seen him in Even Saving Private Ryan is not this depressing. I walked in hoping to watch a feel good movie and I ended up feeling the exact opposite. If you want to watch a sad both emotionally and visually movie then by all means watch this.

Tom Hanks is arguably the worst off, having just failed out of another school and still dealing with a brother who disappeared and may be dead. Its mentioned a couple of times that they play the game to work through problems in their real lives. And sure enough, at the end, when they go to see Robbie Hanks, they are all happy and welladjusted, embarking on their adult careers, problems solved, games put away Daniel does not even want to design computer games any more, and even Robbies mother, who is been constantly drunk and dissatisfied, is suddenly the Happy Homemaker, looking fresh and bright and arranging flowers. Sure, JJ suddenly and quite cheerfully it seems decides to commit suicide, but the reason seems to be entirely because he is a lonely boy genius who cannot get a date, and not because his character dies, as in the famous Jack Chick tract which happens afterward anyways, and it almost seems like he does it on purpose so he can end Daniels game and get everyone to come play his. In fact, the prospect of liveaction role playing in the caverns seems to be the only thing that saves him from killing himself! And in what may be the coolest tableau scene in the whole movie, Kate, looking very fetching in chain mail, looks right at the camera and says something like, The scariest monsters are the ones in our own minds. The biggest fantasy element in this movie is the two muggers passing up the rich couple so they can rob the dirty, homelesslooking guy of his magic beans. The recurring theme a The Way We Were for the 80smight have been poignant at the end, but as a way to kick off a movie is downright depressing and seems out of place. And for one final mystery, our hero, wearing full Pardu regalia, has a psychotic break, becomes his character completely and embarks on his quest, so of course the first thing he does is change into 20century street clothes. So maybe the movies irrational, but I guess its dealing with an irrational topic. In those days a circle of kids with dice and pencils was regarded as tainted and possibly possessed, and you could go insane if they spoke their mumbojumbo at you. The antigame paranoia is pretty much summed up in the first scene, where the reporter asks the cop whats going on, the cop says a kids lost in the tunnels and there is a chance Mazes and Monsters is somehow involved. The reporter admits to being vaguely familiar with the game although he allows his own children to play it, then turns to the camera and reels off a polished spiel that blames the game for everything and admits no possibility of another explanation. In the end, its no masterpiece, but interesting as madeforTV movies go.","label":0},{"index":11631,"txt":"I did not even know this was originally a madefortv movie when I saw it, but I guessed it through the running time. It has the same washedout colors, bland characters, and horrible synthesized music that I remember from the 80s, plus a social platform that practically screams Afterschool special. Anyhoo.Rona Jaffes thank you Mazes and Monsters was made in the heyday of Dungeons  Dragons, a penandpaper RPG that took the hearts of millions of geeks around America. I count myself one of said geeks, tho I have never played DD specifically I have dabbled in one of its brethren. MM was also made in the heyday of DDs major controversythat it was so engrossing that people could lose touch with reality, be worshiping Satan without knowing, blah blah. I suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point, if extremely rarebut it dates this movie horrendously.We meet 4 young college students, who play the aptly named Mazes and Monsters, to socialize and have a little time away from mundane life. Except that MM as presented is more boring than their mundane lives. None of the allure of gaming is presented hereand Jay Jays request to take MM into the real world comes out of nowhere. It is just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere alsothough at that point we do not really care. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel are supposed to be differentbut they are all rich WASPy prigs who have problems no one really has.But things just continue, getting worse in more ways than one. The low budget comes dreadfully clear, I love the Entrance sign and cardboard cutout to the forbidden caverns RobbiePardu shows why he is not a warrior in the oafiest stabbing scene ever, and the payoff atop the Two Towers is unintentionally hilarious. Tom Hanks blubbering Jay Jay, what am I doing here? made me laugh for minutes on end. Definitely the low point in his career.Do not look at it as a cogent satire, just a laughable piece of 80s TV trash, and you will still have a good time. That is, if you can stay awake.

Hardly original.All the characters outside of Jeremy Davies filmmaker are as thin as ricepaper. Characters that might be interesting, such as his father, his doppelganger, or Jason Schwarzmann as a hack director are introduced and then shown the door without adding a thing.This movie is full of eye candy but when compared to other films about filmmakers such as Stardust Memories or 8 12 it pales in comparison. Those movies are funny, provocative with welldeveloped characters. Those movies have lessons that apply outsideThe movie wants to be comic and campy but its just derivative and there is not one funny scene. The filmmakers describe it as a sendup but what is the satirical target? The actors say it is an homage but I think I would rather a fulllength version of CodenameDragonfly.Coppola is clearly amused by the setting as is evident by the visual humor of the scifi movie within a movie. But he fails to share why we should be amused.Outside of the scifi movie its just a mess. There are continuity errors, the filmmaker chooses a scifi weapon after its already been chosen. What?Just because he has a scene were the filmmaker is confronted by the critics complaining about the lack of story, lack of a point, a scene where he admits empty cleverness does not mean that he has addressed those criticisms.I guess if your Roman Coppola you can get away with making a movie about an angstridden idealistic filmmaker who does not know what he wants to say and so ends up saying nothing.

His father makes great films. His sister made a good one. But brother Roman? NO! One critic had the audacity to compare this film to Godards Le M\u00e9pris Contempt. While Coppola, Jr. did take the same idea, a film about film, he tried too hard to make himself seem European, artsy, and witty, when it is all really just kitsch. The lead actor carries the same expression through the whole film, like he is either in awe or in shock of this film being made around him. Schwartzman somehow manages to pull off his role as a flamboyant director. Depardieu is alright. The one scene that has any real film spoof humor at all is, surprisingly, not the Bmovie scenes, but rather one which takes place in Italy; a montage of shots of several various characters inside a very small car, driving around picking up and dropping off random people. This was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema I am guessing he was trying to spoof. Or ripoff. Or both. The documentary with the lead talking into the camera and filming various objects has been played out, the ending was tagged on for the sake of a twist or artistic value... I suppose the funniest thing about this film was the film itself, and not in the way it intended. No wonder this film was sent back after a festival screening to be reedited or reshot or whatever, which makes me curious as to just how bad it was before. I cannot believe it could have been worse than this. If you want to see a good parody of film check out the Austin Powers films. Any of them.

Let us see the lead male actor, supposedly a director, is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same pitch whatever he says, the lead female actress has an expression on her face that never changes, the plot is totally segmented in bits with perhaps one single connecting element, the movie within the movie idea must be more stale than paleolithic rocks...

In fact the lovestory is a poor mans version of the one in Pearl Harbor and that one was already poor!But as I like watching movies and analyzing their patterns I eventually decided to watch that rubbish.

The movie tries to depict the US government as angels and completely ignores the contribution of other countries during the airlift especially Great Britain who was responsible for nearly a quarter of the rations despite having their country bombed from a country that they are trying to help.What was also pretty annoying were the historical remarks the people said in the movie like when the heroines mother tells her daughter that Germany might be parted in two with a response like That is impossible! Or when Stalin where the director thought we just stick similarly looking mustache on the actor and he WILL look like him says that Russia has to stop Coca Cola from spreading in Germany. Yeah right, if Stalin has ever said something like this. Or there is this one US pilot who tells his fellow of a bread with meat and everything possible in it  please!

Also relationships between US soldiers and German civilians was not allowed and by a revealing of such a relationship the US soldier would have been sent home.

Earp told the director about the stagecoach, and how it was planned to happen during the stagecoach arrival, so despite what other historians claim, Wyat himself asserts that it was premeditated.This movie portrays Earp as an honest man, and also his brothers. History does not exactly say they were or were not. Most people like to interject a bit of deceit and lawlessness into their characters, but that is nothing new. The truth is probably closer to them being the law abiding sorts of GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL. Men who saw it as a career, and believe me, in the old West, you did not have time to think about too much else.Characters that do not exist, characters depicted dying at the corral who really did not, all make this a weaker film. It is further weakened by Mature, who really did not make a convincing Doc. He may be the worst cast choice ever for Doc, but at the same time we must remember that older movies were closer to the era and closer to a feel for the truth. After all, ford did get information first hand from Wyatt Earp.It is also weakened by the all so predictable events involving the Mexican girl. Hollywood was very pro Nazi in those days, and ready to kill off brunette women in very predictable fashion to show their patronage to Hitler idealism. This occurs in most movies until the eighties.

I should have known better. Not quite a remake, and more of a parody than a homage, this show did not quite know how to play it, and plumped with infantile comedy and cartoon plots and characters. The three main characters were little more than caricatures of the actors, and only Emilia Fox could act Bob Mortimer is painful in a straight role. The supporting cast were merely comedianacquaintances of Vic and Bobs wanting to be part of the injoke, and far too aware of the situation to be convincing. And the CGI, though the effects could not help be an improvement on those available 30 years earlier, merely dazzled the viewer with lights and camera work, and did little to mask the poor quality of the scripts and dialogue. All style and no substance. And whereas the 1960s show is mocked for being very much of its time, this update is now also very dated, with Matrixstyle fashions, obligatory girl power scenes, and less than subtle tension between the two living leads.","label":0},{"index":11662,"txt":"The Bank 1915, Chaplin The Bank was one of Charlies 1915 Essanay films. While these group of films are more watchable than their 1914 counterparts, this one seems a bit below average. The gag with the janitorial double combolocked vault and the toughluck ending that has Charlie waking up from a dream, in which he is stroking the lead ladys hair, only to be stroking the head of a mop he had used as a quasi pillow, are both classic Chaplin moments. They are both ironically the beginning and the end. The middle is filled in with fighting with the rival coworker janitor and busting up a bank robbery to win the girl. The mop is probably the greatest physical prop of this movie and Charlie uses it to expert comedic effect whether while it is the intention of his character or not. The mop seems to be Charlies alterego doing things he wishes he could do but would not with his own two hands.

The genius who brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of making a 1930s French musical in vibrant colour. The opening voiceover with old, embellished intertitles was a nice touch. Then the camera aperture opens like the old hand crankers on a black  white placard. The camera backs off or rather, up, suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party. This is all in the first 60 seconds.Then the music starts. A rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film and yes, I speak French, so I cannot blame it on the subtitles. Those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song. Then they leave, and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minutes into the film.I am not sure what Resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time  musical cacophony. But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out. I endured.It did not get much better. I will tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters. We do not even see their faces half the time as Resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera. People flit on  off stage like moths around a lamp, and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot.

Although it owed a debt to Tarentinos Pulp Fiction, Ishiis cast was up to the task of carrying the story, and the entire film crackled with energy. The scenes between ASANO Tadanobu and GASHUIN Tatsuya were particularly engaging. There was action, intrigue, bizarre characterizations, enough sex to keep things interesting, and an utterly unpredictable story line.So it was with a certain amount of anticipation and optimism that I began to watch Party 7. And my enthusiasm was certainly piqued with the opening credits, which left my wife and I actually stunned by how dynamic and exciting they were; the mix of anime and liveaction work was brilliant! Then, the actual movie started. Actually, it did not so much start as sort of shuffle in the side door and stand there, fumbling through its pockets, looking uncomfortable.The entire film takes place in three rooms. One is a futuristic voyeurs paradise borrowed a bit from Shark Skin Man..., another is a travel agents office, and the third and far the most used is a seedy hotel room. In that room, a cast of seven characters meets and...does approximately nothing. Really. I am no stranger to talking films. One of my alltime favorites is My Dinner with Andre, the talkiest of all talking films. My Dinner with Andre is far more exciting, and it just has two middleaged men discussing their lives over dinner. The key is that Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn tell interesting stories. The cast of Party 7 literally just whine at each other for the entire film. No, you do not! Yes, I do! No, you really do not! Yes, I really do! No, you really, really do not! Yes, I really... you get the idea, I hope. I wish the directer had.Party 7 is an unbelievably unengaging film. There is only the flimsiest of plots money stolen from the Yakuza, just like in Shark Skin Man..., accompanied by almost no action. There is no interesting dialog. The characters are largely uninteresting. It was as if Ishii took the throwaway conversational moments from Tarentinos films and built an entire film around them. But Tarentinos conversations always have their own internal logic and wit They call it a Royale, with cheese. Not so with the dialog here, which is duller than you can imagine. If it were not for the brief, hilarious cameo from Gashuin who is always marvelous and a lowkey performance from the awesome ASANO Tadanobu, I would have given Party 7 a single star.

As a stand alone film, this movie is mediocre; but as a sequel to the 1976 masterpiece; it is a travesty. The film goes along the same route that many series go down when they are running out of ideas; that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female. It is always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard, the plot lacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a bloodless minimum. The film does keep a thread with the original, which I will not reveal as despite being obvious; that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie. The basics of the plot largely copy Richard Donners original, and see a young couple adopt a child, which they name Delia not Damiella or Damiana, fortunately. There is a big dog involved, and a child minder; and pretty soon, the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal; as she is menstruating at eight years old, and never suffered from any illnesses...The first two sequels to The Omen were not bad at all, and the series really should have ended at number three. I guess there was money involved somewhere down the line, as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made. It brings nothing to the table in terms of originality, and the only thing it is likely to succeed in doing is annoying fans of the series. The film looks and feels like a TV movie all the way through and for the most part plays out like a film about the troubled upbringing of a young girl. Indeed, Asia Vieira does look like a little bitch; but she never convinces that she is the Antichrist, as her stares are redundant and most of the evil she does is laughable. Faye Grant is given the meatiest role, and does not impress; while the rest of the cast regret agreeing to star in such an awful waste of time. The only good thing about this movie is the theme tune, which of course has been ripped off from the original; and is overused. On the whole, this film really is not worth seeing; as it delivers nothing that the series is famous for, and does not even do justice to weaker second sequel.","label":0},{"index":11679,"txt":"On the surface the idea of Omen 4 was good. It is nice to see that the devil child could be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the Exorcist, when girls are possessed or are devilry it is very effective.

She does not look scary or devilish. Rather, she looks sulky and moody.This film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked. But it is rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies, as a made for TV movie special.On so many levels it lets down.

Was not it enough that, over the span of three films prior to this release, we have experienced the rise and fall of Damien Thorn? If you are a horror enthusiast such as myself, you will realize that it is common for a horror movie that has many sequels and prequels to its credit to fade away into redundancy  Children of the Corn, Hellraiser, Phantasm; the list goes on. At this point in the game, I am sure you know what to expect when you are prepared to view the fourth title in a series. Regardless, there are times when you sit back and realize how shameless some filmmakers are. Omen IV The Awakening is just that, too  a shameless money making exercise.This film does not offer anything new or intriguing to the Omen lineup. As unique and genuine as Omen IV tries to be compared to its siblings, the similarities and plot devices are embarrassingly alike. Elements like the guardian dog, the involvement of a priest, the skepticism of the people involved, the decapitation death scene clearly a homage to the original film when the journalist is beheaded by the sheet of glass...even right down to the fathers involvement in politics and prestige within the community make it too predictable. Although it is common to star a BRated cast into a horror title this far into a series, the acting is off the charts, chockfull of ridiculousness and unintentional humor due to some of the poorly delivered lines throughout this film. The atmosphere has completely vanished in comparison to the first three titles. In addition, the epic score composed by Goldsmith in the previous movies has been replaced by an auditory debacle; an absolute joke, and made me wonder if it was actually intended to be used for this film or just pulled from a bank of stock audio...which really says something, because rarely do I comment on the lousy misuse of a musical score  until now.All in all, I would call Omen IV The Awakening a failure. In the world of horror movies that carry a long list of titles behind them, some manage to hit the mark and some do not.

As a serious film Omen IV The AWakening falls flat on it is face  it really does work better if you look at it as a comedy spoof, I mean the scene towards the end when the Detective comes facetoface with a bunch of zombie carol singers who are singing an ominous Gothic song has to be seen to be believed  I thought it was absolutely hilarious  ridiculous in equal measure. Then there is the pointless difference between this  the other Omen films in that this time it is a young girl, the question I ask here is why? Seriously, why?

The best most stylish thing about Omen IV The Awakening is the final shot in which the camera rises up in the air as Delia walks away into the distance to reveal a crucifix shaped cross made by two overlapping paths but this is the very last shot before the end credits roll which says just about everything. I have to mention the music which sounds awful, more suited to a comedy  is very inappropriate sounding. The acting is alright at best but as usual the kid annoys.Omen IV The Awakening is rubbish, it is a totally ridiculous film that tries to be serious  just ends up coming across as stupid.

Poor in every way, do not con people by saying otherwise. Storyline is a weak rehash of the previous entries, script is likewise.

Shame.","label":0},{"index":11690,"txt":"I recently decided to revisit The Omen trilogy only to discover that {insert demonic music here} there is a fourth. I did not expect much from it, and in that respect it certainly lived up to my expectations. If you are into watching bad movies for a laugh, then this just may be the movie for you. Oh, where do we start?From the onset, the made for TV look and feel of the movie was obvious. The music was often inappropriately matched with what was happening in the movie and therefore at best distracting. The script had all the suspense of an 8 yearolds work of fiction. But one thing that must be said is that the lacking script was very well matched up with the appalling acting. Numerous scenes left me contemplating whether it was the script or the acting that was the source of ridiculousness.The story itself is quite thin, centering on all the crazy antics of the daughter of Damien Thorn, adopted out by wrongdoing and badly acted nuns. There is the usual lot of mysterious and convoluted deaths that personally made me yawn as the drama unfolded, and the usual thirdparty investigator into the whole affair. Later, via some medical phenomena, Damien Thorn Jnr is born. And that pretty much wraps up the plot. The whole thing is executed rather badly right from the beginning with the lack of suspense making the movie one monotonous andor ridiculous scene after another. There were many WTF?!? moments too that provides the unintended comedy relief. For example, what is with the major overreaction at the beginning of the movie when the baby scratches the mothers cheek?? Hardly a 360degreeheadturning omen. I also laughed at the overreaction at the baptism. The baby cries, and everyone looks very concerned. The distressed mother runs out of the church and the priest is left looking very alarmed while crossing himself. Huh? Then there is the newage nanny that seems to have carte blanche on exposing an 8 yearold to all kind of alternative spiritualism. I laughed when the nanny suggested bringing the troubled Delia to a psychic fair to meet the nannys hippie friends and the mother just shrugs her shoulders and allows it. Yeah that is groovy, fill my troubled 8 year old daughters head with all this mysticism stuff. That is cool. I do not need to be there. Of course this would be expected from a mother who allows her daughter to adopt a fully grown Rottweiler they encounter on the street that could bite the little girls head off as a snack. The entire scene at the psychic fair is quite comical in a slapstick kinda way, from the horrified reactionary stares of the psychics to Delia, to the ensuing inferno.I also laughed at how the nuns death is considered a freak accident. Here we have a religious zealot, who is described as being part of a cult, who is fanatically preaching in a pit full of rattlesnakes to prove how Gods Glory will protect them. She antagonizes the snakes by handling them and SOMEHOW she is bitten several times. Hardly a freak accident. More like a successful suicide attempt. The snakesvsnun scene was not the only comical death. There is the slowspeed car accident resulting in decapitation in a school parking lot. Then there is the slowmotion demolition ball headed straight for the detective. I believe I may have gone and made a coffee when the slowmotion started only to come back to see the demolition ball still headed straight for the concerned detective. Then there is the quintessential whoshotwho clich\u00e9 death, where a gun goes off and both act as if they have been shot for several seconds while exchanging horrified glances. Then someone goes tumbling down the stairs revealing who the real victim was. Additionally, the death of the priest at the beginning of the movie seemed a little strange and pointless to me. He runs around looking at the architecture of the church. Obviously finding this quite distressing, he eventually collapses, clutching his chest and dies. Apparently something demonic was happening, as this is what the music was suggesting. Ummm. OK. I am surprised that others have reviewed this film favorably and, in particularly, as a worthy sequel. It is difficult not to notice the nonsensical script, the unrealistic acting, and the inappropriate musical score. The movie lacks any suspense, relying heavily on Delias demonic stare to provide a sense of horror, which becomes rather annoying after a short time. Bottom line  This is a bad movie with the only redeeming feature being it is unintended potential for being a comedy.","label":0},{"index":11691,"txt":"The first question that springs to mind after watching this rubbish is who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the Omen name on this movie?

You will thrill to slomo death sequences, the poor victims with mouths agape and waaaaaaaay too much time to contemplate their impending doom, facing the outrageously contrived deliverer of their deaths.

One only hopes that this irony was the motivating force behind the film! This movie was so bad, it forced me to register with IMDb, finally, just so I could trash it. What makes this movie all the more tragic is that it had such GREAT source material! I have never seen a movie where all the elements were so grotesquely mediocre as to render the result less than the sum of its parts.It may seem insignificant, but I would like to start with the score. As the proud owner of a music degree, I must register my indignation! I was torn between laughter and dry heaves as I listened to what John Scheffer did to Goldsmiths brilliant score; it was far more gruesome than any of the burlesque death scenes, and almost as inadvertently comedic. It was by far the most inappropriate score I have heard since, well, I really cannot think of a worse one. Maybe JAWS 4?As for the plot... I am sorry. New Age mysticism??? What ever happened to the gritty realism of the original trilogy? In those films more so in the first two than the third, but still!! the supernatural was for the most part implied, and it was this subtlety that made the movies so eerily believable. Here we have crystals going black calling all Skeksis and Mystics!! and inverted crucifixes galore, even though in certain scenes the crucifux would be perfectly normal but for the camera angle.

One man is stopped from completing the assault when someone throws a dagger at him, but he is reprimanded only with you cannot force a woman to love you rather than you should never force a woman sexually, you jerk... From a womans point of view, the movie is a let down. It sort of throws a bone to women in letting them be both skilled fighters and leaders, but the movie is much more defined by the romance  which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power, with men dominating the woman they love. This amazing martial arts fighter does not use any of her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers. She never even makes them apologize  rather, SHE seems apologetic.

His turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion. Hero was his worst film since Operation Cougar, with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a John Agar film. Shi Mian Mai Fu is no different. As an American who has been studying Chinese films for a few years now and understands and can speak some Mandarin, I am sure my opinion is different from many others as I am coming from a different background. SMMF, like Hero, is not really a traditional a kung fu film, and it is certainly not a wuxia pian film. There are no sword  sorcery or chivalry elements here. This is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as A Chinese Ghost Story all 3, The Butterfly Murders, Green Snake, et al. While those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do, SMMF features bland, and sometimes laughable, dialogue combined with cardboard acting. Zhang Ziyi plays a blind person about as well as Ben Affleck. There is an air of superiority with this film that is really quite insulting. It takes itself so seriously, it just becomes a huge joke by the end. All the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history, they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions, and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if Zhang Yimou was making a film per se, or simply a showcase i.e. an ego booster for Zhang Ziyi. The camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film. Her acting range really has not extended past her ability to play a naive witch. She is so concentrated on her acting, she comes across as cold and lifeless, as though she is reading her lines from a notecard. It is so funny to hear American critics and film people like the completely clueless Quentin Tarantino call this film a masterpiece. I guess if they see a bunch of Asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest, they are tricked into thinking it is brilliant filmmaking. Ching Siu Tungs choreography, while still retaining his trademark style, editing, and postures, lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like A Chinese Ghost Story, Dragon Inn, and Duel to the Death. Sadly to say, the wirework in this film is really subpar, and if there is subparobvious wirework, then you probably should not have filmed it at high speed. The same goes for the special effects which have a distinct Bmovie feel to them. Beans, daggers, bowls, arrows, swords, and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown with no regard for logic, turning, climbing, and banking as though there is a little pilot inside. I know that logic does not really hold a place in stylized Chinese martial arts films, but if you do not want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience, then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more. Mass melodrama, unintentionally funny dramatic moments, boring fight scenes, really uninspired plot twists are what await you with Shi Mian Mai Fu. It is obvious that Zhang Yimou is no longer making movies for Chinese audiences. This is meant to crack into the Western market just as CTHD did. After watching Hero and SMMF, I have come to the conclusion that if Zhang Yimou wants to make Hollywood films, he is definitely off to the right start. SMMF is basically The Phantom Menace of Chinese martial arts films.

It might have worked if Daggers was purely an action flick and not a romance, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between either of the couples, whatever exists between Mei and her men seems to be more lust than love, and for the most part the dialogue is just silly. This may be just a problem with translation, but the frequent usage of the word flirt in particular reminded me of 8th grade, not headoverheels, together forever, worthdyingfor love; I also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor. The audience is given very little about the characters to really care about, and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole. I was wishing for a remote control to fast forward, I was slumped in my seat ready to snore, but mostly I just cringed a lot.spoilerNow, the icing on the cake. Or rather, adding insult to injury. The ending was truly one of the most horrible, laughable ones I have ever seen. The boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other. Oh, and then it starts to snow. Randomly. Oh, and then Mei dagger embedded in heart suddenly pops up out of the weeds. Then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it is destination, even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet. Wow, cool.Well, then Mei dies finally I guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death. Jin sings, sobs, holds her body close, screen goes blank. I, and the people surrounding me, are chuckling. Not a good sign.Visually stunning, but ultimately a failure.","label":0},{"index":11717,"txt":"I gave this a 1.

Though the main plot of the movie is potentially good, there are all sorts of unrelatedunnecessary subplots. The marketing people in Hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys, perpetual doublecrosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex. It is odd that we see more of them having sex than we did of the President and his mistress. The many plots and subplots make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed  I really did not feel like I knew any character, except that everyone is corrupt and evil. The ending is totally incomplete  it left me more than just wanting what might have been, but what was supposed to be. In the end, there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do, except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a doublecross. I am surprised that so many established and good actors agreed to make such a hollow movie.

It is a draub, basic, go to cabin movie with no intensity or effort.THE SCREENPLAY I usually give credit to indie screenwriters, it is hard work when you are starting out...but this is crap. The story is flat  it leaves you emotionless the entire movie. The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable boasting lines of Woah, you totally freaked me out and I was wondering if you would uh...if you would like to..uh, would you come to the cabin with me?. It makes me want to rip out all my hair, one strand at a time and feed it to myself.THE CHARACTERS HOLY CRAP!!!! Some have described the characters as flat, I want to take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse character arch.. They actually start working on a parallel universe and almost start acting backwards...THE ACTORS Worse than the characters are the actors. They take already poor written characters and add in terrible high school drama acting. The Woah you totally freaked me out was said so monotone and slow  like it was dumbed down. I could complain for hours on the actors alone.TECHNICAL LIGHTING An eight year old would be disappointed with lighting on this movie. Too shadowy in areas, too bleached in others. The director should not use light as an emotion until he learns how to light a basic scene properly. Baby Steps! SOUND How many sound guys does it take to make a really shotty sounding movie? 9. With that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has occured. There is one scene in particular that really sticks out, these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle....WEAK!

On another note the special effects were insanely cheesy and the whole thing looked like it had been shot with a camera anyone can buy a radio shack.The clown himself looks nothing like the one on the video cover. Heck he does not even show up in the film until near the end and all he does it hum songs and go around stalking a few characters. There is no real murder shown either so this is not a real slasher film either Since I have seen it I have questioned a few things 1. If is Serial Insane Clown Killer Would not that be a Serial Killer who kills clowns? 2. If your friend goes missing why would you go out into the woods to have sex rather than look for her? Sad really.3. Why is it that the only REAL acting sputtered vainly out at the end all of a sudden? Did the cast finally decide to show effort in their jobs? This film is as sad as they come.

The basic plot is that a guy Brandon takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work. After picking up a girl on the way there, things start going badly wrong for all of them.The storyline alone written by the actor playing Brandon, I believe, although I could be wrong here is unlikely and unconvincing, and is acted out accordingly. The Clown Killer himself is a rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being a dark, mysterious but most of all, intelligent predator, we are instead offered a rather clumsy, nursery rhymesinging buffoon who appears to be going through a minor mid life crisis. The only thing that warranted the writing of this comment were the sex scenes and whatever gore there was in the film the quality of the film led me to derive some enjoyment out of such things.In short, this film falls below every possible set standard. Admittedly, I was sharing a few beers with a close friend as I watched this, so we managed to scrape together some relative entertainment value out of this film and it is therefore only fair to mention that S.I.C.K did fall just shy of a two rating.

He puts on the gladiators helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers.This thing is just so utterly senseless it is maddening. Heres a short list of things that do not make any sense1 A guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside. The guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside. Then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent  arriving the next morning?!? He was only 50 feet away!2 These two dunderheads then hear another girl scream What, 100 feet away?, but do not investigate because they are afraid they will get lost.3 Another guy and a girl are walking around, and in about their 10th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances, protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor. I mean, what the...? First off, that is just a really stupid thing to say, secondly he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together.4 A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and he stops her, telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing. Um, yeah, we kinda noticed she is wounded and not dead because she is up and walking around. But, thanks for that tidbit of information.5 One girl is tied up in Demonicus lair, and when someone attempts to free her, she instead instructs this person to go and get help. Um, look, idiot, if she set you free, which would take about 5 seconds, there would be no need to get help.And it just goes on and on. The whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods, then they fight, then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends, then they wander around some more. It is just so damned boring and pointless that I turned the DVD off halfway through. None of these characters are sympathetic, especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time. Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him  he looks like a kid in a Halloween costume, scrunching his face up to look evil. He runs, or should I say scampers around like he is gay. The special effects are comedic, the acting is for the most part awful, and nothing makes any sense.Overall, maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it, getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue, creating characters with actual likable personalities, having some sort of logical flow to the action, and maybe even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit.

The actors in this movie especially Brandon are so fake that it is funny. And especially that Tracy girl whenever she is in the boarded up room telling the clown to go away. They show almost no emotion and it is just so obvious that they are acting. And also when the clown is looking through that black box paper thing and grabs Mark, he does not even look like he is scared even though the clown like grabbed him and started attacking him. And seriously, would you just be JOGGING if you were being chased down? I would be sprinting for my life! Even though anyone could probably outrun that clown because he is like 300 lbs. Not to mention that the effects are not that great, like whenever the clown chops off Susans head in the forest, then whenever he throws her head into the boarded up room with Denise and Tracy whenever Denise throws the head back over. Also like in the previous guys comment, the beginning makes absolutely NO sense and I do not even see why it was even included in the movie. So what, was this movie made in 2003? The music made it sound like it was made in like the 1980s, and the cameraing? does not even really look professional. Half of the time, it seems like the camera cannot even stay steady when it is suppose to be. Overall, I would have to say I enjoyed the movie.

But when they began to disappear onebyone, replaced by scattered, bloodied body parts and voodoo effigies, the remaining few scramble for their lives. But he is out there. And he is sick. And all he wants is blood... So obviously from the getgo it does not make sense why is this clown in the woods to begin with? Why a clown? Why are their dolls with the word food drawn on them? Why why why? Hardly anything gets answered in this 1 hour 30 min. bore fest except where this clown lives. The characters are dumb guys, dumb girls, and a hell of a lot of bitchiness. One in particular is a girl whom they brought from a restaurant up the road, whom they thought they should help because she was getting hassled by some guy she knew. What warrants that as an excuse to bring a girl into your circle of friends or their cabin? She, of course, begins planting seeds of jealousy, having the men have sex with her by feeding their dumb minds everything they want to hear.The music was an average affair standard frantic keyboard music like in every horror film without differences. The actors seemed to be brought from some soap opera the way they complained and whined about everything. The idea that the main guy in the film takes this girl to the cabin as their first date makes for a horrible date, but of course, she unrealistically gives herself to him on the first night of getting to know him. There was hardly a budget spent of anything, it seems, but there was a clown outfit and plenty of cheap 1store dolls lying around in the woods, which was a horribly bland place to shoot this whole movie been done too many times. I was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining 4 characters of the film in through the glass maybe, but nothing exciting like that ever entered the film. I guess you were just supposed to like the clown being a killer or something.I had to give the film a 3. It was an interesting premise clown as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre character, essentially and I will give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could have totally been a Bmoviestyle video, but they opted for the more legitimate style of video.

These problems should never really be a deterent from seeing a horror movie but add this amazing weep cast, and you have a real humdinger.The story is about a guy who invites his friends up to his family cabin in Texas for the weekend. He also extends the invitation to his lady crush in his office. On the way there they meet a female in distress, who is then invited to come along by the other girls.The stay at the cabin includes sex and nudity and soon everyones panties are in a bunch when one girl disappears and odd items turn up in the house.From there you the audience and the morons, um, actors, try to figure out what is going on and they soon begin to distrust one another. Overall I think I have made it sound better than it is. The main struggle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped, the plot contrived, the acting bad and the motivations clueless. Once more this could be forgiveable it it was the least bit funny but alas, it is not.The twist ending is only a twist in that no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back through the movie it would not have made sense anyway.

The concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite scary seeing is there are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns....but having it be a 300 pound nursery rhyme reciting killer clown makes a mockery of the genre. I still am wondering how the character Mark was not able to run away from the Clown...he is 300 pounds, he is gotta get tired eventually. The whole ending made me get up and literally say aloud What did I just watch? Apparently Brandon is Denises cousin.... and they had got it on near the middle of the movie meaning he had sex with his cousin.....yeah that is something people want so see shudders.Another thing I found hilariously stupid was the opening scene where the clown stabs a woman and she says What did you do? Well bytch, what do you think he just did? The last thing that was stupidly funny was one second the main character was slapping the hitchhiker and calling her a cnt and then 5 minutes later saying violence is not helping anything....did the writer of the script give the line to the wrong guy? None of this movie makes sense anyway.The movie was more or less a dumb low budget porno which I got sucked into buying all 3.99and got no entertainment out of it besides the sex scenes.

An executive Ken Hebert, who also scripted and coproduced with the director takes skeptical coworker Tracy Amanda Watson and horny married couple Mark and Susan Hank Fields and Chris Buck along on a weekend getaway to a yawn secluded cabin 12 miles from the nearest town. On the way there, they pick up a bitchyslutty hitchhiker Melissa Bale in a bar and end up at their destination where a nightly campfire tale about a murderous clown stalking the very same wooded area comes true when each of the profanityyackin, potsmokin \u0091friends disappears onebyone, with only mutilated doll parts left behind to tell the tale of their fates.The killer clown does not even show up in the film until near the end and it looks nothing like the demonic depiction of it on the video box aside from being morbidly obese. It basically spends an hour prancing around in the woods, chopping up wood and blabbing nursery rhymes. I cannot say enough bad things about the cast, especially the two guys and the hitchhiker chick, who either deliver their insipid dialogue with a bare minimum of enthusiasm or overact at the most inappropriate times. Does not really help that the script is completely and utterly devoid of suspense, originality, intelligence, general coherence or humor. I could go on for days on how inept this film is, how many continuity errors there are and how amateurish the whole production is, but I will just nod off by pointing out the whole package is quite a riot in that BoyThisSucks kind of way.Also noting that the film has been released here in the US as S.I.C.K.

Violent nonsense plods along doggedly, with canned energy and excitement; only Griers flaring temper gives the narrative a jolt she is not much of an actress here, but she connects with the audience in a primal way. Not much different from what Charles Bronson was doing at this time, the film was marketed and advertised as crass exploitation yet still managed to find a sizable innercity audience. Today however, it is merely a footnote in 70s film history, and lacks the widerange appeal of other movies in this genre. 12 from ","label":0},{"index":11762,"txt":"Far from providing the caffeine kick you would expect from a film that shares its name with the most energyboosting of warm beverages, Coffy clunks about and never really rises above being just a ropey revenge tale. Indeed, if the movie was a cup of coffee, it would be rather weak and watery, littered with a few undesirable dregs and lacking in a lingering aftertaste. Sporadically it hits the spot, but otherwise it is not the hot actiondrama it hopes to be.Plotwise, Coffy is a nurse who takes the law into her own hands and delivers hard justice to the drugpushing, ladypimpin, mobsuckers that hooked her younger sister into a depraved, sick state. Sociopolitical commentary on the plight of urban black youths in America is prominent in Coffy, and it makes for some thoughtprovoking stuff as Coffy crusades against the political corruption and white establishment racism that profits and acts as a parasite off the targeted AfroAmerican minorities. Sadly, the timely messages are undermined by the films poor quality and lack of focus. Coffys ideas are important, it is just that they are not wellaimed.One of the plus points of Coffy is the presence of Blaxploitation icon Pam Grier. Grier goes at her role with gusto and makes for an appealing action heroine as she shotguns down the scum in her often spectacular acts of vigilante violence how do you deal with a house full of hoods? Drive the car right through the front door!. It is just a shame that the storyline wavers on occasions, wasting time squeezing as much sexual exploitation as possible. The low budget cannot have helped, but neither does the fact that for a Blaxploitation flick, Coffy lacks groove. Just as the issues are undermined by the lack of quality, consequently the entertainment and excitement are also skewered by moments of dullness and misdirection.The total result is workmanlike and wooden. We get a hip heroine but not a hip movie. It is a shame as Coffy has its moments and should rightly be regarded as a key film in the Blaxploitation craze; it just never ascends above being an average, lukewarm number.","label":0},{"index":11763,"txt":"Pam Grier stars as Coffy. She is a nurse who seeks revenge, on the drug dealers who got her sister hooked on bad heroine. Like any 70s Blaxploitation flick, you can expect to see the racist bad guys get their just desserts. There were scores of these films made during the 70s, and they were really demeaning to both black and white audiences alike. This is mainly due to the vicious racial hostility in these films, and the degrading, stereotypical characters. Especially the female characters. Other common threads between Coffy, and other films of its type, include brutal violence, corrupt cops, car chases, a generous abundance of nudity, and sexcrazed gorgeous women. Not to mention urban ghettos populated by drugdealers, pimps, mobsters, and other criminal scum.Pam Grier, was the undisputed queen of 70s Blaxploitation heroines. She was magnificent, being both toughasnails, and dropdead gorgeous. Like in her other films, Pam outshines the other characters, in Coffy. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on screen, that these sorts of films are unwatchable, without her as the main character. If you like Pam Grier, you are better off seeing her other films, like Foxy Brown, or perhaps Friday Foster. These films have much less empty sleaze, than Coffy does. Pams character in Coffy, degrades herself way too much to get the bad guys. Pams characters in her other Blaxploitation films, do not stoop as low to get revenge, as Coffy did. I would say, only watch Coffy, if you are unable to see any of Pam Griers other films. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Only Pams talent as an actress, makes viewing Coffy bearable.","label":0},{"index":11764,"txt":"I thought they should have called this movie Whites instead of Heights.

The problem Wheezer relays information from different shows and Mary Ann ends up putting soap in the mix! Funny moments occur when the rest of the Gang shows up to pull the taffy  and end up getting it all over the house!The second storyline deals with Stepin Fetchit, a neighborhandyman of the Gang, and his interactions with the Gang.A Tough Winter, to my knowledge, has never been shown on television, although it is available on home video. The reason for this is the Stepin Fetchit characterization which shows a shifty, sly, and slowmoving character. Our Gang producer Hal Roach called Fetchit a skilled comic and used this Our Gang entry as a pilot for a Fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day. Understandably, Fetchit is characterization is offensive to many people today, which explains why the film has been shelved.Although there are some funny moments both with Fetchit and the taffy, A Tough Winter is a plodding and meandering effort. If one positive came out of this film, it was that the Hal Roach Studios grew confident and experienced in making talkies.

There was the endless, boring repetitive narration, slow motion, freeze frame, flashbacks and merged images etc  none of which made a dull film any better.It is called 16 years of alcohol, but there was little drinking or drunkeness and no depiction of withdrawal with the film jumping about all over the place with no coherent sense. The story was badly written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally poor and it is a shame that people have put up further money for more films by Mr Jobson, previously know for being in a rubbish group and on TV making as much sense as this film does.I found it a major struggle to see this to the end but in the hope of it getting better I carried on to the bitter but it really was a waste of time and I would have been better off not bothering.","label":0},{"index":11776,"txt":"Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as great as usual.

Supposedly it was a tribute, as per the appearance of the Clockwork poster on the protagonists wall, however ripoff is the more appropriate word. The movie felt as though it was torn right from the Kubrick classic, only filmed through a new directors eyes. A blind director. Unfortunately when it stops its massacre of Kubricks work, the film gets even worse. As another commentator said, the deepness of this film is just shoved down your throat. Arrogant, self absorbed and ultimately meaningless drivel.Perhaps the protagonists ramblings would touch a nerve if there was any actual character development in this movie. I felt absolutely nothing for this guy. And I am an alcoholic, so I figure that if anyone might be able to feel anything for him, it would be me. Awful character development, dialogue and plot.The worst part about this movie is the title. For a film called 16 Years of Alcohol, the alcoholism is hardly a factor in the flick. See first paragraph  it was such a butchering of A Clockwork Orange I cannot get over it.

Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance. Everyone else is okay.Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night, though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.The funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances  a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes.

And the laughingly bad attempt at giving some sort of poetic edge to a lowerclass man makes things even worse. Resorting to the overused clich\u00e9 of the po\u00e8te maudit reeks of a quick fix, a cheap way to make a dull movie seem smart, artsy and meaningful.But 16 years of alcohol is not much smart, artsy or meaningful... The leading character does not evolve at all, and the feeble attempt of changing fails without a good explanation. Just like the initial attempt happened rather out of the blue.The movie borrows heavily from classics such as A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but it ultimately fails to recapture their greatness, not even for a few seconds.Jobson put too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story, and neglected the rest, giving us a movie which is pleasant to the eye but insipid to the brain.","label":0},{"index":11781,"txt":"There is a key aspect of film that Jobson seems to have forgotten  it has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you.

Have they all been brainwashed?? I have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie.From the first, BU is just a chase film. We pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another. And another. And another. And another. Do you see a pattern emerging? There is virtually no time wasted on plot, character development, or boring old reality.If you have not see the other two Bourne films, you are pretty lost. If you have  you only WISH you were lost  somewhere a long way from a cinema.Paul Greengrasss dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on United 93 which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen, but on Bourne and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character. He runs. He jumps. He punches. He gets blown up. He clears tall buildings. Yada yada yada. Above all  he SURVIVES. He survives like a plastic Action Man survives, which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension. So he drives off a building? So what? He will survive. Yawn.There is a girl thrown into the mix because Bournes love interest died in a previous incarnation, but she is just decor. I have seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of Captain Scarlet.Bournes own journey of literal selfdiscovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we did not know from the first movie. He was turned into a killing machine. Big deal. He finds out his true identity. So what? It does not have any emotional resonance when it comes.The twist ending is telegraphed and weak. Oh, dear, the more I think about this film the more I hate it! I have already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment!

Did not they have any knowledge of modern special effects or CGI?!? Did not they know that in the postmillennium the violence in a supposed horror andor scifimovie should at least be a little bit graphic? Or did I get the purpose wrong, was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal, bound together in the big cycle of life, or a warning to mankind not to mess with Nature, or something like that?? It does not really matter, either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts.First of all the premise is very improbable. If at a given time you are capable of replacing a total eye, no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time, that is totally unprofessional. And to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient?! And why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans, and make the victim look like a freak?! By the way, I noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppylike normal dark eyes, could not they have waited for such a specimen? The story is lame, it is about this poor guy Aaron who gets these weird eyetransplants, which suddenly makes him feel like the donorwolf or at least, that is what I make of it and then he is being chased by some military men. Especially this last bit is ridiculous. I mean, I can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment imagine soldiers with nightvision eyesight! but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient, it is beyond me why they are out to kill him. Why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient? a volunteering soldier maybe??. And why try to kill everyone else that is involved with poor Aaron, is not that a bit steep?! Who the hell are these militaries anyway, I hope not the US army or the government, they behave like psychopaths, walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons, raiding private apartments like they are after some public enemy  1, and displaying during the ultimate showdown in the woods a total lack of discipline, like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren, panicking and shooting randomly around.Aaron, for some unfathomable medical reason, feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes. Why would that be??? He suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves. What is this? Are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donorwolf are situated in it is eyeballs?!? And that the recipient of these eyeballs also adopts the wolfs craving for red life meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land unharmed on his allfours like a cat can a wolf even DO that??!.The acting or the lack thereof did not help the credibility of all this either everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls, especially this Indian girl, she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression vexed and some disinterested mumblings about the force of Nature, and it beats me why Aaron all of a sudden is all over her but hey, there probably had to be at least one lovescene!. I really sympathized with actor Cory Monteith, who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face, but they did not give him much to go with. He has to run around barechested for more than half of the movie, which could have been fun to watch, but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique, Monteith really should leave his shirt on. His few killings and attacks are hardly shown, we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then there is another victim lying down and Aaron with some more blood on his face and chest. Not much for a modern scifi horror! The only good acting came from Justine Bateman, and I really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy fortysomething lady. She did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions, but they made her character a kind of a wimp, who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries. What a pity that the script did not make her stand up a bit more! In the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie, hardly scary or thrilling, with unbelievable goingson, a lot of overlong National Geographiclike visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes who cares?!?, some pretentious Indian ramblings about Man and Nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments.

Aaron escapes the Olaris building  goes on the run but he is too valuable to just let go  a full scale search is mounted to capture him...Directed by Yelena Lanskaya this is yet another SciFi Channel offering that is quite simply put terrible in every possible way, I think it probably started out life as a straight Creature Feature but ended up as one of the most boring  dull SciFi Channel films I have seen that does not even feature any sort of monster or creature. Hybrid is awful, the script is terrible  I am not even sure who it was meant to appeal to. The initial setup is OK with Aaron getting Wolf eyes but then Hybrid ditches the scifi elements  becomes some sort of horrible drama as it focuses entirely on Aarons mental state as he wonders around doing nothing in particular with some Native American woman. Yep, you do not think the SciFi Channel could make a film about Wolves  put loads of rubbish about Native American mythology in there as well do you? The dynamics of the characters is bizarre, Aaron is shown as the persecuted hero yet he is the only character to kill anyone in the film  is a fairly unlikable, ungrateful  annoying person while Dr. Hewitt is shown as the evil scientist yet she gives Aaron back his sight  does nothing but try to help him. I mean Aaron is given back the gift of sight yet Hewitt is the villain? Also the regular SciFi Channel staple of US military intervention is present, the problem is why do they want Aaron so badly? He is not a soldier  while he has Wolves eyes to help him see in the dark he is utterly unremarkable. The script cannot make it is mind up whether it is all in Aarons mind or it is real, the ending is hilariously bad with a half naked rememeber this was made for telly Aaron running through a forest with a pack of Wolves set to some horrible music that I think is supposed to be emotional but makes it even more funny. There are so many things wrong with Hybrid, it is slower than hell, there is virtually no action, there is no Werewolves  the film goes round in circles trying to get into Aarons mind yet it is all so ridiculous, silly  boring you will not care one bit  there is never any explanation as to why despite just having Wolves eyes transplanted Aaron starts to develop other Wolf senses.As a diabetic I have problems with my eyes, hell I have had major surgery on my right eye  I can guarantee you that after an operation your eye would be puffed up, you would not be able to open it  it would hurt like hell yet despite having eye transplants as soon as Aaron wakes up in bed his eyes are perfect with no swelling or even redness. There are no special effects, no blood or gore or violence  nothing to excite you. In fact now I think about it there is nothing even remotely horror or scifi feeling about this, it feels like a drab film of the week.Filmed in Manitoba in Canada the film looks OK but is bland  forgettable. The acting is poor from all involved none of whom I have seen before  hopefully never again.Hybrid is a terrible film that is obviously marketed as some Werewolve Creature Feature but is far from that  most people will really struggle to get to the awful ending which will probably have you in stitches.","label":0},{"index":11794,"txt":"I hired out Hybrid on the weekend.

Which is just as well, since the end result was not anything particularly special if decently atmospheric at that for starters, the plot is pretty weak \u0096 even though in a way it anticipates the Vincent Price vehicle THEATRE OF BLOOD 1973\u0085albeit without any of that films campy gusto. What we have here, in fact, is a penniless sculptor Martin Kosleck \u0096 whom we even see sharing his measly plate of cheese with his pet cat! \u0096 who, upon finding himself on the receiving end of art critic Alan Napiers vitriolic pen one time too many, decides to end it all by hurling himself into the nearby river. However, while contemplating just that action, he is anticipated by Rondo Hattons escaped killer dubbed The Creeper and, naturally enough, saves the poor guys life with the intention of having the latter do all the dirty work for him in gratitude! Although it is supposedly set in the art circles of New York, all we really see at work is Kosleck and commercial painter Robert Lowery who keeps painting the same statuesque blonde girl Joan Shawlee over and over in banal poses \u0096 how is that for art? who, conveniently enough, is engaged to a rival art critic Virginia Grey of Napiers! Before long, the latter is discovered with his spine broken and Lowery is suspected; but then investigating detective Bill Goodwin gets the bright idea of engaging another critic to publish a scathing review of Lowerys work I did not know that publicity sketches got reviewed!! so as to gauge how violent his reaction is going to be! In the meantime, Kosleck deludes himself into thinking that he is creating his masterpiece by sculpting Hattons uniquely craggy \u0096 and recognizable \u0096 visage which, needless to say, attracts the attention of the constantly visiting Grey we are led to believe that she lacks material for her weekly column\u0085much to the chagrin of both artist and model. Bafflingly, although The Creeper is fully aware of how Grey looks thanks to her aforementioned haunting of Koslecks fleabitten pad, he bumps off Shawlee \u0096 who had by then become Goodwins girl! \u0096 in Lowerys apartment and, overhearing Kosleck talking to you guessed it Grey about his intention to dump him as the fall guy for the police, sends the slowwitted giant off his deep end\u0085even down to destroying his own nowcompleted stony image.

The most interesting part of this film is its stunt casting of Rondo Hatton, a man with a bone disease as the films monster. Its sad to see this man exploited, but he probably made good use of the money they paid him. Hatton is less horrifying than the studio hoped, as I more often felt pity over fear or even loathing. Martin Koslack is on board as the films mad artist, and he is very amusing in this part. I for one enjoy seeing Koslack in just about anything; for some reason the man amuses me. The only other part of the film that entertained me is the films absurd take on the art world. Here we are shown evil art critics who revel in their ability to break artists; this is side by side with the films male hero who is an artist who paints...get this...pin up girls. Somehow our heros work is reviewed side by side with the villans absurdist sculpture. Also amusing is the films chief nasty critic, who at one point claims that he despises the heros pin up art because women like that do not exist to which our heroine replies with an assurance that the critic just does not get out enough. Finally, there is a bit of a subplot about the heroines who is an art critic herself domestication by the leading man....completely antifeminist and ridiculous to witness. Overall this film is a rather mediocre picture with a few amusing elements.","label":0},{"index":11802,"txt":"The peculiar charisma of Martin Kosleck brings a certain believability to his character of the frustrated artist. He imbues his dialog with an odd sense of realism, making the sculptor Marcel a convincing individual. The character manages to come across as a real person and not so much a typical B movie villain.The story line is nothing to write home about, and many scenes are dull. What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as the Creeper. Koslecks talkative, philosophical character is contrasted with Hattons low key, monosyllabic approach. The character of the Creeper is not developed much beyond a basic monster level, but Hatton suggests undeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about his back story.This movie was on Shock Theater a lot when I was a kid, so I have a certain nostalgic fondness for it.

I first saw Mr. Oates back in the 1960s television series called Stoney Burke. From then on, I followed his career closely and felt he was destined for great roles. That happened in 1974, when Sam Peckinpah gave him top billing in a film called Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia. Of course, his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in The Wild Bunch. I have always thought he was quite able to bring any character a certain magic, that is until I saw him in this flop. The movie is called  Chandler , a tribute to the iron fisted detectives of the 1950s created by Raymond Chandler. Because, the synopsis said it was about a hard nose Private Eye, I was immediately interested.

The mystery implicated is so obscure and so little revealed throughout the film that the viewer is left perplexed from scene to scene. The movie seems torn between being a detective mystery and an espionage thriller, but never settles upon one or the other. The sense of suspense is entirely absent. The main characters settle on playing dry, emotionless types in a fashion that inspires no empathy whatsoever. The cinematography is pedestrian. The result is that the hapless viewer loses interest in the characters, the plot, and, in the end, the film itself.

Since everyone does this, the viewer finds it immersive after awhile, and even to my modern sensibilities, it does not bother much. What really irritates me is the writing and the plotting. I am not talking about the sunny weather on the moon, or baking soda powered rocket ships, or a flying suit that has controls labeled updown and fastslow. I am not even bothered by the cheesiness of the resolutions to the cliffhangers that end each chapter. I am talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are dumber than fence posts and have no cumulative memory. And by the fact that although that the dialog clips along like an express train, the plot goes through the same motions again and again. Dig it Commando Cody and his pal are the spearhead of a top secret hi tech science lab charged with protecting Earth or at least the USA against an insidious alien invasion. But his office has no guards or security checkpoints. They do not even have locks on the front doors. So the bad guys walk RIGHT IN and beat the crap out of the Cody and his staff ...not once perhaps understandable but SEVERAL times. They even kidnap his female assistant on the second try. And they never get any smarter. To further prove my point, allow me to point out the way that Cody jumps in his flying suit and flies around getting into trouble and never actually seems to succeed in catching anyone. He does this over and over and over. Cody also flies his ship to the Moon the woman assistant comes along to cook, stays for about 30 seconds and immediately turns around and comes back. Cody captures one of the Atomic Ray guns...and immediately loses it again to the bad guys because he could not be bothered to lock it up. And so on.And you would think that if Codys efforts were so vital to saving the USA from the Moon Men, that he might ask for a few soldiers with carbines, a few helicopters and a tank or two to back him up, instead of just working with the local police all the time. This was supposed to be a military operation, but they act like it is another episode of Gangbusters. It is all rather hard to stomach. I appreciate that the creators were severely limited in the scope of their story by budget and time constraints...and I appreciate that Cody is actually a reasonably tough hombre even though he loses half of his fistfights. But I just cannot help yelling DOOR! LOCK THE DOOOOR!! when the gangsters simply walk into his lab, or try to blow up the ship and there are NO security measures at the landing site in place...not even a fence !. Still, it is OK. Of the three Republic serials I have watched, Phantom Creeps had a better plot, and Undersea Kingdom had more atmosphere hah! and a better hero than Radar Men, but it is an OK timewaster. BTW...why Radar men? They did not use radar, they used Atomic Ray Guns. Should not the title have been Atomic Ray Gun Men From The Moon?","label":0},{"index":11829,"txt":"...at least during its first half. If it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes, it would have been a much better and tighter film. The second half of the film is worth it, especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships, but it is like a dull toothache getting there. Also, do not watch this film just because Ginger Rogers is in it. She has an important role, but it is a small one.The film starts out showing three New York City buddies working the tourist trade and also in goodnatured competition for the hand of Sally Ginger Rogers, a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue. World War I breaks out, the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle, yet enlist in the navy anyways. The one of the three with the least industry as a civilian Bill Boyd as Baltimore winds up the commanding officer to the other two Robert Armstrong as Dutch and James Gleason as Skeets. To make matters more complex, Sally has fallen in love with one of the three, but does not have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to war.The film is a little more interesting on board ship, mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself, and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable. However, James Gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby, especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible.One real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design, or, I should say, the lack of it. In the scenes in New York just prior to WWI we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931  no effort was taken to bring this film into period.In conclusion, if you watch the few scenes with Ginger Rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission, you have seen everything here worth seeing. The rest is padding.","label":0},{"index":11830,"txt":"The threesome of Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong, and James Gleason play Coney Island carnys vying for the hand of Ginger Rogers, a working gal who sells salt water taffy.

The second half concentrates on action sequences as the US Navy pursues both a German merchant cruiser and a Uboat. These sequences are lively and wellfilmed, but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedydrama with a flat ending.

I would rather of just seen the exstars do commentary. The batmobile side story was stupid.As for the flashback movie, I think it was too short and left out way too much. It was really just a quick overview in my opinion. I would like more background. They showed the Penguin and Joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff I already knew. The Joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an exsmoker. That was it on those 2.I would love to read the book.

It is absolutely spoton, and therefore the only aspect of the film for which I can give 10 out of 10. There are houseboats, there is horror, there is even horror that takes place on houseboats. But if there were ever a tagline for the film poster, it would surely be Something shonky this way comes... for Houseboat Horror is easily the worst Australian horror film I have ever seen, not to mention one of the worst horror films I have ever seen, and a fairly atrocious attempt at filmmaking in general. The good news is, it is so bloody awful, it sails straight through the zone of viewer contempt into the wonderful world of unintentional hilarity. It is worth watching because it is bloody awful.The category of worst comes not from the storyline, for the simple reason that there actually is one a record producer, a film crew and a rock band drive up to the mystifyinglynamed Lake Infinity, a picturesque rural retreat somewhere in Victoria in reality Lake Eildon to shoot a music video. Someone is not especially happy to see them there and, possibly in an attempt to do the audience a favour, starts picking them off one by one with a very sharp knife. Even more mystifying is how long it takes the survivors to actually notice this, On the surface, it looks like a very bogstandard Bmovie slasher. You have got highlyannoying youths, intolerant elders, creepy locals one of whom, a petrol station attendant, would easily win a gurning competition, and let us face it, my description of the murderer could easily be Jason Voorhees. Ah, but if only the acting and production values were anywhere near as good as the comparative masterpiece that was Friday The 13th Part VII. Unfortunately, Houseboat Horror is completely devoid of both these things.But in the end, this only makes what you do get so ridiculous and amusing. Fans of onetime Late Show and Get This member Tony Martin will already be aware of some of the real dialogue gems Check out the view...you will bar up!, while the actual song to accompany the music video is so bad it has to be heard to be believed  I cannot help wondering if writerdirector Ollie Wood hoped it would actually become a hit. The horror element is comparable I think to Bslashers of the genre and particularly of the period, but there were times when I could not help imagining someone biting into a hamburger offscreen and seeing a volley of tomato sauce sprayed at the wall onscreen.Indeed, if you have been listening to Tony Martin recommending this film as hilarious rubbish like myself, I do not think you will be disappointed. Any fans of sobadit isgood horror should not pass up the opportunity. Whether you will bar up or not though is another matter.

I will not get into the psychedelic version which is terrible  give me traditional villains please.The acting in the new stuff is lousy, read off a sheet with either no feeling or overacting. Paul Soles, where are you now? This guy was the best at voice acting for Spiderman. No one comes close. Watching Secret Wars, a great idea for a cartoon miniseries, made me wince. Dr. Doom sounds like a comedy version of Bela Lugosi. In a scene with Red Skull and Doc Ock, Red Skull has no German accent while Ock is heavy Russian! The old Marvel comic hero series from 1966 had much better voice acting. Iron Man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask, Captain America sounded authoritative not like some teenage kid. Paul Frees as the Thing in the 60s was the best Thing ever. The old voice actors were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them. Ever hear Mel Blancs son? No way can he replicate his dad.The animation is clunky. Okay, so they have all the fancy character shadings and nicely painted backrounds. Sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad. Sometimes when you let the computer take over the movements they become robotic. I really do not think any of these animators know what in betweeners are. The stories are badly written, and some of the lines they give the heroes are horrible. Why, for example, when heroes are teamed together for the first time they start fighting with each other? In Secret Wars, it was a lame excuse that got them in disagreement. I can see if the hero was dark, unknown and mysterious  like the Punisher, but why the Thing and Iron Man cannot hold their tempers with each other is ridiculous, then the Torch joins in. This is just another of the later comic trends to get heroes to square off at each other for a few seconds because everyone wants to see that stuff. Give them a better reason to fight and maybe it can be pulled off, but Hey what are you doing here and You do not tell me what to do are LAME reasons. Another badly written scene is in The Wedding where Harry Osborne unmasks himself to spoil Peters wedding. That whole scenario was awful.Last, but certainly not least, is what another critic calls Juvenile Violence  meaning no punches at all. In Secret Wars, the Lizard carefully ducked the Things charge. But the Thing punches the bad guys across an entire block in the comics. He must simply revert to lifting heavy things and subduing a bad guy by grabbing hold of him in the cartoons. Sure, these cartoons were not made strictly for us adults but for kids under 12. That is why they cannot have punching, because mommy and daddy do not believe in that type of violence. But you can blow things up, these cartoons will include that. As a kid before political correctness came in fashion I saw cartoons punching each other. What is wrong with a punch to the chops? Is there really less violence in the world today because those slick and crafty new cartoons took out the punch? I find this the most insulting of all when I watch the new stuff.

The actors in this film, though, had only one facial expression each. If the close camera was not enough, the lack of light in the film killed it. The film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark.

There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous. It is not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute. One of the best World War II films, Twelve Of the clock High, has very little action. But it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension. The exception to The Story of G.I.

But alas, the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this highlight. Another turnoff is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who is meant to be a romeo but comes off a pervert.

Then the cops realize that the killer is in the house, and call Jess and tell her do not ask questions, just do as I say\u0085 walk to the front door and get out. So what does moron Jess do? Starts screaming Phil? Barb? Phil? Barb? Hey, great idea sister. Now why do not you go right upstairs where you know a psychotic killer is lurking? Of course she does, and sees her former friends, all splashed with ketchup, prompting this viewer to scream at the screen Have a clue now?!Now, obviously one needs to be understanding and realize that this movie was made before the classic slasher movie tropes were solidly in place, and that it does not move to the same pace we are used to, and seeing a plasticcovered corpse in the attic like 206 times probably WAS scary back in the day, and people were not used to being stalked by psychopaths, so they would not think to, you know, lock the doors or windows. And they might be tempted to wander upstairs when they have just been told that a rabid killer is up there. You see, people were stupid back in the 70s. We have to understand that. One of the big shocks is that we do not even see our protoFinal Girl kill the psycho. But believe me, that fact is more interesting being read in this review than sitting through the movie for.

It starts off with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire. the ending may be funny but it is also so blunt that I almost felt it insulted my intelligence what little there is.

This version remains pretty faithful to Dahls original story so one cannot lay the blame on John Hambleys script. If anything the fault lies with the colourless animation, the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voiceovers. One would be right to expect this story to make for a happy, vibrant, funfilled movie..... instead, the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch. Children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first! All the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a childrens classic.Young orphan Sophie voice of Amanda Root lives in a nonetoofriendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of Mrs Clonkers. One evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street. The figure realises it has been seen, so it reaches in through the window and scoops Sophie from her bed, placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night. Sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from Giant Country, and fears that he will eat her. But to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the BFG voice of David Jason. The BFG refuses to eat people, instead restricting himself to foultasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers. However, Giant Country is populated by numerous other giants who DO feast  every night, as it happens  on poor unsuspecting humans. Sophie and the BFG become great friends, and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants. Together they go to the Queen of England voice of Angela Thorne with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the maneating giants. The Queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else.Jason voices the BFG quite well one of the few pluses in the film but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality. The rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired, with very little to bring the characters to life. Similarly, the BFG is the only character that is imaginatively animated  Sophie lacks appeal, and the giants are boringly designed and look almost indistinguishable from each other. Even the places are uninventive; Giant Country especially comes up short, being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons. At 88 minutes the film is not exactly lengthy, yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences. Little of Dahls mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily. One chapter in the book deals with the BFGs love of whizzpopping farting and is laughoutloud hilarious. In the film, the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling. I came to the The BFG expecting lots of zest, fun and enjoyment, but what I got was pretty much the opposite! This one is a failed misfire that simply does not match the calibre of the book in any department  unfortunately, therefore, it must go down as one to skip.","label":0},{"index":11859,"txt":"This was not enjoyable to watch.

They provide a horribly tacky cheap entertainment. This movie entertained for the first half hour, because it was so bad it could be made fun of in an MST3K style manner quite easily. Then it got boring.The acting is the scariest part of the movie. While great acting is not to be expected, this was laughably bad and, honestly, provided all of the entertainment that was to be had. This is the plus side to the movie. Where the movie really falters in entertaining is the writing, lighting, and the editing.This movie provides way too many What the  is going on? moments. There are many moments, such as the mother having strange fits at dinner, and then that having absolutely no consequence in the movie. Along the lines of dinner, someone in charge decided it was fun to watch people eat refined food for five minutes straight without dialogue every time a meal was served. During the meals and other inappropriate moments, the scene cuts away to pure darkness outside. Then cuts back in. And speaking of darkness outside, one of the funniest parts of the movie is the climate, where apparently it is not nighttime unless it is raining. And speaking of darkness, a big problem with the movie is that it is so poorly lit you cannot see what is going on half the time, which is more of a frustration than anything. In one of the climactic scenes, you cannot even tell what you are supposed to be seeing that is so shocking.And when it comes to climactic scenes, Unhinged contains one of the worst. I have seen people say Wow, that surprised me, and that is good. I can say that the big reveal did surprise me, because I did not see it coming. The reason I did not see it coming is because it made absolutely no sense. I will not ruin it for you, but I will tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes rewinding to various parts of the movie to find anything that would have validated that at all, and all we found were more things saying that it was not possible.All in all, this movie is actually better when you watch it with the commentary tracks that make fun of it.

It is hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique. It is plot is fairly overdonethree young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter. Very quickly, the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic. On top of that, the mother and daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship, as they quarrel intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner. The old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking guys in at night to sleep with them. Halfway through the film, when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help, the killing begins. As far as the acting goes, this film is at the bottom of the barrel. NONE of the three stranded girls can act, particularly the lead girl. It is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same, wooden tone throughout the film. The mother and daughter are better, but not much. The film is also quite dull in parts and really, really drags. The killings are gruesome, but nothing we have not seen before. However, as mentioned on here, the film really gains points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending. It comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic Sleepaway Camp. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring, boring pacing. The isolated, creepy looking mansion and the dark, foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism, but that is quickly shattered when one of the characters attempts to act.

A group of college girls driving to a rock concert by way of the deep, dark woods in one of the longest driving sequences ever captured on celluloid slide off the road. No visible damage is done to the car but apparently it was enough to put one of the characters in a comatose state for the rest of the film or perhaps she read the script and was already in a coma before filming began.The two remaining girls wake up in a big, isolated house. The house, by the way, is fabulous and manages more drama just by its presence than any of the actors in the film. For some reason, though, this house has no roads going to it. The only way you can get to the main road is by hiking five miles through the woods. The girls spend the rest of Unhinged sitting around listening to weird conversations between an old rich bitch who looks like George Washington in drag and her equally homely, sexually repressed daughter. The girls apparently were in no hurry to get back from that concert anyway being that they packed more clothes than the cast of Gilligans Island for that three hour tour.By the time we, the viewers, get to the kill scenes, we no longer care. We wish that someone would kill us just to end our suffering . Unhinged finally wraps up with a quite shocking ending that deserved to be in a much better film. It is almost as though the ending, the one good idea in the film, was written first and then the writers tried to make a movie leading up to it.Unhinged is ultimately a boring film with bad acting, inept directing, and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porno film sorry.

Watching Unhinged was like seeing an amateur acting class go through it is warmup. Some of the most awkward, badly lit, overlong scenes are played out with the gusto of a Valium overdose.

Strange goings on happen as these girls stay at this house for several days instead of trying to leave or get home, and the suspense progresses into a dumb slasher.This film is too caught up in it is dialogue, and it is always between only a few characters. We have the main three girls, the creepy spinster and the old lady, and conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five. To make matters worse, they never have anything interesting to say. It is actually quite maddening sitting through their conversations. We want to know what is going on, and instead they just talk and talk and talk about nothing.Plot holes are abundant here. The house these girls stay at when they get in their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere...wow, three miles! A two hour or less walk will kill them. Why did not they get a ride with the worker for this household who was driving into town? Did he have a one seater? How come these girls never question leaving and just willingly stay, rarely even checking up on each other? Why did this have to have so many dumb twists?

Talking about why the girls are here, and how they must be to dinner on time because mother does not like it when someone is late. And more talking. Yakkity yak. Some suspense is built as a crazy guy is walking around and harassing the girls, and someones eyeball is looking through holes in the walls at the pretty girls in something that looks like Hitchcocks Psycho. I digress because there is so much blah blah in this film, that you wonder when the killings are going to start. In fact, one of the girls gets so bored out of her mind that she walks in the woods, alone, looking for the town. Smart move. She probably knew about the lonely virgin walking alone in the woods part, but just did not care. More talk continues after this as we wait, wait, and wait some more until the next girl may or may not be killed.And then there is the twist ending. The expected unexpected for some viewers, for others a real gotcha. Quite possibly the ONLY reason why someone would really want to watch this. I do not care how twisted it is, nothing in this movie makes up for the most boring time I had watching it. Even with the minor impact of the ending, the director just did not have what it takes to really deliver a good story with it. It would have made a much better 30 minute  1 hour TV episode on say, Tales from the Darkside.If you really must get this for any reason, perhaps just to say you have watched every slasher movie, do yourself a favor and have the fastforward button ready. Since the movie has so many unimportant scenes, just zoom through them, and in no time, you will get to the WOW, that is what it was all this time ending. Oh and halfway through the movie there is a shower scene with 2 girls showing boobees. Horray for boobees. Those beautiful buzzing honeymaking boobees.","label":0},{"index":11878,"txt":"this movie was banned in england? why? tom savini, george romero, dario argento, lucio fulci and others had done far worse before and have continued to so since...this movie has all the basic elements of a decent 70s or early 80s horror film. good looking girls who cannot act to save their lives, by the way, a terrible lightning storm with a torrential downpour, a scythe, a crazy brother wandering around the family estate, and actually a pretty damn good twist at the end. but banned? seriously. when the English parliament banned this movie, the italians probably laughed their collective asses off at how backwards and prudish the brits really were.there was maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to the violence and gore which was greatly underdone. there was nudity but no sex although allusions to sex were made, obviously. but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned.i would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with. as it stands, the film is entertaining, but the lack of picture and sound quality take away from the end result.banned... what a joke...","label":0},{"index":11879,"txt":"I tried to like this slasher, like I try to enjoy all slasher films. I mean mindless slaying mixed with a little nudity and some suspense, how can you go wrong. But Unhinged I think is an example of that formula going wrong. The main issue is the horrible acting of the main three girls that landed up in the house. It was as if they were under sedation, and it stopped me from ever getting interested in their plight. The film aims for suspense and creepiness but the by the numbers direction saps it of those, and leaves the movie pretty dull. It is a shame, because if the movie was better executed, it would have have been ace. The story and characters are pretty creepy and there are some dark and bizarrely humorous moments of interaction between the mother, the girls, and the daughter in the old house. There is some good nudity, and occasional splashy bloodletting, just not enough to give the film the kick it needed. The finale is pretty twisted and fearsome, and does give the film a big lift but sadly, its too little too late. So, in my opinion, one to avoid, unless you really love obscure slasher films. There is a fair amount of potential, but the film delivers too little to be worthwhile.","label":0},{"index":11880,"txt":"If one sits down to watch Unhinged, it is probably because its advertisements, video boxes, whatever, scream that it was banned in the UK for over 20 years as virtually every video nasty does. It is true; exploitation and taboo excites people and draws them in with their promise of controversy. Being an exploitation fan, however, none of this was new to me. The advertisements that scream that the film was banned in the UK do not necessarily make me want to watch it; in fact, the first thing that usually pops into my head is how disgustingly paranoid British censors are. How I came to viewing this then is simple it promised gore and it was only 6.99. The price alone alerted me not to have any hopes of this being the next Halloween, but a cheap padding of your DVD collection never hurts. I did force myself, however, to watch it all in one sitting, because I find that deciding to save the rest for another day makes you even less inspired to finish it. So anyway, after 90 minutes of Unhinged, I found that I had come across the cheapest sleeping aid in existence. I think the distributors could make a fortune if they simply changed their marketing technique.The layout of Unhinged is of any common slasher from the 80s. There is unnecessary shower scenes and exploitative gore. That is about it. Anyway, it starts with a group of three attractive coeds crashing their car on the way to a concert. Though two of them Terry and Nancy are okay, one Gloria is severely injured and is out of commission for the rest of the movie. They are rescued and receive shelter at a mansion that happens to have no phone, of course with rather strange occupants Marion is a middleaged woman with a manhating mother who constantly accuses Marion of sneaking men into the house in order to sleep with them echoes of Psycho?. She also happens to have a crazy brother Carl who lives in the woods, because her mothers hatred for men is so intense that she refuses to let him stay in the house. After hanging with Marion for awhile, Terry our hero and Nancy decide they must contact their parents. Despite everyones warnings, Nancy braves the dangerous woods to make it to a phone her fate is not hard to predict. After that, we see Gloria again, who is then promptly butchered with an ax. When Terry discovers that Gloria has disappeared from her room, she decides something is not right with this picture and sets out to find her missing friends. That may be easier said than done, however, with crazy Carl lurking around\u0085 After viewing Unhinged, I read an overwhelming number of reviews declaring that Unhinged worked perfectly because it took its time to build its subject matter that created real tension by the time the moment of truth comes at the end. Normally, I do not drag other peoples opinions into my reviews especially when they contradict my views, but in this case, I was so puzzled by their reactions that I thought it would be relevant to mention. This is because in actuality, the film crawls. Normally for the slowbuilding tactic to work, the audience must have a strong sense that the characters are in danger. Oh sure, we see two of them get murdered, but between that are endless scenes of conversation and boredom. We are aware that there is a killer on the loose, but this is only focused on three times in the film; that means there is no reason to fear for the victims. Instead, the films events are explained not by the actions of the characters, but are drawn out for us by perpetual talking. If there is one thing I can assure you from watching this, it is that scenes of characters merely conversing with each other for 75 minutes are very tedious. None of this is helped by the atrocious acting. It seems that this was another case of the director needing actors and decided to gather his friends around instead of finding anyone with experience.Of course, I would be a liar if I said there was not one part of the movie that I enjoyed. Specifically, the ending was one of the best I have ever seen in a slasher film; you just do not expect that to happen. Just knowing that the director had the balls to do something like that is spectacular. Ah, I will not spoil it for you, nor will I say that the ending completely makes up for the rest of the slowmoving film, but it definitely will get your attention. Other than that, the other two murder scenes bring at least some faster paced material, but it is not like you could not tell exactly who was going to die fifteen minutes into the film. Anyone looking for a bloodbath will be disappointed, however; those are the only scenes of gore present. That and, of course, no one scene can save an entire movie. I normally preach the doctrine that as long as there is action, the worse a movie is, the better it gets. Unhinged only grasps one part of this concept. The whole film just feels Lukewarm; there is potential alright, but the director either was not experienced enough to make it work or just did not know what the hell he was doing.","label":0},{"index":11881,"txt":"There is only one thing I am going to say about cat in the hat...as a KIDS movie and a good comedy movie it sucks...I lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but were not exactly kid appropriate.

The acting was bad, the plot was tweaked too much, and the humor was surprisingly very crude.It starts with Conrad and Sally, A rule breaker and a future sheriff. When their Mother has to go to work, she gets Mrs. Kwan to babysit. Possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when Mrs. Kwan is watching a Taiwanese court room, a la CSPAN. She soon falls asleep, and here comes the Cat.The film starts to spiral out of control. The Cat came to try to let the kids have some fun. He is got Thing 1 and Thing 2, Who suddenly start trashing the house. He improvises a TV Infomercial, and accidentally slices his tail off. And when the Cat goes full Carmen Miranda, it is not funny. Possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist. And there is a fish who tries warning the kids about the Cat.Too bad he did not warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk, or chopping your tail off.Soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog, who has the key to a crate on his collar. If the crate is not locked soon, their house will be home to the Cats universe. Here it gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the film.The acting, overall, is horrible. Mike Meyers brings his brand of irreverent Austin Powers humor to the Cat, Saying things like You dirty ho and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata. Spencer Breslin is great as the troublemaking Conrad, and Dakota Fanning is cute as Sally, though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous Aortic Dissection waiting to kill John Ritteraccident waiting to happen.

He does nothing with the invisibility angle, just a few doors opening on their own is as adventurous as it gets.

It adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the childrens mother for her money. If that was a subplot, then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and the cat plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is. Take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie.","label":0},{"index":11904,"txt":"From the acting, direction, scriptwriting and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims.

It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on. But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt. However, my decision to see The Cat in the Hat was not made haphazardly. You see, three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the calamity known as How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful, funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat. So when the critics unleashed their fury against The Cat in the Hat, another big budget Seuss update with a big name star in the title role, I thought that it must be the same old song. How wrong I was.For five whole minutes I thought I was in the clear. The opening credits are clever, the kids are charming and the production values are top notch. Then the cat showed up. There are many problems from this point on, but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of Mike Myers. Where The Grinch was saved by the inspired casting of Jim Carrey, The Cat was destroyed by Myers. He can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong, comic sketches. Every movie he is made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch, from Waynes World to Austin Powers. So he tries to do the same thing here, it is just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of SNL, not funny, just painful. Not that the writers helped him out any. After the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags, poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor. This movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience I have ever had. Period. So much talent and work went into something so vile. I know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess, I just hope that the wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies.

Now there are two types of terrible, there is Freddy vs. Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is a movie like this.

As I watched the first bit of it not only was I bored senseless, but I felt as though I had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love the majority of his work, but something in this movie did not click.

Cat was... well, just awful.Jim Carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly commits to over the top, outrageous characters. Mike Myers fell back on his old bag of tricks.Why, why, why Mike Myers?? The kids could care less, and the Austin Powers demographic is not going to spy this film. So, what was the studio thinking?The Cat was also apparently related to Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why a New York Accent? Not entirely consistent with anything Dr. Seuss has ever written. Myers was even allowed to sneak in his Scottish shtick. I wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said as long as you do not say fahklempt, you can keep the accents. Meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort, either with the costume, makeup, or dialogue.The jokes, what few there were, were crude and age inappropriate. When Myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers to the camera dirty ho, everything but the rim shot was missing, and even that would not have helped.The same folks who created Whoville, clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in Cat. The sets and props were very appealing, giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing, direction, and Myers.There was some fun to be had with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a Dr. Seuss classic, and stayed true to the genre.Call the SPCA.

Unfortunately the digital film qualitys quite grainy in places, and it is most noticeable in the welllit white halls of the asylum. Ridiculous lighting design plagues parts of this film, to say nothing of the variations in the passage of time. I understand the director might have been trying to simulate dementia, but in order for this to be effective consistent time flow needed to be established. Asis, it merely seems amateurish. Plot twists were numerous but consistently predictable. I neither had a doubt in my mind of the identity of the robed cultists, nor of the fact that some kind of lame eviltrumpsgood development would surface at the end. This may seem like quibbling, but characters in this film reliably fail to employ any kind of common sense. First of all, regulatory commissions would be all over a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patient and employee deaths cardiac arrestinduced. Why would the head psychiatrist also be capable of performing autopsies? Why was not a plot point made of these impressive qualifications, or of his introduction to his odd choice of religion? What is the background? What is supposed to make us care about anyone in this? And just as importantly, who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place, see everything that was so frighteningly wrong with it, and then conclude that it was still a fine place to pursue a residency?

The script by Matt McCombs takes itself pretty seriously  I quite liked the basic idea behind  some of it is ideas but there are a few things which work against it. For a start the film is just too slow, the story is pretty good  does not give itself away too early but it takes an absolute age for it to get going  I was rapidly losing interest with each passing minute. I also thought the socalled twist ending was far too predictable  the ending itself far too bland  forgettable. It is a shame because I liked the story, the characters, the setting  some of the ideas but it is simply too slow  frankly dull to keep one entertained over it is 90 minute duration. It is one of those films which I would like to recommend but in all honesty I cannot.Director Jones does a good job, this is actually a well lit  quite atmospheric film. I would not say there is anything scary here. I am not sure if Hellborn was shot in a real insane asylum but if it was not they did a great job on the sets  the film looks pretty good overall. Unfortunately there is a real lack of gore or action, there are two handprint shaped wounds  a severed tongue  that is it, absolutely nothing else in terms of blood or gore which has to go down as a disappointment.

The movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients. Turns out that there is a demon on the basement that is harvesting peoples souls. It is the job of the 1 doctor, 1 nurse, and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs, do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out, and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects.

While this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of filmmaking; most movies, specially genre films, must not only tell it is story or message, they must entertain their target audience in some way. All this just to say that in my opinion a bad movie is not a movie with low production values or lowbudget, a bad movie is one that is boring.Hellborn or Asylum of the Damned as is known in the U.S., is a bad movie simply because it is just not involving, and irremediably boring and tiresome. While it has a very good premise, it is just poorly developed and the mediocre acting does not make things better. On another hands the film probably could had been a fine or even classic Bmovie, but here it is just a bad attempt at filmmaking.Director Philip J. Jones tells the tale of James Bishop Matt Stasi, a young psychiatry resident, who just got his dream job at St. Andrew Mental Hospital; but the old asylum seems to hide a secret. After the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumors of satanic practices, James decides to find out what is going on; only to find the incredulity of his boss, Dr. McCort Bruce Payne, who believes that Bishop is going as insane as his patients.While the premise is quite interesting, the execution of the film leaves a lot to be desired. In an attempt of making a supernatural psychological thriller, Jones goes for the easy way out and makes a movie filled with every clich\u00e9 of the genre. Of course, there are lots of great movies that are also filled with clich\u00e9s; but in Hellborn every single one is wasted and turned into a cheap jump scare to keep things moving, resulting in a boring and predictable storyline.The acting is quite mediocre for the most part, with one big exception Bruce Payne gives a topnotch performance that makes the movie look unworthy of such good acting. Matt Stasi is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performances.Despite all this flaws, one thing has to be written about Hellborn; it has a visual look very good for the budget and very similar to modern day bigbudget Hollywod horror productions. Also, the makeup and prosthetics are done very nicely and the designs for the main antagonist are quite good. Sadly, the rest of the Special Effects are awful and outdated, making a huge contrast with the makeup  prosthetics.Hellborn is a movie with a few good things outnumbered by its serious flaws with terrible results.

B\u00e9art also undresses a couple of times, but even fullyclothed her presence is enough to make this film eminently watchable. Watch out for the scene where she tells her friend about the three first times for a girl. It is corny, but still far more erotic than the rather laughably choreographed love scenes featuring Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. Incidentally, the cinematography is not great; the stills for the closing credits are a better indication of what David Hamilton is capable of.","label":0},{"index":11935,"txt":"This ludicrous film offers the standard 1970s hippie mentality in a nut shell and bores us in the process. Its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups. A naive young hippy played by the waiflike  Kay Lenz  hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day she meets the ridiculous Holden, already in old age, hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor, and she decides that she is in love with him. If you think that is superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes. She keeps saying how much she loves him and she only met him, it wears thin and really quick. I could not help but laugh throughout the film. Its obvious she is just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place. A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex, I had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit. A corny offering of music from the 70s is also spread through the film.

When Lisa  the Devil was shown at film festivals in the early 70s, it was a critical success. Audiences responded well to that gorgeous, Gothic horror film. Unfortunately it was a bit ahead of it is time, and was considered too unusual, and not commercial enough for mass consumption. No distributor would buy it. So producer Alfredo Leone decided to edit Lisa, seemingly with a chainsaw, by removing just about half of the original film, and adding new scenes, which he filmed two years after the original product! It is important to note that Bava had little to do with these new, hideous additions, so technically House of Exorcism is not a Bava film. The original product is a slow, dreamy, classy production. A few minutes into the film, the viewer is jarred out of this dream world, as suddenly we see Lisa, two years older, and with a very different haircut, begin to writhe on the ground, making guttural sounds and croaking epitaphs like suck my cok, etc. Subtle, huh? And the film continues like this, jumping back and forth between a beautiful, visual film, and a grade Z Exorcist ripoff. Leone was trying to incorporate these shock scenes, while keeping some semblance of a story intact. He failed miserably. When the choice was made to basically destroy Lisa and the devil, Bava himself refused, saying that his film was too beautiful to cut. He was right, and it must have been quite sad for this artist to see all his work destroyed and flushed down the toilet. It was many years before the original Lisa and the Devil was seen again, resurfacing on late night television.

Or Some Came Running Out Of The Cinema. Okay, that is a bit harsh.The film starts in an unintentionally comical way Frankieboy comes back to his hometown after many years this already smells of clich\u00e9s and the whole town is shaken by his arrival he is talked about, everyone wants to talk to him, and every woman he meets flirts with him like there is no tomorrow  even his niece hints that she would gladly have dropped her date to chat with Frankieboy a little longer! Even his pretty niece wants a piece of him! Sounds like one of those laughable Mike Hammer episodes where EVERY single female wants Stacey Keach. And, like Stacey Keach, Frankieboy is anything but a goodlooking womans wet dream. In real life, someone like Sinatra without the fame would not get within 100 m of someone as beautiful as MacLaine. But in this Hollywood movie it is the other way around MacLaine is absolutely nuts about Frankieboy, but HE could not care less! Sinatra plays his cool shtick much too often in his movies, and it is rarely credible. Dean Martin is kind of miscast; he is not miscast as a cardplayer, but rather because of the accent which simply does not suit him. MacLaine is charming as ever, but she plays a caricature  and this reliance on caricatures is one of the basic problems with the film. The main characters are all some sort of stereotypes out of bad or seenitallbefore movies and cheap novels; Frankie is the cool cat who comes back to town to get all the women, and he could not care less about his writing which, predictably, eventually garners recognition; Martin is a sleazy but friendly cardplayer; MacLaine is the dumb, but very likable bimbo; Frankies blond loveinterest is a snotty literary expert; Frankies brother is the successful guy who married into his wifes business and has a lousy marriage; and so on. Clich\u00e9s.The story contains a couple of coincidences which are a little too farfetched for my taste Frankie just happens to bump into his niece in a locale; his niece just happens to be meters away from her daddy when the latter kisses his secretary for the FIRST time; and then there is the awful, stupid ending.In it, a drunk guy bent on killing Frankieboy somehow manages to find him in a carnival of all places! The place is utterly crowded, with the typical noise and chaos  plus it is happening in the evening  and yet the guy somehow finds Frankie in spite of being drunk as a doorknob and shoots at him. But guess who he kills? MacLaine. She jumps in front of the bullet to save Frankie a clich\u00e9 which comicbook writers might cringe at. This utterly pathetic, overdramatic, and annoying ending certainly cannot please any, even semiintelligent, viewer. And this happens on the same day that MacLaine and Sinatra got married! The writer of this nonsense seems to have read crappy dime novels his whole life  how else is the writing of this movie to be explained? There is even a card game in which a brawl ensues with Frankie  Martin vs. some clich\u00e9 caricatures out of the writers vivid imagination. It was like a damn Western suddenly. Another dumb thing is the way Sinatra was crazy about the boring snottynosed bimbo and pretty much ignored MacLaine. As the movie progresses we find out that Sinatra finds MacLaine to be too dumb for him, just as the blond bimbo finds Sinatra to be too lowclass for her. There is a certain snobbism and disdain to be detected in the script regarding MacLaine. MacLaine is treated as worthless by everyone, while the blond bimbo is treated as a princess and an intellectual; the ironic truth is that the latters character comes off as rather dumb and not at all as intellectual; her behaviour, comments, and opinions are mostly clich\u00e9d, silly, confused, pretentious, and primitive. At least MacLaines character KNOWS that she MacLaine is dumb. There is another irony that I did not fail to notice Sinatra had trouble finding an ending for his latest story  much like the writer of this movie, and that is why he came up with the corny, crappy finale.The film basically has a solid cast, and the photography is nice, but the script, though sometimes okay, relies to heavily on silly nonsense instead of on realitybased characters and events.If you are interested in reading my biographies of Shirley MacLaine and other Hollywood intellectuals, contact me by email.","label":0},{"index":11965,"txt":" May contain spoilers.

What a major disappointment.The cast is superb and the production values are firstrate, but the characters are without depth, the plot is thin, and the whole thing goes on too long. For a movie that deals with alcoholism, family divisions, unfaithfulness, gambling, and sexual repression, the movie is curiously flat, prosaic, lifeless, and clicheridden. One example is the portrayal of Frank Hirschs unfaithfuness his rather heavyhanded request to his wife to go upstairs and relax a bit followed by her predictable pleading of a headache, leads  even more predictably  to his evening liaison with his secretary hey Nancy, I have got the blues tonight. Let us go for a drive, all according to wellworn formula. We do not feel these are real people, but cardboard cutouts acting in a marionette play. Also, the source of the obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never really explored or explained. Daves infatuation with the onagainoffagain Gwen is inexplicable in light of her fatuous inability to defecate or get off the pot. His subsequent marriage of desperation to the Shirley MaclaineGinny character is, from the moment of its being presented to this viewer, anyway, obviously doomed to fail, and it was clear  by the conventions of this type of soap opera  that it could only be resolved by someone being killed. The moment the jealous lover started running around with the gun I started a bet with myself as to who  Dave or Ginny  would get killed. The whole thing was phony with a capital P. Having said that, Maclaines performance and that of Dean Martin are the standouts here.

However, then I find out that this film was made in 1989? Say what! Well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, this is just bad. The plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools. Which is odd, in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in a mansion. Makes you wonder how they cannot find money to keep this school alive, have they never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here is the kicker. The school board says that they will keep the school alive, if the students can raise 200,000. So the seniors go about doing this. Hmmm, you raise 200,000 but instead of saving that for college, you put it towards saving the high school that you are a Senior in?

Good grief, what slobs these two babes are!George Seymour Cassell is alone in his San Francisco office and his monstrously expensive home in Tiburon while his wife and child are away in San Diego. Two girls Sondra Locke as Jackson and Colleen Camp as Donna knock on his door, asking directions. Well, it is raining, and they are shivering like two drenched pitiful kittens, and they are not sure of the address they are looking for, and, what with one thing and another, George invites them to come in and partake of his pizza by the fire. All three of them wind up in Georges bath tub and there follows about five minutes of mostly undifferentiated nudity in double exposure, triple exposure, quadruple exposure, and dodekakuple exposure. They spend the night in a threesome and the next morning the girls fix him breakfast. But something has gotten slightly cockeyed because Georgies guests gobble everything down with their fingers and pour ketchup and syrup all over the linen and  You eat like ANIMALS!, George exclaims and tells them to get out. In his dreams. Now, do not get me wrong. Sondra Locke is an extraordinary looking young blond with cobaltblue eyes and Colleen Camp bounces around like a superball. You gotta say, they breed em mighty cute down there in Shelbyville, Tennessee, where Locke comes from, and they breed em with bodacious tushes too, as we cannot help but note after the first five or ten minutes.But when the girls go berserk, so does the movie. The film is thereafter bathed in a garish green light. The pair put on ghoulish makeup and make gargoyle faces at themselves in the mirrors. They brain a delivery boy and then drown him to make sure. They cuss up a storm and smash windows and furniture. They have one of those scenes in which two people sit across the table from one another, licking food and then jumping each others bones. And Georgie? They first render Georgie unconscious with mace which contains nothing that you cannot find in that little red bottle of McIlhenys Tabasco sauce in your kitchen cabinet, tie him up, pour flour and milk all over him, subject him to a psychotic trial, put him through one of those Tolstoytype semiexecutions, slap him around, dress up in outlandish costumes, then prance out on him and his virtually destroyed uppermiddleclass home, and are dispatched by a delivery van ex machina.As for the acting, it is as if someone had told Georgie, First act polite to these girls, then act panicked after you are tied up. And to the girls First act shy, unwilling to impose on anyone, then act crazy. And that is it. The photography and location work are straight out of a 1970s porn movie. I am not sure that suggests a total lack of skill. It takes effort and talent to turn San Francisco ugly. The score gives us two Leitmotivs. Georgies is some pop tune with lyrics about being free and giving in. Jackson and Donnas is a catchy rinkytink thing called My Good Old Dad.

Based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was, I assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and I was in the mood for some good horror. Instead I wound up with the most tedious, preposterous excuse for a lamebrained slasher movie I have seen since the German film Anatomie which this one kinda reminded me of.The plot has potential but it is thrown away within the first 20 minutes. It revolves around innocentnpretty psychology student Angelas Ana Torrent  a Jessica Harper deadringer thesis on the subject of violence in films. Through some farfetched circumstances too dumb to go into here, she winds up in possession of a snuff tape on which two men torture, mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera. Angela, and her horrorbuff friend Chema Fele Martinez are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who is responsible for it.This leads to... well, nothing.They never really give a reason for why they want to find the girls killers since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events, even when their own lives at risk and the mystery itself is as limp as Graham Norton in a room full of bunny girls. There is only one proper clue the type of camera the killers used is discovered and that is a a really weak one and b wheeled out in the first 20 minutes. The rest of the socalled unravelling just occurs through blind luck, increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a SLEW of awful, transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are chucked in merely to pad out the running time.Seriously  Amenabar might know his stuff about ghost stories but he is clearly never read a detective book in his life. The key to a good whodunnit is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence, before moving in for the final twist. In Tesis, POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD the killers identity is guessed correctly by the amateur detectives almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying feebly to throw us off the scent until he runs out of ideas, throws his hands up and says OK, ya got me, it was him after all! As for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes  no such luck. You are watching the wrong movie if that is what you are after.The only thing that drags Tesis down further from just being a dumb, badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous, muddledup point about violence in films. I have no idea what stance it is attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to cram in a ton of misguided, confused psychobabble, in between the rest of the gibberish, and say look at me! I am political!. The final scenes, in which the point of the movie is supposedly hammered home, are so utterly absurd and puerile, one cannot help but wonder if Amenabar feels embarrassed now when he watches this. If he does not, he certainly should. This is total amateur night at the slasher house stuff.Overall I cannot believe I wasted two whole hours it felt like at least six on this, just hoping something might happen. The urban legend of snuff films and that is basically all they are, despite the way this film tries to suggest they are some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world! is an area that can be so tantalisingly exploited in good horror films Videodrome anyone? but it is so easy to step over the line into childlike would not it be cool if! territory with it ie My Little Eye...

I will leave the viewer to see how it all comes to fruition.Overall, not even worth a 1 rental. Borrow it, please. D","label":0},{"index":11996,"txt":"I cannot believe I watched this expecting more. It starts out OK. This movie pushes the limits of reality way to far!! At least the first one was somewhat realistic. It rips off the first movie and even mentions the Joshua Project. Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie. It does have one good message in it though, WATCH OUT FOR BIG BROTHER!!! The movie just makes it seem like Big Brother is way bigger than he actually is in reality. That was very aggravating. Even the makeup on the actors was completely bad. Some of the acting is pretty good. Some of the acting is really bad though. The script was OK at some points and completely messed up at other parts. This movie plays on convenience about every five minutes. Like I said, I cannot believe I watched it expecting more. I think I am gonna pop in the original to get back to earth...Q","label":0},{"index":11997,"txt":"I wondered why John Wood was not playing Dr. Falken until I watched the film. BAD plot, bad science, bad acting and overall a bad film. Please do not watch this film. Rent the original War Games if you are feeling nostalgic.I did not like the bending of the plot to beattheterroristthreat idea either. In the first film W.O.P.R was built because Russia had 1000s of warheads pointed at the U.S.A. In this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat. Politics aside, one of the good thing about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end. No such insight is offered in this film.","label":0},{"index":11998,"txt":"The oddlynamed VeraEllen was to movie dancing what Sonja Henie was to movie iceskating blonde, girlish, always delightful to watch, but not an especially good actress and usually lumbered with weak material. When I watch VeraEllens sexy apache dance with Gene Kelly in Words and Music, I cannot help noticing that her blouse yellow with narrow red horizontal stripes seems to be made out of the South Vietnam flag. For some reason, the very American VeraEllen starred in two musicals made several years apart set in Edinburgh, a city not noted for its tapdancers Let us Be Happy and Happy Go Lovely.In the latter, Cesar Romero plays an American impresario who for some reason is staging a musical in Edinburgh. There is a vague attempt to link this show to the Edinburgh Festival, which is nonsense the Festival is not a showcase for splashy legshows. We also see a couple of stock shots of the Royal Mile apart from a few Highland accents, there is absolutely no attempt to convey Scottish atmosphere in this movie. The funniest gag occurs at the very beginning, when we learn that the title of Romeros show is Frolics to You this is a cheeky pun that Britons will get and Yanks will not.VeraEllen is, as usual, cute and appealing and an impressive dancer, but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad. The plot  mistaken identity between magnate David Niven and reporter Gordon Jackson  is brainless, though no more so than the plots of several dozen Hollywood musicals. Romero is less annoying than usual here, probably because for once he is not required to convince us that he is interested in bedding the heroine.The single biggest offence of this movie is its misuse of Bobby Howes. The father of Sally Ann Howes was a major star of West End stage musicals; his wistful rendition of She is My Lovely was a big hit in Britain in 1937. Here, he shows up in several scenes as Romeros dogsbody but never has a chance to participate in a musical number, nor even any real comedy. It is absolutely criminal that this movie  with a title containing the word Lovely, sure to evoke Howess greatest hit  would cast a major British musical star but give him nothing to do!The delightful character actress Ambrosine Phillpotts whom I worked with once shines in one restaurant sequence, and there is a glimpse of the doomed beauty Kay Kendall. As VeraEllens confidante, somebody named Diane Hart speaks in one of the most annoying voices I have ever heard it sounds like an attempt to imitate Joan Greenwood and Glynis Johns both at the same go, but does not match either. Val Guest has a story credit, but this movie does not come up to the quality of his brilliant comedies. The colour photography is wretched, though I realise that postwar Britain could not afford Hollywoods process work. Happy Go Lovely is at utmost best a pleasant timewaster, with waster being the operative word. I will rate this movie just 4 out of 10.","label":0},{"index":11999,"txt":"After Highlander 2 which I am still in denial about, I thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad. I was wrong. I loved the original Wargames, however, this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames at least had some hacks that worked. Whoever wrote this movie knew NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS except how to use a word processor. I doubt he or she even watched the original movie. The acting is not even convincing. Please save yourselves, under no circumstances watch this movie. I do not care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you cannot turn the TV off. THIS MOVIE WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE.","label":0}]}
