This movie is about as true about the whole Vietnam war as the Rodney King beating is true about ALL police officers. Yes, bad things do and did happen, but in general the people there are just like you and me. They have morals, they are not killing machines, they do not all do drugs. Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They happened far more infrequently than the hype would lead you believe. Oliver Stone has a knack for making movies that show the Vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath, but are based as much in reality as Star Wars. If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favour and learn the truth. Fact the Viet Cong and NVA did far worse things to the South Vietnamese than ANY soldier in the US Armed Forces ever did. Fact the soldiers in World War II treated the enemy far worse in general than the soldiers in Vietnam did, and they were WELCOMED when they came home. The fine Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint, no one could have asked for more from our soldiers, and it is a great disservice to assert that this kind of mostly true fiction is the way things really were there.","label":0},{"index":7002,"txt":"Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stones story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so overdone it is laughable. While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10 year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame weeks gives a horribly skewed picture of the war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killedwounded by friendly fire, 90 killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace. Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam and HBOs A Bright Shining Lie.","label":0},{"index":7003,"txt":"I read one other review that expressed the view that Platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people, being killed, taking drugs and talking trash.I do not agree with that because the film actually had more to it, but it a way, I can see what this person is trying to say this had no real plot  which is a point i agree with.It is selfindulgent Stone at his best. He really wanted to show, not only how war leads to death, but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive. Unfortunately, the film seems to over glorify this aspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne, grandstanding, Oscarhunting let us create an enduring image for my liking.The problem I have with Stone and other filmmakers of his ilk is that they fail to understand this simply concept depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is DOES NOT PROVE OR EVEN REFLECT ON WHETHER it was an unjust or immoral war. We have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with Iraq. In case you are missing the point, let me put it to you bluntly if you saw how truly bloody the second world war was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers, would you think it was an unjust war? If that fact alone does not convince you that it was an unjust war, then why should depictions of the horrors of Vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that instance. Personally, I do not support Americas decision to go to war in Vietnam, but i certainly do not subscribe to the this war is wrong because people died and suffered theory. I do not think that motivations are always wrong by default, just because war in itself is terrible.This says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big twist was a bit stupid. However, this is not Stones first oddball departure. Wall street was a magnificent film, up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful wrong turn. JFK is probably one of the few films Stone did that actually ended very well.But it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around. And this is why i gave it such a low mark. It was virtually storyless and ultimately boring  unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy.","label":0},{"index":7004,"txt":"We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes an id\u00e9e re\u00e7ue few would challenge.

So I was looking forward to his brother and frequent collaborator Jacobs, The Best Thief in the World. This is a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a lowerclass area of New York. The movie is not without its poignant moments. But at times it is as if Kornbluth is working way too hard to state the obvious Life can be very difficult for some people. And life is not fair.More subtle, and more important, is our understanding that despite all of these somewhat abhorrent cultural underpinnings and the antisocial behavior they may spawn, these characters have no shortage of goodness and humanity. We can recoil at their language and their living conditions, but we are cannot discount their intent. And in fact, their struggles to maintain a family under such adversity has a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood, and his compassion for the people is evident throughout.Having said all this, The Best Thief in the World suffers from many painful flaws including the title. The characters are not very believable. The writing is uneven. And the plotline is barely discernible. And for many the most disturbing is that Kornbluth uses two young black boys mimicking gangsta rap between scenes.

Big mistake, but since they are both amoral mobsters, and misogynistic bastards to boot, it is hard to decide whom to root for LESS. Only writerdirector Elaine May could have gotten away with this one. I thought it interesting that in a lengthy interview with producer Michael Hausman included on the DVD, he disclosed that the two stars had very different ideas about the script, that the director was nearly impossible to work with, that the director of photography had impossible demands made of him, that the crew was constantly angry about being made to sit around waiting, and so on.

It lacks the smartness of Seinfeld and the wonderful selfridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of Frasier. The characters in Friends seem designed to make them repellant dullards. This incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl.The unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort.

The trouble with this is, Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing, Friends had and I am being very generous here at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons.It became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that were not that good so start with, then got worse at the 100th time you saw them.

Have not said that Friends was, at best an average sitcom, and not as great as others have made out. Let us face it, if it was not for the casting of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, then who knows whether this show would have lasted as long as it has done. I very much doubt that. Although as the series progressed, Friends got more progressively predictable, lame and boring that I could not care less about the characters of whom are the most overrated in TV history or of their plight, nor of who was sleeping with whom. And it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny. And even when it had all these Alist Hollywood actors from the movie world, I still did not bother to tune in. The writing in Friends became stale that I lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and as for the ending, well it was predictable to say the least.What was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons, whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three, four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good. The show should have came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger salaries. In truth, as much as the series waned, it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way round. When it ended in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom. Now, there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our TV screens very soon. And yet, I for one will not be looking forward to it whatsoever.","label":0},{"index":7020,"txt":"I have a severe problem with this show, several actually. A simple list will suffice for now, I will go into more depth later on superficial characters, a laughtrack and boring humour.If you do not wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior as if you see anything in this show I did not to a frequently irked teen from Canada I will summarize Friends sucks, not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the TV audiences for new, good shows Arrested Development, Dexter etc.. Friends is as much to blame for reality TV, Two And A Half Men and The King Of Queens as the television executives. Now then, on with the review.These characters have no soul, they are exactly the same in every way outside of gender and hair colour. They react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies. Where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it? Why is not Rachel storming out on Monica after Monica starts hanging out with Rachels enemy? Why does not Joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously? Oh right, cause he is the dumb one and he is comfortable with that. This is the curse of having perfect characters lasting conflict and god forbid personality becomes an impossibility.The laughtrack is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born. Any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny. How can I make such a broad generalization? When a show that claims to be comedy requires laughter from someone BESIDES THE AUDIENCE it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it. Laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks. Humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity see The Office, Arrested Development.This leads to my next point the humour is boring. There is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous without a laughtrack apparently simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws. So what if Monica dated a 17 year old? She immediately recognizes that what she is doing is not right and breaks up with him. There has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution. Maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him. That would be great, it would be like a custody battle! So now I have provided evidence for my position. Many of my friends love this show because they have not heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development, many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. I have watched very little of Friends in my life, but I have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show, in my opinion, completely unwatchable.

Personally, like David Spade said, I liked this show better when it went by its original title  Seinfeld. What bothers me the most about this show, aside from the obvious, base sense of humor, and general smuttiness, is the pretentious way the episodes are titled. Truly great shows are still funny after many, repeated viewings, like, the one where Rob gets accidentally hypnotized, on the Dick Van Dyke Show, or the one where Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory. In other words, it is an honor bestowed upon great programs by the viewers. That the writers and producers of Friends would have the unmitigated hubris to actually title the episodes, themselves, in such a fashion, before anyones even had a chance to even see it a second time, speaks to not only the mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of said writers, but, also, of the stultified minds of their viewers.You read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a Hallmark Cardlike Neverland, full of greeting card sentiment.

It attempts to be a scifidramathriller but fails to deliver on any of the three.As a Frankenstein remake this one is missing everything that made the original good. Nobody calls the doctor insane or even threatens to kick him out of the hospital. The transformation scene consists of a coma victim opening one eye and the amazing computer that makes it happen is not even shown. When the experiment works there is no praise, and when it starts going wrong there is little reaction.Any suspense over who the killer might be is shattered by progressively showing him in the same room with all of the possible suspects. Finding the killer is as easy as opening one file and interviewing one person.San Francisco as a setting is both overplayed and underused. The opening sequence hammers home the point that this is happening in SF, a cable car plays a significant role, the leads live in a hilltop Victorian, Pier 39 makes an appearance, and the final showdown happens at Golden Gate Park. More specifically along ten feet of cliff side at the park  just enough to keep the bridge in the picture at all times.

You do not bond with the characters at all, although Shatta has acquired a couple of fan girls. It seems that the writer was more interested in cramming all the drama and complexity he could into this movie than actually exploring his characters motivations and personalities.New, useless story lines were being introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the movie. The writer seriously needed to streamline his story. Perhaps he was trying to be epic, but it was simply too much information for a twohour movie.

Tolstoy Christopher Plummer lives with his family in a compound at Yasnaya Polyana, taking walks and writing and being seen to by his wife and the adherents to his movement, people dedicated to his ideas of pacifism, vegetarianism, sexual abstinence and communal property who have gathered in a forest camp not far away. His wife, Sophia Helen Mirren wars openly with the head of his movement Chertkov Paul Giamatti, who she claims in his efforts to convince Tolstoy to sign the rights to his works over to the Russian people is trying to steal the wealth that is owed to her upon her husbands imminent death. Observing all of this is Tolstoys new steward, Bulgakov James McAvoy, a naive adherent who is torn between his love of the man and concern for his wife.Hoffmans script, which is based on the novel by Jay Parini, quite often veers itself into confused territory, building up a complex tangle of threads and opaque motivations that ultimately do not resolve themselves in any satisfying way. The scope of the film is grand, and its story should reverberate just as Tolstoy, whose beliefs foreshadowed in some ways both the Bolsheviks and those of pacifists like Ghandi. It unfortunately does not, it is ununpickable, building up with much gusto confrontations that are constantly ravelling off into nothingness. The threeway relationship between the Church, the faithful Sophia and the unbelieving Tolstoy, for example, is referenced often. In the last section of the film a mute priest in a magnificent hat even shows up, but the script never expands on this beyond awkwardly inserting it into the story as an attempt at enriching it or providing some semblance of historical accuracy. There are a ton of details in the film, but not enough attention is paid to most of them and as a result the film feels cluttered, overburdened, energetic but unfortunately pointless.At its heart is the love story between Sophia and Tolstoy, and that story, as baffling and cramped as it is, is the reason to watch the film. Mirren and Plummer are, unsurprisingly, the best things in the film. Plummers Tolstoy is vague, at once confused and resolute, apprehensive and full of joy and certainty. Mirrens Sophia is in full panic, in a righteous lather, forced to watch and expected to be mute as her husband gives away his time, his possessions and his money to people who are unquestionably devoted to him but also clearly in possession of their own agendas. They are great performances, all the more so given the vast gulf between the real importance of the couples place in history and the scripts ability to support that, both Sophia and Tolstoy seem willed into the film by Mirren and Plummer alone, both making the best they can out of what meagre material is there. Giammati and McAvoy, both talented actors, are unable to do the same and Giamattis Chertkov seems neither a revolutionary nor a thief and not both at once, either but rather a cipher, a standin for a whole package of unresolved anxieties and aborted historical impulses. The scope of this thing never boils down to anything, it hitches along, getting by on the strength of Plummer and Mirren and not much else. It is interesting and pretty, but ultimately unrewarding. 4.510","label":0},{"index":7029,"txt":"It was pointed out in a now deleted post from another IMDb user that anyone who might see The Medusa Touch should be warned about a scene that is eerily reminiscent of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in NYC. But I hope anyone reading this will consider this warning. Despite an interesting pedigree producer Elliott Kastner produced Harper and The Long Goodbye; coproducer Arnon Milchan coproduced the Oscarnominated L.A. Confidential and screenwriter John Briley won an Oscar for Gandhi and an international cast, I found The Medusa Touch to be a heavyhanded, unintentional laugh riot. It was a poorly directed, horribly written and acted mess. It tried to capitalize on the 70s telekinetic thrillers genre. The movie fails on many counts. Please consider Carrie and the underrated The Fury both directed by Brian DePalma.

You have seen it all before Burton plays a writer who discovered at an early age he possesses the power to move inanimate objects through force of his mind and you thought Carrie had no impact on Hollywood!. Though adapted from a novel by Peter Van Greenaway, Medusa plays like recycled goods, though the special effects in the cathedral finale are solid if typical.

Burton is hammy but weary...not even telekinesis could save him at this point. 12 from ","label":0},{"index":7031,"txt":"What a great actor to have in such an awful story...The film and its production, however, is quite good, even though set in London but with exteriors in Bristol. No matter \u0096 see one cathedral, you have seen em all, sort of.The story however...is about a man born with the power to wreak death and destruction upon anybody and anything, should he so wish. With just a passing reference to true life instances of telekinesis, the narrative builds a picture of a man misused and misjudged as a boy, a teenager and finally as a man; so much so, in fact, that he exacts vengeance at will, literally. Over time, he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is heading the wrong way and thus sets out to destroy the lot \u0096 just by thinking about it!The trouble with the narrative, however, is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and merge it all with quasireligious claptrap to produce a hodgepodge theory about it all. Mixing fact and fantasy in this fashion rarely works \u0096 and I am afraid Richard Burton had to overact awfully on some occasions when trying to sound convincing. His very best scene, however, is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal pasting as they left his home sharp, witty and deadly dialog, delivered as only Burton could.A good supporting cast helps to make things look and sound a lot better, though, beginning with Lino Ventura, whom I last saw in Garde A Vu 1981, as Inspector Brunel; Harry Andrews as Assistant Commissioner; the much underrated Lee Remick as Dr Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi as a publisher, Towney, and a few other well known character actors.I liked the way the story was presented, as flashback within flashback to fill in the back story and thus solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of Morlar Richard Burton, the writer with the killer disposition. Up till that point, it was a good piece of visual detective work by Brunel and his English sidekick. Still, it was very predictable as it became quickly very obvious to me about the identity of the wouldbe murderer.Then, they went and spoilt it all in the last fifteen minutes. If you want a clue about what that is, think Samson and Delilah 1949, from the illustrious Cecil B. de Mille, and how Samson got the bad guys in the end. And, the very last scene is just plain stupid. Why? Because there are at least a hundred ways that Morlars rampaging could have been stopped, absolutely.Shame, actually, because this could have been a lot better story and movie. I guess Burton really needed the money.If you are Burton fan, then spend the time to see that scene I mentioned above.

The Wizard is a lateeighties film about a seriously silent boys ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits. The Wiz is an unnecessary update of The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is that guy that attached 100 straws together and had some kid drink tang out of it.Now that we have gotten all that out of the way, let me say this there is really no reason to see this movie. It is simply a 100 minute Nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the Powerglove, the Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word designed in the loosest sense possible, because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team of people who had never played Nintendo, and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother. Maybe if the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together, they would realize that they were about to film total rubbish and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereos.I hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you. It sure has not been for me. In fact, I think I might have lost a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it.

Well if that IS the case, and I did not miss anything... how did Fred Savages character, and even the girl, know so much about the game already? We are talking things that some people do not know about by their second or third playthrough.Beyond the factual and gaming errors there is the general low quality of the film itself. Nothing here is honestly very memorable. The kid was not even that good at playing video games in the footage they showed. A lot of kids I knew way back in those days were significantly more experienced. On top of all this the acting and storyline are just mediocre at their strongest points. The characters are bland and completely uninteresting, the Wizard the youngest child is a very silent, completely dry child clich\u00e9 of a little kid who almost never talks because of a trauma. It is not that this is unrealistic, it is the fact that it had to be thrown into the movie to actually even begin to form a plot that would exceed even 30 minutes.Honestly, the only value that is to be found here is that of a nostalgic nature. If you grew up with this movie you are going to like it whether it was good or not. It was about kids playing video games, and at the time you saw it you likely had an obsession with the NES as well.

Wooden acting, poor special effects, the only comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is over as soon as she has done her obligatory bmovie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie. The opportunity to have made what could have been a decent movie disappears the moment Nicole Eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds, whilst the Police, Military and Joe public do not cotton on that the woman drinking coffee, dosnt use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once.

Every episode follows the same format where many parts seem totally scripted which they are and tears flow seemingly on cue. The attempt to manipulate the viewer with a mixture of emotional breakdowns and sad music is a real turn off for me. The fact that everyone who donates something to the house, be it Sears or whoever, has to plug themselves for being generous is also annoying. Probably the biggest problem I have with it all is that what must be huge amounts of money and a small army of workers are combined to build an amazingly over the top home for a single family. Now I know that this amount of money is nothing but a drop in the bucket for DisneyABC but how much more could be done for more people with the amount they are putting on one house? Instead of focusing on one family and getting them all to cry during the episode why not help 10 families and show highlights? Is not life difficult enough for the average person? Why do I need help finding things to feel sad about, why not show something truly inspiring without being manipulative? I know what is being done for these families is good, but they are also being used for ratings. You cannot tell me they are not being coached sometimes on the crying. I guess when I see these people moving into a home that most hard working people in the U.S. could not afford for their children it really bothers me. I cannot help but think of what could really be done with a small portion of Disneys money. Instead of giving each member of the family a flat screen TV and or personal shower that tells you the water temperature and shoots out of the ceiling why not help more people afford food, clothes, education and medical insurance?

You might as well watch Remember the Titans and at least not mix Christ in a football film like a formulaic steroid for losers. Let me make some really pressing comments of what bothered me in this film.1. The school was in Georgia and was a white academy school. I did not notice a single black student or player in the school. I deal with the White Christian Academies in the south and they were built for no other reason than to reestablish segregation. This is troubling when the movie is about Christianity and Christ changing lives...how about changing the hearts of segregation? note I loved the token black coach; like it made up for the entirely white team and all the black Giants players. 2. The uncritical acclaim by everyone Christian about this movie. Can I get a couple people to say that it was bad acting, bad filming, bad writing and in short poor compared to other movies. If we were to compare this to another football movie, would it have the same charisma and energy? 3. The halfbaked Christianity which was shown made even less sense to me than the unrealistic ending. If Christianity is about simply reading a little scripture and praying to begin a complete life change, then do not wonder when no one will listen to what Christians have to say. We want to sell Christ as a cureall. He does not need sold and He does not need to be attached to such whimsical lifestyles. No wonder everyone considers Christianity to be antiintellectual with this unreal presentation.I recognize this film may be inspirational to a few people. To most, it will not be. It will not give a real picture of struggle and heartfelt tension. Most importantly to me, it is not Christian by any means or stretch. It has values but it falls short as a pullyourselfupbythebootstraps message as shallow as positive thinking. If you live alongside people who struggle andor those in third world living conditions, this movie will be hollow as most churches are today in their religion.","label":0},{"index":7076,"txt":"This movie is not about football at all. It is about JesusGOD!! It is the same kind of sappy sanctimonious religious drivel you get from those arch idiots who wrestle for Jesus, or pump iron for Jesus. Yeah, Jesus was totally buffed, liked contact sports, and definitely owned a full set of dumb bells. DUHHH! This movie should have been entitled Hiking for Jesus, or something along those lines just to let the general public know that the real intent of this movie is to convert people to Christianity, and to pander to those whose brains have already been thoroughly washed in the blood of the lamb. That the title is derived from the Bible is made clear when the head coach is reading his Bible and asking Jesus for help. The recent sports movie Invincible was 100 times more inspiring than this was, and Jesus was not even a factor. It was just the desire and determination of an individual with a dream.Any broad appeal as an inspirational sports movie is ultimately lost amidst all of the blatant Bible thumping and sanctimonious religious propaganda. One gets the impression that the sole message is the only way you can succeed and make positive gain is if you accept Jesus as your personal savior. But this is simply not true, and is therefore a lie being perpetuated by those who believe that it is true and want everyone else to believe it. The image of the winning athlete thanking Jesus when he wins comes directly to mind. What does he do when he loses? Does he curse Jesus? Of course not! When he loses Jesus is not responsible. Jesus is only responsible when he wins. And the logic goes round and round and round, and it ends up exactly where the true believer needs it to be, every time!! I had to hit pause when the scene with the coach receiving a brand new truck came on so I could stop rolling on the floor laughing my ass off and catch my breath. Materialism is not what Jesus taught. I find it odd that most so called Christians seem to either forget or ignore this message from their savior, especially when I see a Jesus fish on the back of a huge gas guzzling SUV that passes me like I am standing still.Another message this movie implies is that Jesus apparently cares more about the win loss record of a mediocre high school football team that he does about the millions of starving children in the world. The final scene where the insecure and unsure kicker boots a 51 yard field goal and it is hyped up as an unbelievably incredible miracle puts the final gag me with a spoon religious red flag on this turkey.

Then there are the parables.Two farmers prayed for rain but only one prepared his field to receive it. Which one do you think God blessed? This rhetorical question is meant to foreshadow the miraculous climax, in the course of which Coach asks his trepidous backup kicker, Son, do you think God could help you make that kick? It is the kind of entertainment we could have expected would receive faithbased funding ad infinitum, if only the Evangelical Christian Bush Administrations hegemonic pursuits around the world had convinced us all to become devout after their example.

Well, we all know zealots cannot lose. Put it this way Transfer the playing ground to the deserts of the Middle East, replace the Christian proselytizing, and this virulent nonsense can easily be repackaged as a TalibanvsSuperpower parable, which the devout worshippers of this garbage might want to think about a minute.Luckily they will not care, nor need to like Coach tells his team of earnest empty vessels pregame, the answers are all right here in this Book.

I get hounded by statements like these I cannot believe you did not like it! It was made totally by Christians! Everyone donated their time and no one was paid for the movie! It was made by a church and not Hollywood. We should spend our money on movies like this! They only used 100,000 to make the film. This is by a real church and Christian school in Georgia! A preacher wrote and directed it. So, apparently, the reason I should love this movie is simply because of the way it was made and the minimum amount of money used to make it and that is was made by Christians. That is all that is needed for me to love the movie.Look, I got the movie without knowing ANYTHING about the background of the film. I had never heard of it and had no idea  other than football  what it was about. I watched it like I watch any other movie and was disappointed. I was disappointed in the lousy editing and lame script. I was VERY disappointed on the resolution after the climax. Do not worry. There have been other cheap movies and other EXPENSIVELY made movies that have earned less respect from me. It is not about the making of the movie. It is the end product.The writer acknowledges that God does not say yes to everything we pray for in the way we want, but he wanted to show by having faith, God changes our lives. That is true. However, God can change our lives and we are still infertile. God can change our lives and we do not get a raise from our job. God can change our lives and our car is still an old jalopy. God can change our lives and our house is still stinky. Why did not he portray that in the movie? Others voiced their concern to the writerdirector over the matter, but apparently, he was defensive.I did not think the acting was horrible nor many of the landscape shots. I like the idea of going to God and recognizing His awesome power and our weakness.The writing and directing were very weak. It is easy to distinguish this because many of the characters have no development. All we really get from the coachs wife is she is not pregnant well, until the end of the movie. It seems as if there was only ball player that had the potential to have an interesting character and that was chopped to bits into I have a cripple father and I cannot play football well, but I will kick the winning field goal even though I have never kicked a real field goal before. Another problem was the Christian school itself. Umm, I have worked for two Christian schools, went to one myself, and have had many nieces and nephews in other Christian schools. All in all, I have had some pretty close connections with about ten different ones. NONE of the problems that I have seen in ALL of these schools were addressed. I saw this as totally surreal in the movie about their school and wished they had shown the human factor. It would have been nice to see a dose of reality and how God can work.I will close by stating that every work  either written or drawn or played on an instrument  shares the artists world view. The world view that was shown to me in this movie consists of People who pray the right way win ball games, get new cars, conceive when they could not, get a raise, and get their house fixed  all within a short time span. I know. I should LOVE the movie simply due to the sincerity of the people who made it.

This means I have seen a great many movies, from good to bad, and can wholeheartedly claim that Facing The Giants is, in fact, NOT a good movie. It has good intentions, but fails to meet many if any basic standards that I associate with a quality filmgoing experience.The Acting Mostly Terrible, Palatable At Best. Hearing that most were apparently volunteers does not at all surprise me.The Dialogue Clumsy, cheesy, the script comes off as a long version of some cheesy skit you would see performed in Sunday School or youth group function. The Rave Review Robots revel in the absence of meaningless words, but the cold hard truth is that such words are a part of the real world, and the complete absence of it is palpable. Let us just say the mean ol head coach of a team in a State Championship game would have a lot more to say than OH NO! when things are not going his way.The Plot Mindbogglingly predictable. It has been commented that this movie is not a Hollywood clich\u00e9, and yet it is like it was pulled directly from Making An Underdog Sports Movie For Dummies including the mandatory quasiromantic subplot for the ladies and just had a Christianthemed coat of paint slapped on it. I am not lying or bragging when I say I had almost every major detail in both the plot and subplot pegged immediately upon their inception. Only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in their whole life would be emotionally stirred by the story presented here.The DirectingEditing It, too, was patterned almost exactly after the generic Underdog Sports Movie template. Still, acting aside, there were not many noticeable goofs, so at least Facing The Giants was technically competent.The Message Ask Jesus and He will grant all your wishes. Part of me hoped that this movie would end in the teams eventual defeat to really emphasize the whole If we lose, we praise You part, because in the Real World, you WILL fail at one point or another and it is good to be prepared for that. But in the world of Facing The Giants, if you fail, clearly someone either screwed up or is cheating. Another interesting question being, what if the Eagles came across another team that had gotten religion? Would they be caught in an endless loop of miraculous plays and lastminute saves, or would the universe simply have exploded? The Bottom Line For the hardcore conservative Christian Parents crowd lamenting the evils of Hollywood, Facing The Giants will be another mediocreatbest Christian film to hold up on a pedestal as the preferred model for modern filmmaking. For everyone else, the effects will range from boredom to a burning desire to be watching something else. And a warning Any attempt to show this to nonChristians will lead not to conversion, but to derision.

Then some adult couple at a churchrelated Christmas party misled themselves into giving a copy of this movie to every single family in attendance, and now my household is stuck with the film though it thankfully still remains in its shrinkwrap. I cried bitter tears over these sad events, and heres why First off this film has good intentions, especially if you are a Christian like me. This movie is trying to show that you should put your faith in God and that it will make your life better. Not so bad, right? Eh. It turns out a be a problema big one. This movie was made by a church, so of course every single issue has to be dealt with as tastefully for Christians as possible. It is all blackandwhite, no gray areas. Gods grace and will in this movie is a predictable thing, and it comes instantly to all those who do His bidding.This is not the God I know. This is not the Christian life I am familiar with. The God I believe in is a powerful and trustworthy God, but He is not one that grants my every wish. I follow Him as best I can, though the going is often hard; yet the football team in this movie finds their humility and selfcontrol a lot easier than anyone should EVER find it. I cannot relate to cardboard cutouts who flip from badside to goodside in the course of a few structured movie scenes. And when I DO follow His commandments as laid out in the Bible, I certainly do not find myself showered in blessing as these characters do. The largest of my immediate rewards is knowing that I have done the right thing; everything else comes with long, messy, arduous work.But take the example this movie sets Grant Taylor coaches the football team at Shiloh Christian school, which has had 6 losing seasons in a row. He may lose his job over it, and he and his wife are low on money as it is. They want a baby, but the doctor tells him he is sterile. Oh, and his car does not work. And the boys on his football team are disrespectful to their parents, whiny after their million losses, and bad at kicking field goals. This is sure one rundown community here.But wait, Grant Taylor decides he is going to trust in God for everything! And he passes on his faith to his team. So far, so good. Not for long. As they begin to obey, blessing literally POUR in on them. Suddenly the students stop disrespecting their parents; the school has a big revival; the team starts winning EVERY game; they even win the grand championship against the hardest team in the league! Coach Taylors job is reassured; the school gets him a shiny new truck as a present which, by the way, is the epitome of shallow, fairweather employers; he gets a raise; his wife get this even gets pregnant from his sterile sperm! And that skinny kid manages to kick his first darn field goal right when it really matters!! Wowzers, woot, yay, praise the Lord, etcetera, etcetera!!! ...Yipe. Just YIPE. Nobody in my church has ever experienced Christ in a such a cutanddry manner. Yes, there have been miracles aplenty in my family, as well as gifts and creature comforts, and I attribute them to Gods grace and lovingkindness. But God is not some faucet tap that you turn on and off by being good or bad! He is by and large a mystery; His gifts come unexpectedly, often when you think you do not need them but you really do. It is a long, hard slog to the road of fulfillment, and things NEVER turn out the way you thought they would.This movie has good intentions. But because of its supreme shallowness and total escapism, it tanks tremendously to a 110. The bad acting and sports movie clich\u00e9s seem to be mere pimples next to the leprous falsehoods that this movie inadvertently pushes.To all you future churches planning to make a movie do not be afraid to show REAL life, even you have to add some inconvenient truths into the mix. However much the baser populace is wowed by this cotton candy treat, nobody has learned anything substantial from it. Give us the meat, the bones, the REAL stuff!

Then I watched it. The acting was not the best. That is forgivable. It is the message that is not Give Jesus your life and everything will change  you will tackle better, make amazing catches, stop fumbling, start making touchdown passes, and even make the playoffs. All because Jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into AllAmerican athletes. I laughed out loud when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals. But wait, that is not all. You will get a brand new truck, a 6000 raise, and you and your wifes struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy  twice. THEN you will win the state championship because God helps a weakling kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than he is ever kicked before  and into the wind, no less  all because God wanted him to make it. Then you will win the state championship again the next year. None of this good stuff would have happened if the team had not chosen to follow Jesus will all their hearts.Heres what I took away from the movie God can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it  and it is all about making our lives better, easier, and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win games. Which bible is this story based on? I will bet Saint Stephen wished he would known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death.

With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke, you would expect more from the film than it actually delivered. Most of this, I suspect, is because of a secondrate script, as director Henry Hathaway was a competent and wellestablished man at the helm.The film is set in East Africa during WWIIjust before the Americans entered the war. The Brits are trying to control their African colonies while subversive Nazi elements are trying to stir up trouble among the locals. One of the white men in the film is a doubledealerworking for the destruction of the British Empire! But, lovely Tierney, playing a sultans daughter!, is out to help save the day for good ol Britain.American film makers have long sided with the Empire and the 1930s and 40s saw a plethora of proempire films. Nowadays, with changed sensibilities, the notion of seeing the happy black natives dying for Queen and country seems ridiculousand it would be hard to root for either side! Still, in its day, this propaganda piece was effective in drumming up support for the Britishthough when seen today, the film suffers from a longwinded script and silly casting.

I have seen Sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn.

I would like to argue that instead of banning challenging, controversial movies the censors should consider banning films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your IQ and your sanity. If they were to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be Stroker Ace. This film is awful with a capital A. It is the worst film Burt Reynolds ever starred in.... quite a feat for for a man with Cannonball Run II, Cop And A Half and RentACop on his CV!The waferthin story introduces us to successful stock car racer Stroker Ace Reynolds, a man who loves fast cars and fast women. He gets stuck in a demeaning contract with crooked promoter Clyde Torkle Ned Beatty. The contract requires him to do some humiliating promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants, such as dressing up as a giant chicken. Thrown into the mix are Lugs Jim Nabors, Aces dimwitted pal, and Pembrook Feeney Loni Anderson, a bimbo with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea who is wooed by Ace.Hal Needham, the director of this lowgrade garbage, was formerly a stuntman and he made numerous films that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular stunts and car chasesraces. Some of these films were OK, like Hooper and Stunts Unlimited, but with Stroker Ace he reaches a career nadir. The characters are so stupid that you actually feel pity for the actors playing them. Anderson especially is saddled with such a dumb role that it makes you grind your teeth with despair. The humour is weak and infantile throughout, and the stunts and race sequences are unremarkable. Even the outtakes during the closing credits which can be found in all the ReynoldsNeedham collaborations are generally unfunny, which gives the impression that maybe the film was not much fun to make. Stroker Ace is a stinker of considerable magnitude.","label":0},{"index":7089,"txt":"Janeane Garofalo has been very public in her displeasure about this film, calling it, among other things, antifeminist. She has also said on her radio show she hates making romantic comedies because she does not believe in them. I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here. This film is a trifle at best. She does her best, but overall, it was just another boring, unbelievable romantic comedy that has no basis in the real world. Whereas there will be some who will say suspend your disbelief, one grows tired of having to suspend it nearly every time you get a romantic film from Hollywood. Janeanes character, for some reason, is usually filmed in shadows and darkness, which makes her look unattractive, while Umas character is filmed in lighter tones which probably displeased Janeane and is probably one of the reasons she detests this film. That really hurts the film if we are to buy the premise that Janeane is supposed to be the better looking of the two. As many have said here and on other comment threads, Janeane is not ugly, but in fact, quite beautiful. I have not read one review where someone said Uma was better looking. Having said that though, I believe that Ben Chaplins character would more than likely stay with Uma, not Janeane. Many men do not like really intelligent women and many women do not like really intelligent men, and sadly, Ben probably would have stayed with Uma. And despite the directors attempt to make Janeane unattractive, it does not work. Her natural beauty comes through anyway.I think a lot of Janeanes male fans who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves in the Ben Chaplin character, and actually scoring with Janeane. Janeane is a lot more complicated than the character she plays here real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine, so take a cold shower gentlemen. This is the role that Janeane is best known for, and that is a shame, as this really is not that good of a film.","label":0},{"index":7090,"txt":"I liked it but then I think I might have been ironing at the same time.

Playing the Frasier of Pets, she finds herself caught in a love trap when insecurity leads her to pass her best friend Uma Thurman off as herself when a caller comes acourtin.This is an interesting film in the fascinating career of Ben Chaplin. An average British actor, he gave the Hollywood treadmill a shot with this film. He is unremarkable and his anonymity in studio productions is unsurprising on the basis of it, although he has appeared in substantial cameos in both the later Terence Malick films.

Game On is a funny British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and star in this film. He failed thank God.The film is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour Uma Thurman to date Ben Chaplin because she thinks Ben Chaplin will not like her because she is ugly. The film is just bad for so many reasons. The plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit. Those two scenes made me cringe! Janeanes character is sickeningly arrogant and guessing from her role as standup comedienne and archfeminist is in real life too. She claims that the film is antifeminist when in fact it is just realistic. Men more often than not go for looks over personality. It is interesting to note her hypocrisy too. She would been a feminist and comedienne for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad. I imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film. I mean come on! She acted in it for Heavens sake! What this film was really was antimen if anything. It portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurmans character Noelle.There are other bad things about this film too like Ben Chaplins character being the British man every American girl finds cute and Jamie Foxx being the token black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure. Is that the best the script writers could come up with? Blimey they have never done that before except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore film ever made. There is also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is. The other comments on here all say how Janeane Garofalo is not ugly but is actually beautiful. Erm was I watching the same film as they were? She is certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one. Although having said that, I fail to see the appeal of Uma Thurman as well she is lanky and gaunt looking.I guarantee three things about this film if you have never watched itYou will know what the ending will be;You will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and;You will be bored after ten minutes.Watch at your own peril.","label":0},{"index":7092,"txt":"I had no real expectations going into this movie and I am glad.

There is scarecrows. I think the title Scarecrows was sufficient.Second, not a damn thing is ever explained regarding the scarecrows and paranormal occurrences. There is too many times where I was left going WTF?Third, the movie takes itself seriously. I am all for a Bmovie with buckets of blood, screaming women, and senseless violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or ancient curse. But those movies often know they are Bmovies and even flaunt it, like Dead Snow hilarious Scandanavian zombie flick or Evil Dead 2.

As it stands, it is still a creepy film that has solid makeup and gore effects, and a premise that sustains the mood of terror in spite of itself. And hey, there are no teenagers getting killed one by onejust dumb adults, so that is a refreshing change of pace. And the plot line is amazingly similar to Dead Birds, with a precipitating robbery, an abandoned spooky house in the middle of nowhere, and demonic monsters. But just like Dead Birds, the adults are still witless, they run around cluelessly before getting slaughtered one by one, and they ignore the obvious danger.In Scarecrows, though, we never really find out the supernatural why, and that sustains the atmosphere of creepiness. And like clowns, scarecrows can be very creepy; unless they look like Ray Bolger, of course. Escaping in a hijacked plane with the pilot and his daughter, after a robbery netting millions, a paramilitary bunch is doublecrossed by one of their own; a very nervous guy named Burt. He jumps out of the plane with the big, and heavy, box that holds the money with apparently no plans as to how to move it around once he is on the ground. Being the dumbest of the bunch, he is murdered first. But not before he happens upon the Fowler residence, nestled snuggly amid lots of really creepylooking scarecrows, and surrounded with a wooden fence encircled with barbedwire and lots of warnings to stay away. And the weird weathervane on the roof, with the pitchfork and pterodactyl, should have been a warning sign, too. The inside of the house is also quite foreboding to us in the audience, anyway.Annoyingly, we must listen to Burts thoughts in voiceover, as he walks around and mysteriously comes across the key to the decrepit truck in the yard. The way the key pops up would be enough to have my pantswith me in themflying out the door. Perhaps it is just me, but I really enjoy watching peoples lips move on screen, even when they are just thinking out loud. It helps to intensify the action, and gives the actor more to do than just look like what the voiceover is saying. Burt hoists the box onto the truck and makes his getaway. Sure why not? decrepit trucks always have lots of gas in them, especially with todays prices, and the battery? no problem. Now, I did mention that Burt was the dumbest of the bunch, and here is why in addition to the above, of course. Wearing nightvision goggles to walk through the foliage and find the house, he takes them off to drive the truck away, and instead, turns on the headlights to see where he is going. Of course, the crooks still in the plane spot the headlights of his truck, and know where he is headed. Brilliant. He deserves to die. Definitely. I am not sure why he needed night vision goggles in the first place, as every scene is brightly lit, from the interior of the plane, to the nighttime outside scenery, and the house. The cinematographer was either a. myopic, b. just out of school, or c. dealing with really cheap filmstock.Burt meets his demise when the truck dies in the middle of nowhere. Go figure. One very nice touch, and there are, I must admit, a few in the film, is the fact that when he opens the trucks lid, there is no engine. Creepy, to be sure and insert pants comment again here. The story logic fails when dead, nowstuffedlikeaflounderwithmoneyandstrawBurt returns to the house. The rest of the bunch are there, rough him up, then realize that he is indeed dead, and was gutted and stuffed like a flounder with money and straw. Dead Burt does manage to put up quite a fight, though, and grabs one fellow by the mouth, pushing him through a window, causing him to bite off more than he could chew in a gorylicious scene. At this point, you would think they would would be racing out of the house and back to the planebut noooo, they decide to stay and look for the rest of the money. In fact, the whole Burt is dead episode is treated rather matteroffactly, although one bright bulb in the bunch does argue, Burt was walking around dead, for chrissakes!The stolen money suddenly appears on the grounds outside the house, and the crooks blithely go for the bait. Soon, another one of them, Jack, is dispatched, and again the scene is well done and horrific, involving a dull handsaw and no anethesia. Now there are three scarecrows going about wreaking mayhem, and one of them needs a hand, literally.When one of the crooks sees the scarecrows and Jack getting scarecrowized, he starts screaming, running away like hell, and shooting off his gun in typical paramilitary fashion. So much for all that training under pressure crap. He meets up with the others and stops in his tracks to explain why he is screaming, running away like hell, and shooting off his gun, even though the scarecrows appear to be chasing him. Again, that script logic thing... Dead and gutted, Jack returns to the house, and goes after the screamer with the usual results. If you listen to Jacks demonic growl, by the way, you may notice, depending on your age, that it is the same monstergrowling sound heard often in the Lost In Space TV episodes.The last two survivors race away from the house and back to the plane, barely escaping.

Well, I cannot imagine anyone liking this movie because it is just bad, bad, bad.It is obvious that whoever made this movie does not know a single thing about horror. The whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres action movie guns and criminals and horror living scarecrows. When the criminals are killed one by one by the poky looking scarecrows, the two genres automatically cancel each other out because, first, they are criminals and who cares about criminals, and second, because they are stupid criminals to boot! Having zombie scarecrows go after them just does not work here. Where is the horror in that? I wanted the criminals to die horrible, painful deaths.But the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres, which could have been original if handle well, NEVER gels. We are simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of scarecrows, which are alive for whatever flimsy reason the filmmakers thought up. Making things even worse is the fact that the cinematography is terrible TV like and, worse offense of all, whole bunches of the dialogue are told on CBs, and we continuously hear inane dialogue spoken over disconnected images as if we are watching some sort of Radio show. This part was really BAD. The director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea! I cannot tell you how annoying that was.As I have already mentioned, the criminals in SCARECROWS are amazingly stupid. For instance, when someone suddenly shows up, gutted and filled with money and straw yep, straw in his huge open wound, the others ask What drug is he on? after they shoot tons of bullets in him, unable to kill him he is been zombiefied by the scarecrows. Do not ask.... Get a freaking clue, morons. I have never seen such stupid people in a movie. And then there is the girl. I wished one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she was a pain in the butt. When she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow cross, she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene bad acting, even though the criminals could not have done it. What a dimwit she was! But the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick. They are not scary. Nothing much is explained about them. They are just a plot device in this plot device filled movie.Mr Wesley, filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 seconds nonstop does not elicit anything but sheer boredom.

A lot of the time it is hard to figure out what is actually happening, and although some shots of the scarecrows were creepy, most were hard to even see.

However, by this film, the familiar Little Tramp character was still in development. Sure Charlie looked the part, but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed. Instead, Chaplin often hit, kicked or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason at all.As for this very slight film, it is interesting to watch for the cast. While they are not familiar today, Chaplin stars along with Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swainall exceptionally popular stars with Keystone Films. The problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes, the plot seems very vague and improperly developed. Chester and Mabel got to the race track a very common theme in Keystone productionsit must have been located near a race track. Charlie and Mack show up and sneak in. Mack is chased by the police for doing this while Charlie slaps Chester around and steals his girl. In the end, for no apparent reason, the cops take Chester and Mack awayleaving Charlie with Mabel who, oddly, did not seem put off by Charlies boorish behaviors.Unless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian, this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of Chaplin.

When she is the victim of another attack on the streets of New York, comic book artist Roberts moves to a small town out West. In her first days there, she meets the suspiciously crazy Randall Atkins Craig Sheffer, playing this part well who will eventually not leave her side. Fearing for her safety after having been in the situation already twice before, she strikes up a friendship and relationship with the suspiciously amicable town cop, Steve Smith D.B. Sweeny, who is character does not seem convincing enough, leaving disbelief among viewers who should otherwise be convinced of the red herrings thrown by the writers. Smith needs Roberts cooperation because, as he tells her, Atkins is an excon and guilty of sexual assault. But, the cops have lacked the evidence to put him away before.The movie had enough ploys to at least make an interesting movie because soon enough, there is such confusion as to whom Roberts should trust. However, much of the intended suspense appears too forced because Roberts character never seems to react to simple things as we think any reasonable person might. And her delayed responses allow much of that suspense to occur to easily and unconvincingly, particularly in the finale. Perhaps Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role; too baby faced in ways that kind of recall Kevin Andersons persona evident in his character in Sleeping With the Enemy. Or, if Lisa Roberts was written as a stronger character, this might suffice as well.

Instead, what we get it a hodgepodge of clips of people moving around big items of scenery, vaguely help together with a commentary which failed to hold my attention.

Which is not to say they did not try, but having the stagehands relate a synopsis of the Ring cycle as the programs narrative does nothing to tell us about the job of physically mounting an opera.We see lots of things happening, but are told little about what it is that the people are doing and why. There is little sense of who is who, or how the various production departments fit and work together. For instance, several times we hear about a problem of some sort  one expects then to see the problem and its consequences andor how it gets resolved.

You either enjoy the packaging, or forget about it.The film is not without its point and purpose War is a not a good thing. Well, is not that original! The moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out. And even that feeble insight is undercut by a story in which elements of war  war toys in particular  are clearly a bad thing, until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys. It is like someone preaching a stern, condescending sermon, only to end by saying Just kidding.But even as an empty box, the film fails close scrutiny. Yes, it is a sight to behold with some remarkable, striking images. The sets are imaginative and the cinematography catches the colorful scenes with skill. But the images are cold and emotionally sterile. Like the screenplay, the look of the film is joyless and at times aesthetically barren and surreal. It is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things, yet shows them to be creations of a world that is empty and cold. The film strives to be funny, in a morose sort of way, but the humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, as the beleaguered heir to a toy manufacturing empire, tosses in his adlib shtick, which only seems alien to the bizarre, coldly structured world he is inhabiting. Indeed, the topical references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered throughout are jarringly contradictory to the childlike fable the film is vaguely trying to be. For this film to work, or make sense, it needs to be set in its own universe, an Oz far removed from Kansas. Every time the jokes jerk us back into reality, the toyland of the film increasingly becomes an obvious sham.It is said that this was director Barry Levinsons pet project, one that he had been striving to get made for ten years. It is sadly obvious why he had trouble getting backing. Like most pet projects that finally get made RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER  BATTLEFIELD EARTH being great examples it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmakers field of vision. Perhaps Levinson directed and redirected TOYS so often in his head that he no fresh vision for it when he finally got on the soundstage.

She is all business, but becomes all gushy when she is awarded an honorary degree from Good Hope College, where she was expelled for the crime of having stayed out all night the parallel to Joans real life is unmistakable here, as it is in all Joan Movies. The degree causes much consternation on campus That would make it the most broadminded institution in the history of education! \u0096 but Joan is unaware of this as she arrives. The college president, Jim Merrill, played by Robert Young, at his handsomest, happens to be Joans former teacher \u0096 and lover.

But you not only like Eve in this, as in all her roles, you adore her. She is so droll and nononsense, you would like to pay her just to hang around and be one of the boys.

But Joan says that maybe others only see a collection of buildings, she, Joan, sees youth \u0096 herself at 18 eager, expectant \u0096 a little frightened, asking What is life? What am I? But, of course, if we actually go into depth about Joan at 18, the truth may be a little different. For me, this is the major problem in watching any Joan movie. You can call her characters whatever you want to, but it is always all Joan, all the time. So, since what we are always seeing is Joan being herself, it is easy to dispense with characters names. It is just that it gets confusing when Joan tries to tell us something patently untrue, like her description of herself at 18 \u0096 when we know that at 18, Joan had already been around the block several times. Many men would have described her as eager, and as far as being expectant, she had already had several abortions at this point.

It fails. What also fails is an attempt at early50s political correctness. In the story, Joan has written a book about free speech and made a film no, not the one about the plumber, and she attracts the attention of an early 50s campus radical, Dr. Pitt, who is about to be fired for his views, which are shockingly similar to Joans.

I had high hopes for Horrorfest that year, which was also the first year I attended Horrorfest, and I have to say Horrorfest and all of its films take false advertising to a whole new level. Mad kudos to the advertisers because I am sure they tricked a lot of people into spending money and seeing those movies that year. The Hamiltons was easily the worst one of the ones I have seen the other ones I saw were Unrest, Dark Ride, and Reincarnation. The movie cover and trailer made it seem like a family of cannibals terrorizing the neighborhood which I thought was a rather interesting plot, only to be disappointed at the end discovering that it was some coming of age tale about a boys transition into being a vampire. Which is why drama prevails over any sense of horror in this film. And to make the plot even more ridiculous, they add in a set of horny twins who cannot wait to take a bite out of one another, and some deadly creature locked in the basement, which if I had discovered what it was had the secret not been revealed at the very end of the film, I would have left the theater halfway into the movie.Complete waste of money and time. Cut forty minutes out of this film, and make it into an episode on some show like Smallville or Charmed or Supernatural and it would have received more praise than this. Absolute rubbish! So bad that two years later, I have to come back to IMDb and write a review about it because it still stands out in my memory as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Also, while you are reading this, steer clear from the rest of the Horrorfest movies in the future. The most you could do is rent them from Blockbusters or watch it online somewhere. Horrorfest features movies from independent filmmakers who cannot make it onto the big screen, and all the crap about stuff they do not show you in theaters, they were not referring to blood or guts, or horror...they were referring to the movies themselves.

The fact that his brothers  sister kidnap, imprison  murder people in the basement does not help relax or calm Francis nerves either.

Is that really supposed to scare us? Is that really supposed to shock us? Is that really something that is supposed to have us talking about it as the end credits roll? Is a harmless looking young boy the best twist ending that the makers could come up with? The boring plot plods along, it is never made clear where the Hamiltons get all their money from to buy new houses since none of them seem to work except David in a slaughterhouse  I doubt that pays much or why they have not been caught before now. The script tries to mix in every day drama with potent horror  it just does a terrible job of combining the two to the extent that neither aspect is memorable or effective. A really bad film that I am struggling to say anything good about.Despite being written  directed by the extreme sounding Butcher Brothers there is no gore here, there is a bit of blood splatter  a few scenes of girls chained up in a basement but nothing you could not do at home yourself with a bottle of tomato ketchup  a camcorder. The film is neither scary  since it is got a very middleclass suburban setting there is zero atmosphere or mood. There is a lesbian  suggest incestuous kiss but The Hamiltons is low on the exploitation scale  there is not much here for the horror crowd.Filmed in Petaluma in California this has that modern low budget look about it, it is not badly made but rather forgettable. The acting by an unknown to me cast is nothing to write home about  I cannot say I ever felt anything for anyone.The Hamiltons commits the cardinal sin of being both dull  boring from which it never recovers.

In fact, all of the acting is skin deep. Even though the darkhaired women appeal, the salaciousness is kept to a minimum. No nudity here. Also lacking are sufficient buckets of blood. All sensations are kept at a teasing, safe distance...an unfortunate fact considering the given name of the directors is butcher. Only the soundtrack, the droning angsty altcountry and the tense fluctuating score provide any palpable tension. Sometimes some static storyboarded compositions add appealing lowangles that adds to the malaise...but for a film that calls itself horror, I did not even get close to flinching once. Perhaps a greater emphasis on societal rejuvenation through blood intake, scenes directed with varying geometric shapes outside the square, and a sustained focus on playfulness through the familys maliciousness or traps sympathetic characters need to escape in order to escape their dilemma would have improved my opinion, but this was not a good start to my excursion through horrorfest.","label":0},{"index":7143,"txt":"The Return of Chandu is notable, if one can say that, for the casting of Bela Lugosi as the hero rather than the villain.

Fans of King Kong 1933 will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep Kong at bay in several scenes. The acting is for the most part, awful. The actor who plays the high priest I believe Lucien Prival for example, uses that acting coach inspired pronunciation that was so common in the early talkies. The less said about the others the better. It is a mystery why Lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career, because he was still a bankable star at Universal at this time.

As the beginning credits roll around I am surprised to discover this film was made under the Filmirage company. Filmirage brought the world such amazing stinkers as Troll 2, Ator the Invincible, and Quest for the Mighty Sword, so I was compelled to watch.As the movie started out it had potential to be pretty decent, even though it was unoriginal. The gore scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent. But after a while into the film, the pace started dragging and I found myself thinking Okay someone better get killed soon,or Someone better mutate. At the onset of this drag, when I was having these thoughts, though someone may have gotten killed or have mutated, however as noted, the gore and effects were not very good. What made matters worse was that the scene transitions were confusing; example first Dr. Houseman would be at the Zoo, then he would have a flash back about possibly killing someone, finally he would wake up in a cold sweat in bed making the audience ask Was he dreaming he was at the zoo?. Like the movies pace, these scene transitions got progressively worse.I could try to say the character development of Dr. Houseman was pretty good, but towards the end of the film, that is, once you have seen what the Doctor has metamorphosed into, hopefully you will laugh which really, is the only reason to see this movie at least once; this movie unintentionally runs like a longwinded joke.The costume of the um, thing that Doctor Houseman becomes can also be seen in Joe D Amatos Quest for the Mighty Sword, which was made in the same year.

When the university he works for threatens to cut funding, he decides to inject the antiaging serum into himself. As a result, Dr. Houseman spends the rest of the movie slowly turning into a lizard. And oh yes, watching the good doctor go through the process of becoming that lizard is a great joy. It really is so bad that it is good. Some of the lines are classic What WAS it? A nightmare...from the past!Many of the reviews that I have read for this point up how stupid and ridiculous the last five minutes of this movie are. I am just going to go ahead and spoil it the good doctor goes from being a shuffling halfman, halflizard thing to being what appears to be a man in a rejected Godzilla costume, when the police finally gun him down. In the final scene, some obnoxious kid is seen with a little pet lizard which he claims will never die, and the movies heroine, Sally Donnelly Catherine Baranov evidently decides that the little lizard is the final incarnation of Dr. Houseman. The camera then gives us a closeup of the lizards face; this is, I assume, the directors way of showing us that the lizard is EVIL. Yes, it is goofy, but I fell over laughing so I cannot complain.I watched this movie because it was a part of the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Megapack that I purchased.

Of course, I then realized that it was made in 1990, which almost propelled it down to a 4, but decided to keep it at the mediocre 5 that it is.Metamorphis does on a few occasions, seem like a good movie desperately trying to get out.

After thinking I had been watching for ninety minutes, I realized I would only been watching an hour. Special effects are not stellar, but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around that weakness.The lead, a mildly charismatic male that seems to be attempting a blended channeling of Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves, reminded me mostly of Matt Dillons character in Wild Things. The female heroine does an OK job, but does not distinguish herself in anyway. There is a naughty girl role in here, and the actress does what she can with it, but it does not seem like much. There is a child actor that the director cannot decide if he is morose, cheerful or just weird. Pacing, as I said, is the worst problem with this movie, until a final battle with the bad guy that would make a Power Ranger blush.

There are a handful of nasty murders, cheesy monster effects and naked female bodies a guest appearance by sleazequeen Laura Gemser! on display, but it is mainly a talkative movie. The handsome  eloquent Dr. Houseman is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough with his research on human DNA codes when suddenly the university he works for threatens to cancel his funds. He developed a theory to decode genes and block the human ageing process, but if he does not come up with detailed reports any time soon, his research will be stopped. So Dr. Houseman does what any intelligent scientist would do and injects the untested serum into his own veins. Needless to say and like the title implies, he slowly turns into murderous monster that actually ages much quicker! In other words, his research sucked! Like the other reviewers already mentioned, this movie borrows a lot of ideas from David Cronenbergs The Fly \u0096 the dramatic romance sub plot included  but does not add any originality from its own. The big difference is that you constantly feel connected with Jeff Goldblums character in The Fly, whereas Dr. Houseman becomes just another monster that needs to be destroyed as fast as possible. The rapidageingsyndrome aspect also reminded me of Ruggero Deodatos sadly underrated giallo Phantom of Death, only the protagonist in that film inherited the disease and did not inflict it on himself.

No, wait  in fact, the friend is dead and it is his dad that is in trouble.

Desperate for help, the father talks to Sarge, the leader of Joeys old unit from Vietnam, when Sarge shows up for the funeral.Well, the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and the old gang saddles up for the city. You can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the movie.The one thing that drove me crazy is that Sarge keeps haranguing his men about planning, and about how they are really good at what they do when they plan ahead. But Joey would not have been put in a wheelchair by a gunshot in Vietnam in the first place if the unit had not been messing around! Then when things are going really well in the city as they battle the gangs, they do it again. For no reason at all, they completely bypass their plan and try to nail the gang without everyone being present. Phh!!!! I raise my hands in disgust.

Cause Rudd does not overact, and does not try so hard. The scenes with him and MintzPlasse are watchable. But the rest of the film is so stupid, it picks up at times.

It is no surprise, then, that this film is both wellmade, wellacted, and manages to sustain that distinctively different Spanish atmosphere. But it is also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to see.What actually is the purpose of all this? We have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree, despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voiceover are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal. In a routinely unpleasant opening sequence, set more than a decade earlier, we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and controlfreakery \u0085if I cannot have you nobody can\u0085.. Oddly enough, that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film, but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree, which appears completely different in both motivation and execution. What happened to him in jail to cause this change? We have no idea, though we do later discover, as an absurd sort of afterthought, that he obtained a law degree while imprisoned.In Britain, in several of our notorious serial killer or sex killer cases, the terrible question arises; what about the wife? Did she know, or suspect what was going on? This is a question that this film could have asked, and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters. But banally, the answer to the question is quite clearly No, she did not. Even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate, the film still manages to bungle it. All we actually get, sketched perfunctorily out at the end, is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event. Compare this to the awful revelatory moment in Ten Rillington Place, where Christies wife says you know what I mean\u0085. thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror.Major spoiler in this paragraph. In the meantime, we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police, thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again. How exactly did he achieve this? The plot gets extremely sketchy at this point; something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police; but how this all works or why, or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds, remains a mystery.I actually do not believe serial killers are like this. The Silence of the Lambs may be comic book stuff, but \u0096 Lecter aside \u0096 it gets its serial killers right. They are deeply disturbed, deeply dysfunctional, deeply inadequate people; not the creepily charming mastermind presented here closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of The Last Horror Movie, or indeed even Man Bites Dog, though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire.This film has little suspense, and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated. It has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers, either generally, or in the specific cultural milieu of Spain. This is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women. And oddly, what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented. The soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory. Just one explicit shot, properly timed, would have been infinitely more shocking, and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary, freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation. Instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear. Very, very creepy. I am sorry to be rude; I love horror films, and can tolerate even the most extreme, to the extent even of worrying my partner. But I think anyone who finds this film good, or interesting, even I would find myself edging away from. The purpose of a horror film is to scare you; this is just lascivious.It leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed. I have to give this film more than one star just because it is competently executed, but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made.","label":0},{"index":7227,"txt":"Visually speaking, this film is stunning.

Noone claims to have heard of it but it is definitely there  the family decide to take a detour in order to check it out  take some pictures. Once at the town they take some pictures  have a look around but when it comes time to leave their car will not start  they have to spend the night there. While looking around they find a camcorder videotape which they play only to discover footage of a scared woman saying all her friends have disappeared, the next morning  their car has disappeared as things take a very sinister turn. What is Weavers secret? Will the Henleys ever leave there alive...Written, coexecutive produced  directed by Walter Klenhard I have to say that Disappearance is one of the most frustrating films I have ever watched. For the first 85 minutes it was a pretty good mysterious mix of thriller  horror film but then we are treated to one of the single worst endings ever in motion picture history. The script suggest lots of different things but never elaborates or confirms  I was sitting there genuinely intrigued about what was going on, from the families car mysterious disappearing, the four recent graves, the thing in the abandoned mines, the supernatural sandstorm, the sudden  unexplained disappearance of Ethan  his just as unexplained reappearance, the Sheriffs sinister motives, the compass in the car going crazy, the crashed plane, the townspeople denying Weaver existed  the possible side effects of a neutron bomb being dropped near Weaver in the 40s but they are all tossed out of the window  for all we know could have been totally separate random events. Everything was coming along nicely  was set up for a big twist revelation but none was forthcoming  instead I was treated to the most ambiguous, strange, surreal  downright frustrating ending possible. If nothing else the ending contradicts much of what has gone before  leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. It is almost as if the makers had these great ideas but then did not know what to do with them  just made the ending up on the spot. I just felt I put so much effort into watching the film which can be pretty slow at times without any sort of reward  in fact the ending felt more like a kick in the teeth or a good two finger salute!Director Klenhard does a reasonable job here, the old ghost town has a certain atmosphere  the large expansive desert locations give a good sense of isolation. It is well made but what were they thinking with that ending? Nothing fits, nothing makes sense  it is just a huge frustrating mess that after sitting through the thing for nearly an hour  a half leaves you confused  wanting to know more. Despite being a horror film there is no blood or gore although there are one or two creepy moments here  there. The film actually reminds of The Hills Have Eyes 2006 remake for large parts as that is what the film is setup to be before a bizarre ending which does nothing to bring any closure to the film.Technically the film is good with high production values, good special effects, sets, locations  cinematography. Set in America but filmed in South Australia. The acting is fine from a decent cast.Disappearance is a really odd film, for a long time it shapes up to be a neat little horror mystery thriller but it never explains anything which happens  the truly surreal ending just throws up more questions than answers.

Cube, Spielbergs Duel and The Birds are all great examples of movies that give no answers but nonetheless leave us intrigued and wanting more. Apparently, Disappearance writerdirector Walter Klenhard was trying to make just that kind of film, and whether or not he succeeded is up to the viewer. I personally think he got about half way there, then the film just sunk.The actors are all kind of just hohum. Their not especially bad but we as an audience never really feel their fear and they react to situations in unrealistic ways. Is anyone else absolutely SICK of characters just walking out off to investigate strange sounds?!?!? At least give them SOME kind of justification for doing so!?!?!?As far as madeforTV films go it is an above average fair for sure. Director Klenhard Should be commended for really milking the desert environment for everything it offered and some of the setting were striking.

The town of Weaver seems harmless at first and has tourist appeal until the family is stranded there overnight and they begin to have good reason to suspect that others have experienced their same predicament with fatal outcomes. The Henleys watch a BlairWitchProjectesquire video diary left by the towns last victim, which ironically demonstrates the best performance of anyone in this movie. Although Hamlin and Deys performances are much better than the supporting casts, their emotional affect seems flat to me throughout the movie. Disappearance has appeal for most of the movie as there is much suspense and good direction. However, the plot takes unexpected and implausible turns that seemingly make no sense. Worse yet it that there really is no understanding of what exactly is going on in the movie, which makes the bizarre ending less tolerable. It appeared to me that the movie makers were so focused on making a stream of suspenseful scenes, that they threw away all the elements of good story making plot development, gradual explanation of themes and symbols that lead to a cohesive solutionoutcome. The most difficult aspect of the movie for me was that the first threequarter of it was spent building up tension and curiosity about certain aspects of the plot that were then suddenly disposed of as if we did not deserve an explanation What was the significance of the Indian symbols on the walls? What happened to the original people of Weaver? What was the connection with the people at the dinner? What did the Sheriff know? What did the missing boy discover if anything?This was, I believe, a bad move, since it engendered some resentment. I had invested quite a bit of brainpower into hypothesizing some plausible explanations for some of these plot turns and strange events, only to have the movie makers simply end it without giving an answer to any of these things. These are some nice cliffhangers for the ending of a miniseries that is about to pickup again next week, but a totally frustrating and inappropriate ending for a standalone movie.","label":0},{"index":7250,"txt":"No, this is nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach, fairy godmother and the glass slippers, but if I were to elaborate, I would have to spoil it for you, which I will not. But do not let curiosity get the better of you, as this movie is not fantastic. It is one of those movies that start off promisingly, before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent storyline. And that is real horror.Yoonhee To JiWon and Hyunsoo Shin Sekyeong are your ideal mother and daughter. Ones a successful plastic surgeon, while the other your dutiful, obedient, and beautiful teenage daughter. Their relationship is like hand in glove, so close you would think of them more as siblings rather than parentchild. But things start to go wrong do not they always when Hyunsoos friends, whom Yoonhee has operated on, start to go berserk.Perhaps it is a warning to audiences, and for those Koreans ladies who do not bat an eyelid when going under the knife, if news reports are to be believed. The only truly scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery, though somehow, I thought Kim Kiduks Time actually had more gore when featuring and describing what goes on during the surgery itself.It is a tale of two halves, the fist being an attempt to shock audiences with standard scare tactics, which, I admit, did get to me now and then. However, the second half degenerated the movie into mindless mumbojumbo melodramatics, and was quite contrived into its forcing its ideas down your throat. Some things begin not to make sense, and while attempts are always presented to explain, you probably will not buy it, not that horror movies are logical to begin with.The leads are all beautiful, and there is a distinct lack of male presence besides the negligible cop role.

And he was too.Unfortunately that is the only redeeming quality of the film. The rest is as unAustenlike as possible.Miss Elliot would NEVER have run through the streets of Bath like this. It was not in her character and it just was not done by a lady of the those times. The Anne Elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity. There are other painful anachronisms but this was the worst.Although there are 3 important quotes from the book, they are at entirely inappropriate moments, warning those who know the book that yet another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed.And although this version is not much shorter than the other one, it feels like everything is rushed. Very little care was taken to introduce the characters, show their dispositions and motives. Important scenes were omitted. How could they possibly have butchered the final scenes in this way ?

Having reserved a special slot for it last night, I sat down to watch it with my daughter aged 17 and a Film Studies student, with chocolates of course, in eager anticipation. We love Jane Austin.After just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk. The shaky camera shots and angles, general poor cinematography, direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied. Despondent, we viewed on.Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, looked oddly and with no particular purpose, directly at the camera on several occasions, breaking our hardwon fantasy of the moment and engaging us directly in an almost I will find you stalking fashion.Poor Rupert PenryJones, who played Captain Wentworth, did his best with the script and direction, bless him. I hope they paid him well, however, as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall, drenching him and his coactor. They were nearly swept out to sea. Health and Safety would have had a field day! Poor Rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line. Presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a reshoot of this scene. Anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place.Other than Mr. PenryJones, Alice Krige gave the only convincing performance as Lady Russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of Anthony Heads unconvincing portrayal of annoying Sir Walter Elliott.Towards the longawaited end of the film, Captain Wentworth appeared to oddly grace Anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie. It was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being. In contrast, Anne ran, hyperventilating, from pillar to post in search of the good Captain who, in the meantime, had managed to call upon almost the entirety of Bath we are told, in the course of only three or four minutes, without even having worked up a sweat.We experienced none of Annes charms crossing the screen. Indeed, we were left wondering what charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen in plain, spineless, opinionless Anne and why someone, anyone, did not tell mean, winging Sir Walter to just shut the heck up.The crucial kiss, normally our favourite girlie moment, was painfully drawn out. As they moved in closer, Anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met. Eww! The most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been.What a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story, filmed in some of Englands finest scenery.Sorry Jane.","label":0},{"index":7259,"txt":"This production never really got off the ground for me. The plot is so cut up as to be disjointed and the production is so short that unless you have read the novel or seen a better adaptation like the 1995 one with Amanda Root you are going to be a bit lost since there is no time for character development.I liked Sally Hawkins as Anne, but the rest of the cast fell rather short of what they should have been. Mrs. Croft was far too old, as was Annes elder sister Elizabeth. Mary uttered everything in such throbbing accents that the general peevishness and selfishness of her character was lost. Much better was Sophie Thompsons Mary, whose selfishness and sense of illusage is so well established that by the time Wentworth suggests Anne stay with the injured Louisa and Mary objects that she, as Louisas sister in law, should stay instead, you cannot imagine anyone less suited to do so. In this version, she might as well stay as she is insufficiently differentiated from anyone else in the production.Rupert PenryJones is nice to look at, but he made a much better St. John Rivers 1995 Jane Eyre, probably because that character required less implied depth of feeling. I agree with the comments made earlier about the gig scene seemed more like he was trying to get rid of Anne than do her a favor. Likewise the accident scene it happens so fast and with so little context, you wonder what all the fuss is about. And moving the speech that Wentworth overhears in the novel to the beginning of this production is a critical misstep that only contributes to the disjointed nature of the script. My other problem with this version was the lighting. Sometimes everything looked like a scene from the CSI morgue  very very blue. Other times the lighting was so bad it was hard to make out the scene very well, like when Anne visits her old school friend, Mrs. Smith who, by the way, is supposed to be more or less paralyzed. Having her run up to Anne on the street to tell her of Mr. Elliots awful character was such a violation that for a minute I could not think who she was  I thought she was one of the Musgrove girls. And she might as well have been. All the girls were pretty much interchangeable. And the running scene at the end...in an era where propriety was at a premium, it is hard to imagine gentle Anne tearing all over Bath like some demented hoyden. How silly can you get? It is too bad. Sally Hawkins had all the makings of a good Anne Elliot, but she was completely hamstrung by a poorly organized script and an overtruncated production.","label":0},{"index":7260,"txt":"Somewhere, on this site, someone wrote that to get the best version of the works of Jane Austen, one should simply read them. I agree with that. However, we love adaptations of great literature and the current writers strike brings to mind that without good writers, it is hard for actors to bring their roles to life. The current version of Jane Austens PERSUASION shows us what happens when you do not have a good foundation in a wellwritten adaptation. This version does not compare to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which was well acted and kept the essence of the era and the constraints on the characters with the exception of the bizarre parade  kissing in the street scene in Bath. The 2007 version shows a twitty Anne who seems angstridden. The other characters were not very developed which is a crime, considering how Austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen understatements. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel were completely tossed about, and Mrs. Smith, Annes bedridden and impoverished schoolmate is walking around in Bath   twittering away, as many of the characters seemed to do. The strength of character and the intelligence of Captain Wentworth, which caused Anne to love him in the first place, did not seem to be written into the Rupert PenryJones Wentworth. Ciaran Hinds had more substance and was able to convey so much more with a look, than PJ was able to do with his poses. All in all, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seemed to reduce the novel into a hand wringing, costumed melodrama of debatable worth. If they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances into Austens work, they should have done what they do with adaptations of Shakespeare adapt it to the present. At least Bride  Prejudice was taken out of the historical  locational settings and was fun to watch, as was Clueless. This was not PERSUASION, but they did not know what else to call it.","label":0},{"index":7261,"txt":"I am a huge Jane Austen fan and I ordered the movie from Amazon.UK just so I could see it without waiting forever for it to come to the U.S. I really should have saved my money. What is with Anne running after Wentworth? The whole point of Anne Elliots character is that she was quiet and refined. She is not impulsive and vulgar. And Mary, was she suffering from a stroke or something? Her speech was not normal, nor was her walking normal. There was no chemistry between the two main characters which made their whole romance completely unbelievable. In the final scene they even have Sally Hawkins wearing the same dress Amanda Root wore during the letter scene. The same clothes do not make it the same movie. In my opinion they did not watch the 1995 version, which even though it had it is flaws, it did stay pretty close to the book. The book, I do not even think they read it. This is kind of like a Cliffs Notes movie of Persuasion. Hit on all the high points without explaining anything.","label":0},{"index":7262,"txt":"I have no idea why they made this version of Persuasion when they already had that fine miniseries with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I suppose that they wanted to make a featurelength version, but of course a lot had to be deleted; alas, what ended up on the cuttingroom floor was all the lovely wit and humour, leaving a film that was mere melodrama rather than an amusing exposition of English country manners and mores.Also, the characters were shallow and uninteresting. They had poor Anne chasing up and down the streets after Captain Wentworth like a silly modern adolescent and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this, let me tell you running after a male like a female in heat is NOT cool. That is something a wellbred woman of the Napoleonic era would never have done, and certainly not this levelheaded heroine.Some have said they found this antic laughable; my reaction was not laughter, but outrage. The very idea of such a corruption of an Austen work is beneath contempt.It was ghastly.","label":0},{"index":7263,"txt":"My God, was this the Run, Lola, Run adaptation of Persuasion? It was horrible. Bad enough that the screenwriter and I use the term very loosely cut and pasted dialogue from one character onto another, often completely out of context and to rush the story along but Anne Elliott running from location to location in pursuit of Wentworth near the end of the piece was an abomination! Austen must be spinning in her grave. No respectable young woman would have acted in such an atrocious fashion. And the actress that played Mary? Horrors. Needless to say, if the rest of the Austen remakes are this bad, they will be turning off a new generation of watchers.If you want to see an impeccable version of this otherwise wonderful novel, get the 1995 Roger Michell directed version starring Amanda Root whose expressions alone can speak volumes and Ciaran Hinds. It is superb.","label":0},{"index":7264,"txt":"I love Jane Austens stories. I have only read two of them PP and SS, but after having seen this adaption, I am reaching for Persuasion from my bookcase just to make sense out of the story, and also, because I refusing to believe Jane Austen could have written such nonsense. For me, I thought that if you base a film on a Jane Austen novel, you cannot really go wrong. It will turn out great pretty much by default. I was wrong.First of all, where are the characters that you sympathise with and like? You have to have at least one likable character to get the audience to invest their emotions in them, and this did not deliver. Sure, I wanted Anne and Wentworth to get together, but only because that is what you know the purpose of the story is, them getting together. Instead, I had to resist urges to throw my teacup at the TV and to continue watching it to the end.Anne was utterly annoying throughout, and in the end, I really have no idea why Wentworth was so smitten by her, as there seemed to be nothing there for him to be attracted to. She was meek, bland, dull, socially inadequate and came across like a sheep following everyone elses instructions rather than having a mind of her own. This can still work for a lead character, if you do it well. This was not done well.The other characters were just displaying various degrees of narcissism, of which Mary was the worst, with a fullblown narcissistic personality disorder. Where Mrs. Bennet in PP had similar flaws, she was still endearing, whereas Mary was more of a freakshow. More loathsome than funny.Wentworth was very handsome and seemed like a decent kind of guy. For the most part of the story, I was just wondering what kind of person he was and why he is in love with Anne, as surely, he is the kind of guy who would want a person who is a little bit more... alive? Actingwise, not too much to say, as I reacted more to the characters being portrayed rather than how goodbad the people acting were. Anthony Head was excellent, but as soon as I saw he was in it, I expected no less.Also found the story very confusing. It was not until the end of the movie where it seemed as if Elizabeth was not Annes stepmother, but in fact a sister I am still not 100 on that. The whole AnneWentworth back story was also a bit fuzzy. They had been together but then broke up and they are both bitter about it? How come? I was wondering this for quite some time, and the explanation seemed to be she dumped him because she was persuaded to do so by someone? But it was said in a kind of by the by way that it was almost missed, as if it was somehow unimportant. How can it be unimportant when it is the very core of the story?? There was also a lot of namedropping, but no real feel for who the characters were. This Louisa person for instance, who was she? A friend? Family? What? It was not made very clear who the different characters are and their relationship with one another. Lady Russell was there a lot, but why? Mrs. Croft and Wentworth were brother and sister, which felt very unrealistic as Mrs. Croft looked old enough to be his mother.The final kiss, yes it was a bit strange them kissing in the street, but I did not really think about it, because I was too busy yelling GET ON WITH IT ALREADY!! at the TV, because Annes lips trembled and trembled and trembled for what felt like ages before they actually met Wentworths. Have SOME hesitation there, but only for a couple of seconds or so, not half a minute.Then there is the issue of camera work. As a regular movie watcher, you do not pay attention to angles and such unless you decide to look out for it. I did not decide to do so here, but I still noticed them. To me, that means the filmmakers are not doing a good job. A lot of conversations were with extreme facial closeups, something that should only be used when there is a really important point to be made. In this adaption, it was overused and therefore lacked meaning. The handheld feeling on occasion also did not really work in a period drama. The camera work in the running scene in the end also felt too contemporary. Not to mention the running itself. This was the only Austen adaption I caught in ITVs Austen season. Makes me wonder if it is worth watching Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park or if I should just read the books and leave it at that. I am sad to say, this is a Jane Austen adaption I did not enjoy. Maybe I will watch the 1995 version instead. The BBC are renowned for having done beautiful Austen adaptations before, after all.","label":0},{"index":7265,"txt":"I never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely to the novel especially a beloved one, like Evening but when I saw that the books author, Susan Minot, was a screenplay writer and executive producer on the film, I thought that Evening would be a good adaptation.If you enjoyed the book, do not bother with this movie. It is so far afield of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one another.Here, our characters are completely different the bride is in love with Harris. Harris is the son of the housekeeper. Buddy is a drunk, in love with Ann andor Harris. I do not think a single character made it from the book to the screen; oh it just gets worst with every passing moment.And, really, did not we learn from Bridges of Madison County that cutting from the story we are meant to be enthralled in, to scenes of our heroes grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights, simply does not work on film?

Part of the film is take up with shots of Annes face while she breaths deeply, and violin music plays in the background. the other part is filled with poor and wooden acting. Rupert Penry Jones is expressionless. Jennifer Higham plays Annes younger sister with modern mannerisms. Anne is portrayed as being meek and self effacing, which is fine at the beginning, but she stays the same all through the film, and you see no reason for captain Wentworth to fall in love with her. Overall the production lacks any sense of period, with too many mistakes to be overlooked, such as running out of the concert, kissing in the street, running about in the streets with no hat on why was this scene in the film at all? the scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written..

Meanwhile, her mother Janet Laila Morse is aware of Rays son, Billy Charlie CreedMiles and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails. The film follows these despairable characters as they tredge along with their lives.It is said that the British seem to enjoy being miserable, and that would include watching films that entertain them this way. Films like Nil by Mouth highlight this. It is a tale of a broken family, torn apart by crime, poverty, booze and drugs, the kind Jeremy Kyle would lap up like a three course meal. It is also essentially a tale of self destructive men, three generations apart and each copying the other, tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together, despite not being strong enough. If you pick up a little of what it is about from the offset, you can see it does not promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly does not disappoint in this.It is true what everyone said about the performances, and the lead stars, Winstone and Burke, do deliver some great acting. We see Winstone lose it with his wife, beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia, breaking down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid. Likewise, in a private moment, we see Burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase, the full impact of the night before kicking in.This is another of those films where there is no plot to follow, as such, just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next. It is been acclaimed by many including the Baftas! but it really was just too grim and bleak for me. I have no right to criticize it for this, knowing what I knew about it from the offset, but sadly this is how I found it.

Gary Oldmans semiautobiographical account of life lived on a South East London estate is a violent, Beckettian account of one of Dantes circles of hell, frankly. At the centre of it is Ray Winstone, who has done this sort of character before but never as well. The film opens with him ordering drinks at a pub bar  that is all  and you are already gripped with a sense of the frustration, selfloathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the course of the movie. It is an acting masterclass.Of course the stymied and dispossessed need a foil in a drama such as this and Winstone is matched by Kathy Burke as his longsuffering wife, who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behaviour. Charlie CreedMiles does an able turn as the fuselighting druggie son Billy although he must have wondered sometimes exactly what he let himself in for. Gary Oldman directs close up on the actors, maximising the claustrophobia of their council flat squalor. 410","label":0},{"index":7269,"txt":"I picked up this video after reading the text on the box, the story seemed good, and it had Keanu Reeves!

Before the home video revolution, it might not even have been released theatrically though it might have; after all, Plan 9 From Outer Space played in theaters. There is precisely one good and competentlydelivered line in the entire movie; I assume they stole it from somewhere.The acting is among the worst I have ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had a couple of competent actors, and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy, which can be fun to watch. Anyway, most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate. Here, those who do not read their lines like cigarstore Indians sound like they learned them phonetically. And this film does have one distinction it manages to be badly underplotted for most of the movie, then laughably overplotted for the ending.Update I should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception. She is by no means wooden. Not that she is good, but she certainly is not wooden.Even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few Puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness, but with this one, there does not even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about.And you know the funniest thing?

The film has decent camera work and editing, which is way more than I can say for many more extremely obscure slasher films.The film does not deliver on the onscreen deaths, there is one death where you see his pruning saw rip into a neck, but all other deaths are hardly interesting. But the lack of onscreen graphic violence does not mean this is not a slasher film, just a bad one.The film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously. The film came in at the end of the second slasher cycle, so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements, done in a tongue in cheek way. For example, after a kill, Charlie goes to the towns welcome sign and marks the population down one less. This is something that can only get a laugh.If you are into slasher films, definitely give this film a watch.

It seemed to be an old Raj Kanwar movie which disgusted me even before I started watching it because I do not consider him even close to being mediocre as a filmmaker. The only reason I took this one is obviously the Shahrukh Khan appearance in the film. I had not even known what the film was all about because I was sure it would be just an ordinary fairy tale. So I just imagined a love story between Shahrukh Khan and Divya Bharti with a substantial supporting role by Rishi Kapoor who I thought would be playing her father or uncle. And to my complete shock, Rishi Kapoor is actually the hero! He is the one who romances the young Divya! I was saddened to find out that Shahrukh had a small part of no substance and that too, only in the second part of this idiotic film.Just let me repeat the question why would a 17 yearold lovely Divya have fallen for a 40plus long haired, chubby, swollen piglet like Rishi Kapoor? Rishi Kapoor should be ashamed of taking this part; the only thing he did is ridiculing himself. He romanced a girl who could logically be younger than his own daughter and to make things worse  acts like a teenager at his forties. On top of that, just to make himself more pathetic, he plays a popstar...To make things clear, I have no problems with actors romancing ladies much younger than they themselves are. As long as they make a convincing couple, there should be no problem. In fact, leading actors have always been cast opposite young girls Amitabh BachchanSridevi, Mithun ChakrabortyMadhuri Dixit, Shahrukh KhanDeepika, Salman KhanSneha Ullal and made the pairing pretty well. Also, I have nothing against Rishi Kapoor, I think he is a good actor, and his act in Bobby is still wellengraved in my heart, but it is not that he looks in this film like, say, Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan or Aamir Khan look today.That was such a disappointment. Oh, and as for the reason every person actually watched this film, Shahrukh Khan made a good debut. He excelled in the very little his part allowed him to do.

I know better than to demote the value of a movie just because it was not a faithful adaptation. There is a lengthy process and lots of decisions that go into making a movie that are sometimes out of the directorseditorscinematographersproducers control and certainly out of the original authors control. Therefore, it is unreasonable to expect a movie to be exactly the same, word for word, as a book or play or video game or Disneyland Ride, or whatever! A movie should be judged on its own standard and how it fits in society. Moreover, a successful movie should be made because the material is relevant to the society which it belongs and, if it is based on source material, its relevance needs to be reexamined and enhanced by the filmmakers. Films like There Will Be Blood follow this paradigm because while it was based on a novel written at the turn of the century, Oil!, it feels relevant because of things like the Iraq war and energy concerns that the films country of origin, the US, was and is experiencing. Even King Kong, based on the original film, benefits from using new technology and concerns of animal rights that people have.With that said, I just do not understand why they even bothered to make this movie? Besides the great performances, guaranteed Oscar nods and Shanleys directorwriters fee and royalties he will get, this movie seems to come from nowhere. It should have simply stayed as a play. The movie which is essentially the same as the play says nothing new about the reprehensible sexual atrocities committed and in many cases covered up by the Catholic church here and abroad. It says nothing new or different than the original play. I cannot help but compare this movie to another movie that came out at around the same time FrostNixon, which was also based on a play. FrostNixon, while about Nixons regrets, seems relevant because it seems to have come at a time when President Bush was about to leave office. The regrets that Nixon had, as depicted in the playmovie, about the war and his presidency could just as easily reflected on Bush and his presidency. In that respect FrostNixon seemed more relevant and actually benefited from a wider distribution via film because it got people talking and reflecting about the political status quo in the country at the time. In contrast, Doubt felt like it was yesterdays news and did not seem to offer anything that the play did not offer.Of course the movie is good, the performances are outstanding, and the screenplay adaptation is apt, but so what? Why did not it just stay as a play? Why, besides marketing and financial reasons, make it into a movie? It gave audiences nothing new to discus about the awful subject.","label":0},{"index":7283,"txt":"The Oscar season has arrived so this means a slew of these deep, engaging, powerhouse ensemble films are all over the movie theaters in hopes of gaining an audience and having the opportunity to earn Best Picture in the big show. Among them is this film that is based off a very popular and wellacclaimed play. The original playwright was actually the writer and director of the film adaptation; which comes as a doubleedged sword. On one hand, who better to translate the play than the original writer? On the other hand, who better to not see the mistakes and drawbacks of the play and fix upon them than the original writer himself? Doubt mixes excellent acting and plenty of tension and suspense; with a frustrating ending, unnecessary dialogue, questionable directing, and of course, the inability to provide substantial answers. It is a growing trend among these highcaliber films to not answer all questions it provides, and this has to stop.Doubt is like a joke without its punch line, like a book with the final 20 pages missing, like losing reception while watching the fourth quarter of a hotly contested football game, and like not having the 50 cents to continue playing the arcade game and see what happens next. Doubt, just like the previous Best Picture frustrationfest No Country For Old Men, does not really end; it does not provide us with considerable answers nor does it deliver enough for us to figure out the ending. Yes, that was the intent, but this is not a test of humanity, it is a copout. I do not pay money to see an unfinished work, I pay money to see a beginning, middle, and end, and pray that I do not fall asleep during the three acts. We are forced to become the writers of the movie by filling in the blank ourselves as to what happened before and what will happen to the characters we saw screaming at each other.This little drama is about a nun Meryl Streep who seems very sure that the wellbeloved priest Philip Seymour Hoffman is making sexual advances towards a child that goes to the church; the first AfricanAmerican boy in the Catholic church. The church is secretly torn as to whether or not he really is committing heinous sins behind everyones backs. The plot thickens as some of the kids begin behaving differently, which attracts the notice of a young teacher Amy Adams. The story is set right after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, which shook the nation for quite some time and questioned their faith in humanity and in each other.Doubts strong points come in the acting ensemble and also the everengaging suspense that builds slowly and never boils over. Streep seems to be Oscarworthy in every role she is in, and here she is no different as her sternness and coldhearted behavior places a blanket of fear in all the students and with some of the staff in the church. Hoffman excels yet again as the priest, by successfully meshing suspicion with a charming personality and a friendly aura. The seemingly hypocritical personality is tough to pull off, especially when we are suppose to like him and also ponder about him at the same time; but Hoffman steps up to the plate against one of the best actresses of our generation and fantastically delivers. When these two argue, you can hear the fireworks fly without ever seeing one launched. But let us not forget Amy Adams Enchanted and Viola Davis Law ad Order for their superb job either. Doubts casting ensemble is among the best in 2008.Yet, like previously stated it is the writing and directing that ruins this film, especially when dwindling down the third act. Questions pop up, but they are not answered. Characters pop up, but provide no real enhancement towards the plot. Kids behave different, but we never truly find out why. There are awkward angles in the camerawork\u0085and\u0085there is no actual reason why. John Patrick Shanley, the writer of the play, had one previous film in his directing repertoire Joe Versus the Volcano. Whether sheer arrogance or stupidity, we are stuck with seeing overdrawn sequences of random conversation, utter annoying chatter that bores to no end There was a two minute discussion about coffee and how much sugar the priest wanted thanks to Mr. Shanley.Bottom Line The lack of an ending is a stupid trend that is just as irritating as the seizureific camerawork in action films. It does not matter that we have a great talented acting cast, or decent cinematography, or a good story being worked upon, or good usage of sound and music; because we have a barrage of unanswered questions that sprinkles all over a film that is over 100 minutes yet does not even finish! The translation from play to film is good and quite accurate, because we have the original madmen behind the project\u0097but he took the mistakes and stupid hiccups from the play to the film as well. This decade has seen its share of blockbuster and highprofile films that could have gotten a much higher score from me if they had just decided to add a few more minutes of footage and actually end Sideways, Cast Away, No Country For Old Men, Burn After Reading are a few examples.Newsflash end your stinkin movie. Please or at least provide a good amount of clues for us to easily fill in the blank like WallEs depressing backstories, instead of staring into space as the credits suddenly start rolling and you are left with a feeling of emptiness, confusion, and mental anguish. Have a beginning, middle, and the end please!! As a critic, I prefer my films to be whole, not incomplete. Doubt feels incomplete, which is why it gets an incompetent grade.Someone has to break this stupid trend.","label":0},{"index":7284,"txt":"OK, I am blessed.

Way too much extraneous dialog, and waaay too many added scenes and people. Yes, the four major performances are quite good, esp. Ms. Streeps. But comparing stage to film is definitely an example of less is more. The thickening of the play to satisfy filmgoers need for scenic variety and specificity was a poor choice. Please, please, please go find a stage production somewhere near you.","label":0},{"index":7285,"txt":"What happened? Doubt had so much potential to be a brilliant film  but instead it faltered with a dragging simplistic plot line which made me want to stop watching. The only thing the film had going for it was the brilliance of Meryl Streep, who no DOUBT deserved the Oscarnomination. Though it was not one of her best performances, she still gave a solid and truthful character to us which blossomed through the screen.However, not even the brilliance of a screen legend could save this film from going down hill. From the boring start, which had no power or punch  to the less than convincing ending, the film was truly a disappointment  especially since it provided so much potential through its promotion and trailers. It was obvious the director had trouble with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring film, which dragged on for too long, with too much talk and not enough action.Furthermore, the other Oscarnominations were less than convincing. Though Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance, it was by no means Oscarworthy. Especially since they completely left out performances such as Will Smith, in Seven Pounds. Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination. Watching Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box  as it was one sided and plain. It would have made more sense to nominate her for a Razzie, as I am sure she would have walked away victorious. Viola Davis gave a short but truthful performance, but the length of her performance made me question whether the academy really should have given her the nomination.Overall, I consider Doubt to be one of the most disappointing films of 2008. It was a mess of a film with so much potential, and I do not recommend it. The only shining light in the film is Meryl Streep, who though gives a stunning, solid performance  does not even do enough to save this film.   10.","label":0},{"index":7286,"txt":"Nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing!

The acting, in fact, is what I feel steals the show. I did not recognize any of the actors in the movie, and I hope that I never have to see any of them again.

I think we were supposed to be sympathetic to her. Instead, she is completely unlikeable. The other great actresses do an OK job, but certainly do not light up the screen. Out of all the great actresses in this movie, I would say the one who did the best job was Natasha Richardson.

The actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded, the special effects are a joke, and the pace is insanely slow. To me though, the music tops it all.

But tonight there is going to be a jailbreak, and Kol flees on a convenientlyplaced escape pod and flies towards Earth which apparently is nearby. There he confronts a group of teenagers who look thirty and a game warden John Phillip Law, who help protect him from his worst nightmare... the bounty hunter and executioner android or more properly gynoid the Alienator.From the cover of the box, I was confident this was going to be an awful movie. But, as awful as it turned out to be, it was a ton of fun as well probably at least partially because I was watching it with someone who happens to be intensely awesome. The director Fred Olen Ray, who has specialized in making over one hundred lowgrade films most notably Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers, does what he does best and throws together a plot that only half makes sense and gives us rudimentary special effects. Bonus P.J. Soles appears as Tara, obviously at a low point in her career.Sure, there is plot holes. Why are there hillbilly rednecks in California allegedly Los Angeles County if I understood the warden correctly. What is up with the space womans tacky blouse? Why is there a subplot about the ship captain forcefully trying to win her heart when this story goes nowhere? What the heck is Quadrant 5? How does chicken wire create an electromagnetic field that will shortcircuit an android, yet land mines do virtually nothing? Why does Kol look like a drunk, Native American football player with emphysema? And the Lund guy Robert Clarke... does his character even have a point? Does the game he plays with the captain have a point? Does this movie have a point? But the biggest mystery is the android or gynoid the Alienator, played by Teagan Clive. What is an alienator? Why does it look like Daryl Hannah from Blade Runner, only much larger? Because, see, if something is a cyborg, it is part human. But if it is an android, it is all machine. This was an android, so there was no reason to make it look human. It could have looked like anything. Yet, the person who designed her made her the size of a linebacker, with David Bowies hair and a leotard that shows me just a little too much. If you are going to make a female android, would not the purpose be to have her be seductive and lure enemies in? Mission not accomplished. They say beauty comes in all shapes and sizes, but I think I found a huge exception.If Mystery Science Theater 3000 were still around today, this film would be on a very short list of movies that need to get harangued.Beyond the buttnasty Alienator sorry, Teagan, female weight lifters are gross the film is alright. Maybe there is not much of a story and maybe the characters are not really very interesting. And maybe the scene with the deer is incredibly adorable for no particular reason  what use does a killer robot have with a deer? But overall, I actually liked the movie.

All the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped. I also felt that the back and forth between the past and present was unnecessary. It seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the book the Da Vinci Code in which the device was used to increase suspense, or from The Notebook in which they used the device to create the never ending romance of the storys main characters.

Tom Ewell is a drunken agent, overplayed with so little comic ability you almost expect him to bellow hi honey, I am home! The blurb sites him as So funny in The 7 Year Itch. It sounds almost like an excuse. What other film would sell itself on the fact that a leading player was good in something else? It reads like So funny in The 7 Year Itch ... but he is rubbish in this.Mansfield, a beautiful girl with rumoured 50inch assets, is, unfortunately, a bargain basement Monroe with all the acting ability and comic timing of a rotting haddock. Her wooden delivery combined with Ewells OTT doubletakes make this a comedy partnership from Hell. For her part, the sell gives us Jayne Mansfield whose more obvious talents are the cause of many of the films biggest laughs! As you can see, a movie sold on the idea that it is lead has a big chest is not the most sophisticated of things. Most of this humour is men literally falling over themselves, their glasses cracking upon site of Mansfield, etc. Only the Freudian nightmare of a milk bottle overflowing casts doubt upon its U certificate.For the musical side, the most adenine of players are chosen. Would you really care to see Eddie Fontaine offer I love your eyes, I love your lips, they taste even better than potato chips in a song called Cool It, Baby?

In fact, with its reds that bleed and fakelooking flesh tones, it resembles a colorised movie. Direction, though, is not outstanding, and the sound quality is also quite poor.Perhaps it comes down to it being so old. A time when men still smoked on screen, sickeningly cute child actors made adult remarks and black servants only got to cook and dance. All of which happen here. Yet Some Like It Hot, The African Queen, Ben Hur and many, many more stand as examples of films from the period that can still be enjoyed today, so the good at the time argument does not really stand up.

He just did them because Colonel Parker had him tied down to long term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of Elvis as possible! I keep thinking thank God that Elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out. It is cool to see character actors Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this movie, though.Burgess Merediths indian makeup is absolutely AWFUL. It is The worst of the bunch for sure. What were the filmmakers thinking? Was Mr. Meredith doing this one just for the money or what? I do love certain Elvis movies, though. For example Love Me Tender, Jailhouse Rock, Viva Las Vegas. I can even stand to watch his movie with future TV costars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner,Change Of Habit in which Elvis plays an innercity doctor.Oh well, at least Elvis made a FEW good films, but the mediocre and bad ones overwhelm the decent and good ones.I will always love ELVIS!

Forgetting that it was a girlie film, I thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girlfriend would have told him that facefungus did not flatter him, but then I realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a beard because he looked worse without it.I kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery  if you are dragged along to it, see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head, just the sort of thing you would expect in a beach cottage.Apart from the obligatory wedding, there is only one piece of action.

The plot is chaotic and some of the acting and lines are dreadful.The film is a strange combination of sadomasochistic fantasy combined with a window of the brutality and immorality of the slavery and fails on all counts. It is as though Meyer was trying to make up for the sexploitation blackploitation by having a higher moral message. Meyer knows we feel a bit guilty about getting turned on by the blatant dominatrix connotations of the early scene showing Lady Susan wielding a whip in a provocative outfit. He then tries to steer back to the righteous path by turning it into a film about the triumph of good over evil. However, because they cancel each other out, you end up with nothing.Because it so bad in so many ways, it is actually worth watching if you appreciate the art of making an awful film in the worst possible taste. Perhaps, because it is so bad, we almost let Meyer get away with the unacceptable.","label":0},{"index":7329,"txt":"Made one year before ILSA, SHEWOLF OF THE SS, BLACKSNAKE could have easily been called SUSAN, SHEWOLF OF THE PLANTATION and it probably inspired the producers behind the Nazi sexploitation epics to go ahead with their more infamous films because the stories are identical a gorgeous, horny, head strong but stupid blonde woman degrades and kills many people under her control, whom all hate her and want her dead. Sounds familiar? Director Russ Meyer and David Friedman, the producer behind the ILSA flicks, are good friends and they started their careers together. So, obviously, there is a connection there. Looking at BLACKSNAKE, I cannot help but think that Russ Meyer wanted to move on and do something else than his typical busty women epics because XXX movies were all the rage during the mid 1970s, and Russ Meyer films, though filled with nudity and kinkiness and violence, were never even close to real porn. His films started to look positively quaint next to DEEP THROAT and other hardcore porno blockbusters. Meyer knew he could not compete with such films and BLACKSNAKE is sorta the end result of such a quandary in his career. He obviously wanted to branch out into different uncharted territory. But BLACKSNAKE bombed at the B.O. and Meyer quickly returned to making VIXEN type of films that, even if they still were not pornographic, they were most definitely more overthetop than any of his previous films.It is no wonder BLACKSNAKE was a B.O. failure. It is just terrible. Trashorama. Jawdroppingly bad. It is a quasicampy take on slavery, if you can imagine that. The end result is jarring. One minute, we are in typical Meyer territory exuberant, playful and silly, and then the next minute, super serious meditation on slavery and violence. Huh? It just does not work. The slaveryracism aspect is woefully mishandled and veers this movie in the true exploitation category. But BLACKSNAKE is not as sleazy as ILSA SHE WOLF OF THE SS and those kind of films, so I imagine fans of the latter were disappointed by it, which would explain the almost lack of interest in this movie from either exploitation fans or Russ Meyer fans. Meyer blames the failure of BLACKSNAKE because, and I quote, It did not have enough breasts in it. Well, I am sorry Russ, but the film is just bad, breast or no breasts. But he is right though about the low breast quota. Except for Anouska and the maid, the films cast is male. Meyer replaces his usual bevy of buxom babes with throng of hunks with massive pecs, in the form of anonymous black actors playing the slaves and the big David Darth Vader Prowse. And with Anouskas right hand man around, who is portrayed as a ruthless but clever gay man who enjoys the power he has over the men, one can only wonder what Meyer was really trying to create here.BLACKSNAKE stars David Warbeck, who is lusted after by Anouska and her right hand man. Poor David. He looks totally befuddled by the whole experience. He did seem to have fun making the movie but you can clearly see that, at times, he has no idea what is going on. And then there is Anouska Hempel. She is a beautiful woman...for the 1970s, not the 1870s. With her makeup and hair, she looks like a typical 1970s Brit pinup babe than a turn of the century dominatrix. And her wardrobe is hilarious. At one time, she actually unzips her leather boots! I did not know they had zippers in those days. But the character she plays is, in itself, really degrading no pun intended. She is nothing but a cipher to the object of lust and scorn of every men and that woman on the island. For example, one night, when David and Anouska are getting it on, her annoying slave driver walks in the room, knocks David unconscious and tries to rape her, groping her savagely. The next day, the slave driver is still working for Anouska and the two act as if nothing had happened. It is totally ludicrous. Under any circumstance, had her character been a real person, Anouska would have whipped the slave driver senseless and kicked his butt off the island. Or even killed him. But the fact that the woman keeps him on her plantation after he tried to rape her is stretching the flimsy story and characters credulity to the max.Ridiculous details like this, and the thoroughly startling blaxploitation angle makes BLACKSNAKE a strangely unpleasant but watchable movie. Watchable in the train wreck variety. I just could not help but watch the film for the utter baseless aspects of it all the excellent cinematography sorta makes it easier to watch. So, this being an exploitation film, I guess it succeeded in doing what it was supposed to do.

However, if you want to see a film about that, try Ed Zwicks flawed THE SIEGE instead, because NADA is one of the most infantile political thrillers ever made. Like Robert Altmans PRETAPORTER, the director has taken on a subject he seems completely ignorant of, and imprints his ignorance on almost every frame.His terrorists are a wildly unconvincing group of stereotypes  Fabio Testi dresses as if he were auditioning for MAD Magazines Spy vs. Spy strip, Michel Duchaussoy behaves like an absurd KIDS IN THE HALL send up of the sociology professor from Hell, Mariangela Melato a cardboard middleclass revolutionary wannabe  who behave at every unconvincing plot turn as if they want to be caught. The corrupt authorities fare a little better, but are still painted in unconvincingly broad strokes.It is possible to make a smart film about dumb people cf ELECTION, but this is a moronic film about dumb people made by people who think they are intellectuals who are talking down to the masses. In truth, were one to recast Testi, Duchaussoy and Melato with Jim Varney, Johnny Knoxville and Shannon Tweed, the result would actually be to raise the intellectual content of the film, not lower it.Chabrol might just have got away with his characters and events if he took them seriously, but his staging is so inept the fight scenes would embarrass a kindergarten class while the shooting of the kidnapping is more inept than the kidnapping itself and his inability to get his cast to perform with at least some approximation of recognisable human behaviour so blatant that it is actually embarrassing to watch special mention must be made here of Duchaussoy so very good in Chabrols QUE LA BETE MUERE, he is stunningly bad here in a performance that is so far over the top it is back again.Chabrol has made some fine films, but you would never guess it from this amateurish mess  a newcomer to his work would never want to see another of his films after this, which would be a great shame.

I thought maybe it was a fluke. So I set the DVR to tape the pilot and all other episodes.As I was watching the pilot, I just kept wondering how a show with such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot. The pilot is supposed to suck people in and keep them coming back for more. There is supposed to be excitement, flash, great writing, intriguing storyline with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season. Amazingly, this show had none of that.Thinking it was a fluke, I just watched the second episode hoping for the best.

But this is totally upstaged and wrecked by the neverending immoral relationships of the show is characters. Everybody seems to have slept with just about everyone, even during office hours, which is ridiculously unrealistic. There does not seem to be one solid, lasting marriage or relationship in the entire show  everyone is broken up and on the prowl  hardly a true reflection of all Americans. Indeed, there is a total lack of respect for marriage or monogamy and it is truly fulsome.Then we are presented with endless little moral dilemmas and they are generally solved in such a way that belittles anyone who does not agree with the allknowing degenerate management and staff of the private practice. For instance, in one of the latest episodes we are presented with an exceedingly rare situation of a baby who is born with an uncertain gender and Addison absolutely refuses to perform the surgery because we are supposed to let the baby decide his gender later on. Anyone who disagrees with this is portrayed as immature and stupid.And I think that anyone opposed to abortion would be offended by the way the show treats prolifers. Addison made the comment that no man was allowed to have an opinion on the issue and only one black character was given dignity for opposing abortion on moral grounds. The general feeling was that if you opposed abortion, you are a freak  hardly the popular sentiment in the US. Two of the main characters in the show nonchalantly mention that they had abortions when they were younger and had no apologies or regrets, in spite of the fact that research has shown women can undergo intense depression. What is more a young girl comes to the clinic for an abortion and then thanks the staff on the way out and someone talks about it as how they were helping this young person and it was like something to exult in.

Through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love. Her daughter Constance is older, more responsible, a mother of two and has things together. Nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life.First of all the good. The period detail in the movie is great. The dresses, hair, cars, houses, etc. really put you in another time and place. And there is some very quality acting in the movie. Vanessa Redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end. Claire Danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young and she is an outstanding singer. Hugh Dancy brought a lot of life to the character of Lilas brother Buddy.Now for the bad, which unfortunately is everything else. Things constantly disrupt the story as it is being unfolded for us. The chemistry between young Ann and Buddy is great. They have fun and dance. Then... you are supposed to believe that she does not really like him more than a friend and that his pining only annoys her. And I thought the whole, he might be gay thing was out of the blue and did not serve a purpose.Then we have Harris. The character acts wooden and creepy. Had this been another genre, you would have known that Harris was the serial killer from the get go. It is an unbelievable stretch to think that all these girls loved him so but they do portray the other guys as pretty lame to try and help him out.And the grandest problem of all.

That is a movie is supposed to be complete and without too long passages of boredom or waste of time. This movie is not. But I guess a lot of independent movies are about showing movie skills, and considering this, this movie has a few highlights. If I am to comment on what the directors should take with them to their next project, I guess the distorted sound effects had some quality. They also manage to build some characters, this however takes me to what they should leave out in their next project, because the character building takes too long, since it is mostly irrelevant for the movie plot. Neither should the long spaces of time dedicated to walking around be continued in the next project  whats the point? I guess this movie tries to be a little bit of everything building characters, suspense and a plot, and ends up being nothing not a lotThis movie tries too much and too hard, and I guess it should have been cut to a short film. I could easily manage to find one hour of walking around or pointless dialogue to cut from the movie.There is too much irrelevant things going on in this movie.

I say supposedly because the title of the movie does not have the V in brackets to indicate that it was a made for DVD movie even though it does have the appearance of one.The plot is simple \u0096 a band is holding a gig in a former meatpacking factory and they are killed one by one.I think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece, but this does not excuse the faults here. Even straighttoDVD movies such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE which has a very low IMDb rating have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the socalled so bad, they are good movies. However, THE CHOKE falls far short of being either a serious slasher such as HALLOWEEN or being a so bad it is good movie such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE.The movie does start off good with a character killed using a drill. The blood effects were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget. But, from there onwards, it is downhill all the way.There are so many faults in THE CHOKE that I could spend all day talking about them. But, a few obvious ones stand out and I will go into them.The aforementioned gig that the band holds seems to start off with around 50 people present but after the music stops, there seems to be only around 8 people left and yet they are all meant to be locked in!.The characters in this movie are not likable at all. Most of the band members are aggressive foulmouthed morons or just downright weird. No one really cares about what happens to them, and even their supposed friends forget about them when they have been dispatched. The highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meatpacking factory as some kind of church seriously!. He spouts some really funny lines for no apparent reason. But sadly, even his presence cannot save the movie.There are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterisation. Around 65 minutes of the film is spent watching characters walk around talking. Characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation. As in other straighttoDVD movies such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other aggressively without any provocation at all. There are plenty of overthetop outbursts mainly from the male characters and one nearly results in a fullblown fight. In fact, the format could be said to go as follows characters walk aroundmurder takes placecharacters walk aroundmurder takes place. You get the idea.The dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the fword being used. Perhaps this was meant to be funny, but it just comes off as sad. And more to the point, we have all seen this done a thousand times before usually to much greater effect.The movie is totally devoid of any suspense at all. The dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger. A maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like total morons. They make little attempt to get out of the factory or find a weapon with which to protect themselves. And much of the time, they do not even pretend to be scared.In the same vein as DRIVEIN MASSACRE, the killer is not seen at the time the murders are being committed with the exception of the final murder when the killers identity is revealed. A random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question. There is no one seen stalking the characters at any time. In DRIVEIN MASSACRE, this served to make the film funny unintentionally of course, but here it is not funny at all.And, as another reviewer has pointed out, the soundtrack includes music that is very bad, even for those who like punk rock. The extras look uncomfortable dancing to it. The score at the end, there is no music at the beginning! consists of a band of Sugarbabe wannabes singing some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the movie.Do not misunderstand the points made in this review. This reviewer likes bad movies such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE as much as the classics such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH. But, it seems that THE CHOKE tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into either. And even as straighttoDVD movies go, this is a poor effort.On a positive note, the film does contain some fairly good gory murder scenes. But, when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes lose their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion.Fans of the traditional 1980s Bmovie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie. And fans of the classics such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH should do everything in their power to avoid it!","label":0},{"index":7362,"txt":"The Choke starts as a rock band known as The Choke prepare for a gig at a nightclub called Club 905 owned  run by Guy Johnson Andrew Parker.

The script by Jessica Dolan  Susannah Lowber not too many horror films out there penned by ladies... has some surprisingly good characters in it  some nifty dialogue but while it is much better than a lot of modern shot on a camcorder type horror in that respect it is so slow  boring that even a few interesting characters cannot come anywhere close to saving it. As one would expect all the usual teen slasher clich\u00e9s are used, from the isolated location the victims cannot escape from, the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up, a few murders  a really poor twist ending that tries to mimic something like Scream 1996  be surprising but does not make a whole lot of sense when you think about it logically they could not have done some of the things they were supposed to  to make matters even worse I guessed who the killer was fairly early on  even though I do not want to boast I was spot on. Then there is the fact that the makers of The Choke felt that it is audience would be entertained by showing endless well it feels endless while watching it scenes of teenagers walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular, I am sorry but there is only so many scenes like this that I can take before it starts to become tedious. The kill count is low, at first they all decide to stick together good idea but then they all just randomly decide to split up  go their separate ways bad idea when there is a killer on the loose, the pace is lethargic, the kill scenes are unimaginative  to top it all off the twist ending is poor.Director Mas does alright, the film looks OK for the most part although there are the odd occasions where he uses some annoying post production editing technique like slow motion or frame skipping. The gore levels are not really up to scratch, there is some blood splatter, a guy with a hole in his chest, a few dead bodies  someone impaled on some metal poles. Most of the kills happen off screen with the axe kill at the end a good example of the film not actually showing anything. Since the film is about a rock band there is quite a rock orientated soundtrack with some truly horrible, horrible rock songs used on it. I am sorry rock fans but to my ears this crap is just noise pollution. It is not scary, there is no real atmosphere  the lack of blood  gore is just inexcusable when the rest of the film is so bad.With a supposed budget of about 1,000,000 The Choke is well made with reasonable production values, it looks cheap to be sure but not as cheap as many low budget horror films look. Shot in a place called Spokane in Washington apparently. The acting is one of the films strongest points as it is generally pretty good all round, I mean noone is going to win an Oscar but it as not half bad.The Choke is a throughly routine Scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever  a criminal lack of blood, gore, violence, nudity  dead bodies. I mean if a slasher has not got any sex or gore then what is the point? Those are the only things that the average slasher is worth watching for, right?","label":0},{"index":7363,"txt":"I watched this film not really expecting much, I got it in a pack of 5 films, all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect? and you know what I was right, they were all terrible, this movie has a few and a few is stretching it interesting points, the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, i.e damned annoying and, well thats about it actually, the problem is that its just so boring, in what I can only assume was an attempt to build tension, a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious I had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready to press for most of the movie, but gave it a go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking, coz they do not half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot, I thought he looked a bit like a meercat, all this and I have not even mentioned the killer, I am not even gonna go into it, its just not worth explaining. Anyway as far as I am concerned Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London who was actually quite funny it was not because of their acting talent, I have certainly seen a lot worse, but I have also seen a lot better.

For a low budget effort, the production values are okay, and the cast are all seem to be fairly capable actors, but with not nearly enough genuine scares, a reluctance to get really messy this is a slasher, so where is the graphic splatter?, way too much dreadful dialogue particularly from the notdeadsoonenough drummer and some ill advised use of tacky video techniques in an attempt to add some style, the movie quickly becomes extremely boring.","label":0},{"index":7365,"txt":"I went to see Evening because of the cast. I would gone to see Normans Room for that reason  that movie offering Diane Keaton, Leonardo De Caprio and, also, Meryl Streep  and had loved every minute of it. Same for The Notebook even though it was chickflit lite. And my feeling was, anything offering performances by Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close would be at least as good. Instead, I found sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome trite, simplistic and  on one occasion  truly offensive material.Now I had no problem with the way the film was structured. I actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a story...so long as one era illuminates the other and vise verse. But while Vanessas character being on her deathbed and recalling a past event she felt was a mistake was riveting, at times, the part actually showing what that past mistake was does nothing to clarify the matter. In fact, it makes it seem meaningless in the silliest girl meets boy, girl gets boy, girl loses boy fashion, and in the most unbelievable, clich\u00e9d, wrongheaded way possible.And from here be spoilers, so bear that in mind should you continue reading.First of all, Claire Danes was brutally miscast. Not only does she not even begin to resemble Vanessa Redgrave as a young woman, she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting. Do not get me wrong, she can be good in the right role  just not this one. And Patrick Wilson was miscast, though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off. He would have been better suited to the part Hugh Dancy played  the rich confused WASP  and not the object of sexual attraction to one and all; he is a bit too WASPy for that. Hugh Dancy? One note  I am a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why. And the why I am a closet case in a sexually repressed world, so I have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone I know was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died as you knew he would because that is the only thing that can happen to a faggot in the Fifties so ludicrous, wrongheaded and mishandled, I nearly threw my candy at the screen.As for the modern part between Toni Collette and her sister, her fear of commitment, her jealousy of her sisters perfect life, her sister wondering if she is made the right choices, her pregnancy and her tooperfect boyfriend which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful if played by Patrick Wilson, and Ebon MossBachrach might have been a more interesting Harris, given his dreamy eyes  anyway, all this was hashed over in the 70s and 80s. And in much greater depth. Do we REALLY have to present it, again, and all as if it was fresh and momentous?And to top it off, Meryl Streep does not even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie, all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions. She is still good, but only because she is Meryl, and Meryl can find a way to pull off even the silliest dialog under the heaviest of makeup.So to put it simply, this movie has every clich\u00e9 in the really meaningful message movie book, and it adds a few that really had no business being trotted out, again. At two hours long and laced with Lifetime Movieoftheweek music that is guaranteed to rub you raw, it is a complete failure in both the meaningful and moviemaking aspects. I give it 3 only because of Meryl and Vanessa.Now, if all you require from your films is twadd le, then please set my comments about Evening aside and have the time of your life. But if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings, rent Normans Room and find out what truly great acting is.","label":0},{"index":7366,"txt":"At the time of writing this review it would seem that over 50 of IMDb voters had given this film a rating of either a 10 or a 1. I can only surmise then that those giving it a 10 were either cast or crew members. They say that given enough monkeys and enough time and enough typewriters, those monkeys, just by random proddings at the keyboard, would eventually type out the complete works of Shakespeare. However, I seriously doubt that given the same number of monkeys and time, you could find a single one to give this movie a rating of 10.I patiently watched the first half, foolishly assuming that the film would, on some level, develop either the plot or the characters, or maybe make some kind of social comment or provoke barely intellectual thought. Failing that, I was quite prepared to accept action, suspense, comedy, horror or even gratuitous sex as a way of holding my attention. Ultimately, I was disappointed and consequently, much of the second half was viewed at double speed as I searched in vain for some small snippet of cinematic redemption. Sadly, there was none.If The Choke, was put up against an episode of Scooby Doo then I am afraid the cartoon would win hands down in terms of mystery, intrigue and unpredictability. And speaking of cartoon characters, the acting abilities of the various cast members varied between acceptable at best and embarrassingly poor with Brooke Baileys portrayal of the freaky, death obsessed pseudo goth, London, being so bad I almost felt sorry for her.I would have liked to have finished on a positive note but even the soundtrack, a second rate feast of contemporary punk rock, failed even to entertain, let alone serve to enhance a very poor flick.","label":0},{"index":7367,"txt":"Four Eyed Monsters follows the relationship of a shy, reclusive videographer and an equally estranged struggling artist, who, both living in the Big Apple, develop an unlikely romance with the help of an internet dating site.

Foregoing the verbal, they take to writing notes and later communicating through video.The film is based upon the creators Arin Crumley  Susan Buice own relationship, who besides writing and directing, take to acting as the lead characters as well. With elements of avantgarde, antiplot, and docudrama, the film scatters itself to the wind with an undecided structure nestled neatly between narcissism and selfindulgence.As the movie wears on, a brief separation and deterioration of their once intriguing form of communication grow old as the couple face the hardship of reality. Focusing solely on inner conflict, or the woes of relationship, the film struggles through a stagnant narrative that is neither original, nor poignant. This could have been easily circumvented with the addition of subplot and external conflict, and a third act, to which there is none  just a montage of melodrama that leads nowhere.What is even more aggravating is the films descent from story into reality that abruptly concludes with an open ended and unsatisfying finish. This would have been all fine and dandy, but there is no question asked and no meaning to be discovered or pondered.On a side note, the film contains beautiful animation and a vivid and moving soundtrack, one of the more interesting aspects of the production.But as always, watch the film and decide for yourself.","label":0},{"index":7368,"txt":"Definitely the product of young minds, this piece may very well appeal to the 20s crowd, who is still trying to find their place in the world, while obsessing over every neurosis.

Another problem is that the peripheral characters, whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt for, are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic effect, that they fail to be relatable in any real way. However, one has to give some style points to the filmmakers, who obviously grew up in the video generation, and use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to spruce up an otherwise nonexistent plot. There are 2 points to remember here. First, beware of festival darlings. Second, even though we live in the age of youtube, not everyones account of their mundane lives deserves big screen treatment. But these young filmmakers have every right to make their film, and if others 20somethings can find something in it to identify with, then all the better. Yet I could not help but think at the end of this film how this latest generation, just now coming of age, will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications.

Likewise, FEM cannot compare with good film making for a number of reasons, and I actually believe it is a poor example of independent filmography.

The basic idea is good to explore the moral issues that would face a group of young survivors of the apocalypse. But the logic is so muddled that it is impossible to get involved.For example, our four heroes are understandably paranoid about catching the mysterious airborne contagion that is wiped out virtually all of mankind. Yet they wear surgical masks some times, not others. Some times they are fanatical about wiping down with bleach any area touched by an infected person. Other times, they seem completely unconcerned.Worse, after apparently surviving some weeks or months in this new killorbekilled world, these people constantly behave like total newbs. They do not bother accumulating proper equipment, or food. They are forever running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere. They do not take elementary precautions when meeting strangers. And after wading through the rotting corpses of the entire human race, they are as squeamish as sheltered debutantes. You have to constantly wonder how they could have survived this long... and even if they did, why anyone would want to make a movie about them.So when these dweebs stop to agonize over the moral dimensions of their actions, it is impossible to take their soulsearching seriously. Their actions would first have to make some kind of minimal sense.On top of all this, we must contend with the dubious acting abilities of Chris Pine. His portrayal of an arrogant young James T Kirk might have seemed shrewd, when viewed in isolation. But in Carriers he plays on exactly that same note arrogant and boneheaded. It is impossible not to suspect that this constitutes his entire dramatic range.On the positive side, the film looks excellent. It is got an oversharp, saturated look that really suits the southwestern US locale. But that cannot save the truly feeble writing nor the paperthin and annoying characters.

Brian Chris Pine of Star Trek is driving and his girlfriend Bobby Piper Perabo of Coyote Uglyhas shotgun, while Brians younger brother, Danny Lou Taylor Pucci of Fanboys and his friendnot exactly girlfriendKate Emily VanCamp of The Ring 2 occupy the backseat. This quartet of twentysomething characters are living in a nightmare. Apparently, a viral pandemicwhich codirectors  coscenarists Alex Pastor and David Pastor tell us absolutely nothing abouthas devastated America. Naturally, the lack of exposition shaves off at least fifteen minutes that would have slowed down this cynical melodrama about how humans degenerate in a crisis and become their own worst enemies.This lethal virus gives you the shingles and then you bleed and die. Most everybody runs around wearing those white masks strapped to their nose and mouth by a thin rubber band. Initially, this foursome encounters a desperate father, Frank Christopher Meloni of Runaway Bride,and his cute little daughter Jodie Kiernan Shipka of Land of the Lost blocking the highway with their SUV. Brian swerves around Frank when he tries to waylay them, but in the process, the oil pan in their Mercedes ruptures and they wind up on foot. Reluctantly, they hitch a ride with Frank after they seal Jodie up in the rear of the SUV. She wears a mask over her nose and mouth and it is speckled with blood. Frank has heard that doctors are curing ailing people at a hospital and they head to it. Sadly, somebody has lied to Frank. The hospital physician is giving the last couple of kids some KoolAid that will put them out of their misery. The cure did not improve their condition. Everybody else in town is dead. Kate tries without success to get a dial tone on every phone. Frank realizes that there is no hope for his daughter and he lets the heroic quartet appropriate his SUV and take off.Indeed, Carriers qualifies as a relentlessly depressing movie about the effects of a pandemic on four sympathetic people who degenerate into homicidal murderers to protect themselves. They reach a country club and frolic around on a golf course until another four show up in suits and masks with pumpaction shotguns. Incredibly, our protagonists manage to escape without getting shot, but Brian has a scare when he almost falls into the water with a floating corpse. Eventually, they discover that one of them has become infected. Later, as they are about to run out of gas, Brian blocks the highway like Frank did at the outset. Danny tries to stop a pair of older Christian women driving the car. Danny lies that his pregnant wife is about to give birth and he needs their help. Brian throws caution to the wind and blasts away at the ladies with his automatic pistol when they refuse to help them. Brian catches a slug in the leg from the passenger, but he kills her. No,Carriers is not a beer  pizza movie that you can either laugh off or laugh with because the humor is virtually nonexistent. By the end of this 84minute movie, our heroes have turned into villains who only care only for themselves and their plight. Chris Pine makes quite an impression as funloving Brian and his energetic performance is the only reason to hang with this hokum, while the only other wellknown actress, Piper Perabo, is relegated to an inconsequential girlfriend role. As Bobby, she makes tragic the mistake of showing compassion to a dying little girl and pays an awful price. It is a testament to Pines performance that he can change his character to the point of putting himself before others. Essentially, Pine has the only role that gives him the ability to pull a oneeighty from happygolucky guy to heartless guy. The two directors are Spanish brothers, and they never let the momentum flag. Since there is no relief in sight, Carriers sinks into predictability. Irr\u00e9versible cinematographer Beno\u00eet Debie does a fantastic job with his widescreen lensing and as unsavory as this road trip becomes, Debie makes it look like a dynamic film. Aside from the lack of a happy ending or closure in any sense of the word, Carriers suffers because it is so horribly cynical. The scene when the German shepherd attacks Danny conjures up the most suspense, but even it could have been improved.

It could work with the 30s setting if only there had been far less of the song and dance and far more of Shakespeares text. Unfortunately, it just ends up being a pretty trivial though very pleasant show. Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree he is far too old to play one of the students but more important, he is such an experienced Shakespearean actor that in spite of all his efforts to be just another student, his strength of acting shows all the time. Of course he should have played the King  no problem in having a mature student King surrounded by younger students. Instead we had a pleasant but unimposing actor for the King, thus an unimposing socalled King with no Kingly attributes. The amount of song and dance, which I found tedious in spite of the nice songs and pleasant enough dancing, unfortunately meant the great Shakespearean dialogue had to be cut down drastically. So the whole thing ends up a trivial and mild confection, and I got very bored, including with the comic turns, and was glad when it ended.

That being said, I will take the risk, if only because Loves Labours Lost is the perfect reward for those who overrated Mr. Branaghs directorial abilities in the past. Branagh has always been a pretty lousy director grindingly literalminded; starstruck; unforgivably ungenerous to his fellow actors he loves his American stars, but loves himself more, making damn sure that he gets all the good lines.Along those lines, the sad fact remains that Loves Labours Lost is scarcely worse than the interminable, ghastly, bloated Hamlet from 1996. In fact, this film may be preferable, if only because it is about 13 the length. Branagh decided it would be a good idea to update this bad early work of Shakespeares to the milieu of Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, yada yada. So he sets the thing in 1939, leaves about an eighth of the text intact in favor of egregious interpretations of Thirties standards wait till you see the actors heaved up on wires toward the ceiling during I am In Heaven, and casts actors not known for their dancing or singing himself included. The result is a disaster so surreal that one is left dumbfounded that they just did not call a horrified stop to the whole thing after looking at the first dailies. I do not even blame the cast. To paraphrase Hamlet, The screenplays the thing! NO ONE could possibly come off well in this hodgepodge the illustrious RSC alumni fare no better than Alicia Silverstone. Who could possibly act in this thing?Branaghs first mistake was in thinking that Loves Labours Lost was a play worth filming. Trust me, it is not. It is an anomaly in the Bards canon, written expressly for an educated coterie of courtiers  NOT the usual audience for which he wrote. Hence, there is a lot of precious and TEDIOUS! wordplay, references to contemporary scholastic nonsense, parodies of Lylys Euphues . . . in other words, hardly the sort of material to appeal to a broad audience. Hell, it does not appeal to an audience already predisposed to Shakespearean comedy. The play cannot be staged without drastically cutting the text and desperately updating it with any gimmick that comes to hand. Which begs the question, Why bother?Branaghs second mistake was in thinking that Shakespeares creampie of a play could be served with a sideorder of Gershwins marmalade.

Plans begin to fall apart however when the enigmatic Princess of France Alicia Silverstone and her entourage arrive. Soon love is in the air and philosophy is off the Princes mind.From the start, you realise that this film is not quite Shakespeare. Cleverly relocated into a 1930s musical by Ken Branagh, the plot is still there and the script remains, but now it has been sacrificed in favour of dire musical taste. Classics like The Way You Look Tonight, Let us Face The Music and Dance, I am in Heaven are all destroyed by weak singing and a strong feel that they just do not belong here.Aside from weak singing, we are also treated to an increasingly large number of awkward performances by regular stars. Ken Branagh and friends might enjoy making this film, but they provide us with a stomach turning collection of roles.The main eight actors four men  four women are all equally dire, and the only positive on their behalf is a vast improvement on the truly dreadful Timothy Spall.In fact, only one individual leaves the film worthy of any praise and that is the consistently magnificent Nathan Lane. Lane has proved over the years that he is a comedy genius and in this feature he once again adds an air of humour to the jester Costard.There is little else to be said really. Loves Labours Lost deserves mild praise for Branaghs original take on an old tale. Unfortunately though, that is where the positives end. Weakly acted, performed, sang and constructed, Loves Labours Lost is perhaps the weakest Shakespeare adaptation of the last forty years. It should be avoided like the plague and should never have been made. A poor, disappointing choice by Branagh and heres hoping his next effort is better.","label":0},{"index":7387,"txt":"Around the late 1970s, animator Don Bluth, frustrated with the output his company, Disney was churning, defected from the Mouse House to form his own studio. His first production, THE SECRET OF NIMH, was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day. This was followed by AN American TAIL and THE LAND BEFORE TIME, both of which were made under the involvement of Steven Spielberg and were commercially successful. Although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of NIMH, they still are very charming, enjoyable features for both children and grownups. But before long, Don Bluth had his first major misfire with ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN; critics were especially harsh on this film, and matters were not helped by the fact that it opened alongside Disneys THE LITTLE MERMAID.Considering that the movie has such a friendlysounding title, one would expect ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN to be pleasant family fare. Instead Bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling, deceit, crime, mistreatment, and murder. That itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say, but it does call into question over whether the film is for children. On the other hand, it is hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN. In short, it is a movie with a major identity crisis.Set in a dreary junkyard of New Orleans, the movie starts out when Charlie B. Barkin, a roughandtumble German shepherd, is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner, a nasty, cigarpuffing pitbull, Carface. Before you know it, Charlie finds himself in heaven, albeit by default. Here a whippet angel, Annabelle, tells him that all dogs go to heaven because unlike people, dogs are usually loyal and kind. This line represents the confused nature of the movie, since the dogs in the movie, the whippet aside, are presented as anything but.Upon realizing that he is been murdered, Charlie steals his way back to Earth and plots to get even with Carface. With the reluctant help of his dachshund pal Itchy, Charlie rescues Carfaces prize, AnneMarie, a human girl who can talk to animals in order to predict who will win the rat races. Charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family, but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring Carface down. Although he refuses to admit it, Charlie does grow to love AnneMarie...The concept of the story is not as problematic as the execution. Aside from the human girl AnneMarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about threequarters through with the vocal pipes of Ken Page, none of the other characters emerge as likable, nor frankly, are even worth caring about. Unfortunately, that also applies to Charlie; in trying to make him an antihero, the script composed by more than ten writers only succeeds in rendering the character TOO unlovable. As such, the audience feels no empathy for Charlie, and worse, his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing. Further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from Burt Reynolds. Besides the lack of an endearing lead, the movies other problem is in the structure of the story. The slowlypaced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movies running time. The aforementioned musical alligator who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats seems to have been thrown in from nowhere, as does a scene where Charlie tries to show his generosity to AnneMarie by feeding a pack of pastelcolored pups pizza. The whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft; a bit more polish could have made this a tighter, impactful story.Matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by Charlie Strouse and T.J. Kuenster AnneMaries song and the gators ballad are the only good ones; the latter in particular benefits from Ken Pages mellifluous vocal or the uneven voice cast. As mentioned, Burt Reynolds stiff and lifeless Charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further the only exception is a fiery confession to Itchy about his true intentions toward the end. Dom DeLuise as Itchy is pretty good, but he is had better roles, notably Tiger in AN American TAIL and Jeremy in THE SECRET OF NIMH. Ken Page, as mentioned, is awesome in anything he does, but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best. Similarly wasted are Loni Anderson as a collie who once sired a litter with Charlie, Melba Moore, and Charles Nelson Reilly. Judith Barsi as AnneMarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable, partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show.Barsi aside, the only real positive about ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN is the animation. Technically, this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from Bluths team by 1980s standards, that is, particularly a frightening scene where Charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic caninedemon. If anything, the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling.On the whole, however, I cannot recommend ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN as good entertainment. Even though I recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion, the overall package is not in the same league as Bluths better efforts. Animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry, but by the time it is over, ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth.","label":0},{"index":7388,"txt":"I am studying Catalan, and was delighted to find El Mar, a movie with mostly Catalan dialogue, at my arthouse video store.Hmmm... not so delighted to have seen it.Yes, as other reviewers have said, it is wellmade, and beautifully photographed. Although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent, it is wellacted and convincing. For the most part, that is... Would the Mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square, in full view of the dead mans 10yearold boy? Oh, well... minor detail. Up to this point, it had something of the feel of a nonmagical Pans Labyrinth, also set in the Spanish Civil War.Fastforward, and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age. Francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, both are patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen.The problem, as with so many Spanish movies apologies to Almodovar fans, is that with one exception Francisca the characters are just so dang weird. Their motivations, personalities, and dialogue are often simply incoherent.What is more, it descends into some horrific wretched excess. Be prepared for LOTS of pain and LOTS of blood. The reviewer who called it a potboiler is quite on track. If it had been made 40 years ago, the poster would have said SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE!! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY!! BETRAYAL!! The opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable. To work, this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters. As it is, it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between Brother Sun, Sister Moon and Pulp Fiction. If that sounds like something you have got to see, by all means, enjoy. I think I go with something that does not make me feel I need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom.As for the Catalan, it is the Mallorqui dialect, fairly different than the Barcelona dialect, though I was surprised by the comment that said that even Barcelonans apparently needed Catalan subtitles to understand it.","label":0},{"index":7389,"txt":"This is just short of a full blown gore fest based on a Stephen King story.

It is all so patronizing and condescending. Wow, that was fun, was not it? No it was not. And unfortunately it seems to have permeated into children films as well. And that is what Flight of the Reindeer is all about. Admittedly I have not seen Flight of the Reindeer in a few years so I might be hazy on some points, but I remember being thoroughly unimpressed with it at the time. Essentially, the story follows a lecturer who is given a book for Christmas. Now, the lecturer is an esteemed scientist on the flying habits of some animal. I think it was bullfrogs. Anyway, through this book, Mr Lecturer  family man learns that reindeer can fly in exactly the same way as bullfrogs. Apparently this book was written by a scientist many hundreds of years ago who disappeared in the North Pole. Now, if it were me I would have thrown the book out the nearest window. Flying bullfrogs are a naturally occurring phenomenon, but flying reindeer is a fantastic and wholly unrealistic concept. But, Mr lecturer Is not me, so I guess that explains why he decides to fly to the north pole leaving his wife and kid at home with no idea where he is gone. Of course, things go awry and before he knows it, a flying reindeer has crashed into his private plane and he is stranded at the North Pole. Are you still following this? Good. His family, of course, are devastated. I would be too, I mean, what a sucktacular Christmas. Elsewhere, Mr lecturer finds himself in a hidden town at the North Pole inhabited by midgets and one tyrannical figure who dresses only in red and white. Rather than try to escape immediately, as I would have done, he greets everyone there with open arms. This hidden civilization of midget monsters, and he greets them with open arms. Ooookayyyy. They feed him this story that they are the elves of Santa Claus and they spend all year round making toys for kids they have no idea exist. And Mr lecturer accepts all this. He even accepts that Santa Claus is in fact the scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or whatever. There is just one problem  they do not want him to leave. The world cannot know of their secret existence. After all, before they would know it there would be a McDonalds and a Starbucks on every street corner. Still with me?Now, Mr nice guys family find the book and assume he is gone to the North Pole. Boy, would not they be embarrassed if they found out he would just gone for a brisk walk? Before the audience knows it, they are jetting off to spend a Christmas in the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet. Meanwhile, Mr lecturer gets sick of all the uppity midgets and decides to leave. I cannot remember exactly, but I do recall him holding Santa Claus to gunpoint. A fire fight ensues when the midgets attack and he manages to escape via Santas sleigh. With Santa hot on his heels and with bloodlust in his eyes, Mr Whatever, through some marvellous coincidence, finds himself flying alongside his familys plane that is looking for him. So he jumps on to their plane, the planes flies back and everyone lives happily ever after. The fact is, there have been some shocking films made in the name of Christmas over the years but because they feature that festive charm they get away with it. And it is that charm that is utterly devoid from Flight of the Reindeer There is not much wrong with it; nothing which insults the intelligence well, obviously there IS, but it is a kids film and thus can get away with such things or anything particularly offensive, but the problem is there is nothing much right about it either. It just does not FEEL Christmassy. And for a film that is all about Christmas, that it a pretty major flaw. But hey, I do not think Flight of the Reindeers target audience mind about that? Why should they? They are all so doped up on sedatives they probably could not spell Christmas I give it three out of ten. If it was a TVMovie then I would add another two stars onto it.

It astounds me that people can stand all the noise out there these days. The basic plot of the film is that it makes for an interesting topic. It is too bad that is about it. Tim Robbbins is decent although except for a couple of scenes especially with the absolute supermodel looking Margarita Leiveva he did not seem to really be altogether there. My biggest hope for this film is that casting agents will see the absolutely stunning  talented actress to boot, Margarita Levieva. She does not have a lot to do, but she is supermodel beautiful. Even when they are trying to make her look at more girl next door. It makes me sad that there can be people such as Paris Hilton  Kim Kardashian in the world wno redeemable skills or talent, to have more fame and success than this talented beauty. I did not care for much of this film because the script is not very good, but am glad I got to see some new talent. I hope that producers  directors think about Margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be in there big budget film. If they can make Megan Fox a star cmon she is not that hot,  her acting talent is worse than madefor Disney channel TV shows from 1 film, it should happen easily for her, as she is gorgeous  has talent!

Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who cannot deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer, particularly car alarms. It is an odd idea for a film, which has about as much creative credibility as Death Wish. It is clever at points; particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through Hagel, I am too stupid to be understanding this. He reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion, we read it and do not get it either.Just then a car alarm goes off. Throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises. Though, all in all it does little to help us understand our hero, who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeperinto his persona. The filmmaking itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems, shoddy editing, and visible boom mikes. No, Noise is not allbad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the ending does not fall flat. Overall it drives home a logistical point, one you have not probably thought of. At least I had not. Though all in all, ninety minutes long, it could not have ended sooner. The story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started.This is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival, but probably will not get picked up for distribution. Check it out on DVD if you are really partial to someone involved in the project. Otherwise skip it.","label":0},{"index":7414,"txt":"I have been using IMDb for a few years now, but have never written any reviews before. However, this movie so disappointed me even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing that I could not keep quiet anymore.Noise is the story of a New Yorker Tim Robbinswho is so perturbed by noise pollution that he takes on an alterego as a as a vigilante, The Rectifier, and vandalizes any cars he finds with a caralarm sounding.I take the name of the movie to be somewhat of a misnomer. Although there are one or two instances of other sources of noise being addressed or mentioned, the only true focus of our protagonist is car alarms. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There is really no other focus. When the movie tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms, it seems to be just thrown in to give merit to the actions of Robbins character. Yes, we are all annoyed by noise. Nobody likes the sound of car alarms. Of course we all have that internal urge to take a baseball bat to a shrieking vehicle, and this movie uses that fact, and pretty much that fact alone, to sell this movie. I say pretty much because there is also a blatantly contrived sexual relationship including a completely needless threesome which is obviously thrown in for those moviegoers who need such things thrown in in order to enjoy a movie. Honestly, it is eyerolling.Robbins character, very shortly into the movie, becomes completely unrelatable. It seems less that he decides not to put up with the noise anymore, and more that by focusing so much on the noise he has begun to lose his sanity. The first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from just an angry, carbashing dude into this hero of the little guy, The Rectifier. However... the transformation does not take place. He just renames himself.I could go on for a while. Annoying generalized social commentary comes in every now and then to add to the pretentiousness of the movie, and the selfsatisfied smirk which never quite leaves Robbins face does not help either. Overall, I think it is very obvious what this movie is trying to be, as it is pretty much shoved down your throat, but in my opinion, it fails in a big way. Just one guys opinion, cheers.","label":0},{"index":7415,"txt":"Mirror. Mirror 1990 is a flat out lame movie. Why did I watch movies like this when I was younger? Who knows?

Its only those who can carry different beats in a nice sequential manner, for an extended period who are considered great.Which brings us to the other instrument, the Dumroo hardly requires any talent, it has no variations, and it may be enjoyable for a while the monkey dances hmm sounds like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy, but its not a instrument that will entertain you for long or even get you dancing like the Dhol does.This movie was like the dhol and the dumroo being played, sometimes the Dhol was played sometimes the dumroo, sometimes both together, but mostly the Dumroo played alone and the monkey danced. And like any 24 year old sooner than later I got bored.The movie has some good Dhol good moments but after a while all i heard was the annoying Dumroo entertaining initially, then tolerable then irritating, the large ordinary parts really ensure this movie is mainly good for a few funny clips on MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA if you have not watched it watch it on Filmy, it comes in the evenings and is really quite funny.This movie had its moments, the actors did a fine job, except Rajpal Yadav who can act though, I have seen him in Main Meri Patni\u0085 who annoys more than entertains, I have said it many time and I will say it again I really think Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a fine career ahead of them in the multistar comedies especially.Some scenes were really funny such as the aborted attempts to impress the girls father, the zany attempts to woo the girl and take her away from each other.But after this was over there was a failed attempt to make this movie into much more with a mystery added, this mean that once the girl was in, the following 4560 mins was increasingly torturous, the climax was SO BAD ITS ALMOST GOOD CATEGORY, I mean what were they thinking if you had to have tense ending at least make some attempt to make it palatable.The movie is also extremely predictable, there is hardly a scene you cant predict and you wont be breaking into spontaneous burst of laughter here, its more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before the gag.The movie follows a gradual decline throughout the movies except for the odd bump, down or up, and then rapidly tumbles downhill once they have made friends with the girl.Most of the really bad scenes were towards the end, one the movie tries to be more than a run of the mill comedy, also many of the jokes were very very stale and reeked of repetition, THE LAST 1015 WAS ESPECIALLY DISTATEFULL AND COMPLETELY SPOILS THIS MOVIE.I did not find Tanushree Datta quite the siren she was to play, and her acting talent is in serious question, especially in view of her nonappealing looks, if you cant be a HOT and cant act how much time can you survive.Technically also this movie was weak, with the constant female gaze and shoddy lighting and camerawork.The songs except the title track were no good either, when the songs played in the 2nd half I could feel the collective gasp from the audience.In all a movie that is just ordinary merely because of the cast, and the very low expectations.Avoiding it wont be a bad idea.And if it has to be watched watching it on TV for free or a very cheap matin\u00e9e or something is a must, if you pay full multiplex rates you will feel disappointed.s lots of stale jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, LAST 45 MINS AND LAST 15 MINS ESPECIALLY, bad technically, bad songs.s tries to be more than what it was, not the regular cast I am happier for it, Tanushree Datta.s some good scenes towards the beginning,title song, good acting and cast except RY.total 4.510 I am trying to be objective here, i do not like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie did meet my very low expectations, so I am giving it the benefit of all doubts, on absolute terms this movie was not more than a 4","label":0},{"index":7420,"txt":"The movie starts with a nice song Looks like a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan walking around in a suspicious way but then suddenly we are forced to a comedy With the routine stupid idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal acting like grown up kids Their scenes are quite funny first and then get boring There is a bored sub plot of Tanushrees brother being killed Towards the end the film tries to get serious with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here it gets even stupid Then a lengthy bashing bashing climax straight out of HERA PHERI and wait, there is also a long chase in Payals houseThe film is so boring that it makes you fall asleepDirection by Priyan is very bad musicPritam is routine except the first songCinematography is bad, the film has a cheap look throughoutRajpal Yadav is good in his 1st scene where he goes to pay his rent and i was happy that the actor is not loud and over the top like other films But No, He becomes his usual self and gets irritating most of the times Tusshar should not speak in a film, his dial delivery is terrible Sharman is the saving grace, He is the sole actor who acts very well in this film Kunal Khemmu tries hard in his first comic film as an adult, But does not impress much Tanushree is bad as always Arbaaz Khan gets less scope and is usual Payal is a non actress Murli Sharma is terrible","label":0},{"index":7421,"txt":"First of all there is Gujarati Theatre then there is Bollywood.

Now with hideous films like Dhol, the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be torture.Dhol is a mixture of bad, unfunny toilet jokes, somewhat of drama, poor suspense and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny, though not witty, and secondly, except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandma, the acting was decent. Speaking of the acting, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top if you compare them with the others in the movie, then came Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above. The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting. The grandma, firstly resembled a ghost, plus she was not funny at all but rather silly.The plot was the same, seen before one. Four boys behind girls and in need of money, but with a few twists. There is a bad man who is preposterously stupid and dumb. And at last, the good wins over the bad and everything is fine. The idea of having a Dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty.The worst thing about the movie is its length. After an hour or so, you get exhausted and want to leave the theater.

And on technical terms, its very good. David Lean just KNEW films from the getgo. There are many moments where Cowards studied dialogue takes a second seat and Leans visual sense takes centre stage. Try the soldiers getting off the ship near the end, and that whole scene; the tracking shot towards the hymn singing, the scene where we are inside a house that gets bombed.Noel Coward is one of the worst actors i have ever seen.

Mr Coward might have had the respect of the gentlemen of the chorus at Drury Lane and Binkie Beaumont might have been terrified of him but his ability to tame,mould and direct a ships crew in wartime must be brought into question.He folds himself languorously around the bridge,patronising the other ranks and barking orders at the officers,he only needed a silk dressing gown and a cigarette holder to seem right at home. Much is made of the warship as a microcosm of British Societytheme,and the crew largely comprises of the usual cheery cockneys,canny northerners etc.without whom no war can be fought.They spend most of their time on board smoking,moaning about Lord Haw Haw and getting blown up. Never mind,there is plenty more where they came from.Once ashore they go straight to the pub where they spend most of their time smoking,moaning about Lord Haw Haw and getting blown up .By contrast Mr Coward lives in a dream cottage with a rose covered door somewhere very quiet with very little chance of getting blown up.He,his lady wife and their two rosy cheeked cherubs converse in ludicrously convoluted tones and said lady wife spends much of her time knitting things for the poor unfortunates who comprise his crew and who she refers to by their surnames.That nice young master Johnny Mills has a prominent role as a completely unbelievable lower deck type who worships Mr Coward in much the same way as a thrashed dog will worship its master.He marries his girlfriend after kissing her on the cheek,presumably on the grounds that she might be pregnant after such unfettered passion. So yes,we do have a microcosm of British society here,but perhaps not in the way the makers of In which we serve intended.

Later that night they go out for pie, and she asks Jon a question that begins to shake him from his catatonic state of existence, I want you to tell me something that you have never told a single soul. If you do, it will make this night indelible. Jon then tells her a reoccurring dream of his in which he wanders about town looking at the faces of strangers passing him by, yet none of them look him in the eye. I imagine it must be what death feels like, he says.The next day Janes wild boyfriend Cleveland Saarsgard kidnaps Jon from work and takes him out to a hulking abandoned steel mill, and soon Jon, Cleveland and Jane are spending every waking moment together going to punk rock concerts, doing drugs and drinking lots of alcohol. This does not sit well with Phlox, who pushes Jon for a more personal relationship, namely letting her meet his new friends and his father. The film then attempts to take us on Jons journey as he shakes off the shackles imposed on him by his father, Phlox and his deadend job as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with Cleveland and Jane.There is a problem having us follow Jon throughout the film he is completely uninteresting. He has no ambitions, passions or goals. He walks through life like the invisible wraith he described to Jane the night they met. At the outset this is not a problem. But he never gets any more interesting. He is a completely passive character. He simply follows along the bohemian Cleveland and Jane, but he never once gives us any inkling as to what he cares about or wants to to do with himself.Consequently, the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and little to do other than party, have sex and get in arguments. In other words, much ado about nothing. What we have here is the shallow skin of a good movie without anything on the inside. Sweeping cinematography, ponderous voiceover with characters staring off into the distance, lots of sex scenes both straight and gay, big arguments, more angry sex, a chase scene and a tragic death... but it does not seem to matter. Ironically, at one point Jane, confused at a number of Jons aimless actions, asks him, What is going on, Jon? What is this all about? Yes, Jon, do tell. We in the audience are dying to know, too.The title The Mysteries of Pittsburgh must refer to the characters themselves, because that is what they are.

The quality of deMilles direction is very low, and he does not show any particular skill that is unique to him. The photography is standard and flat, and the editing is hardly more dynamic. One could easily classify it as a fashion show and be pretty correct. DeMille gets to dress Miss Joy up in so many different types of clothes evening gowns, golfing costumes, motoring costumes, piles of furs that it is subtitle could be Fashions of 1922One thing more disappointing than the photography or editing or the direction is the acting, which is mostly flat and wooden. When it is not, it is merely routine silent gesturing, rolling eye balls, twitching eye brows and deliberate pointing and arm movements. What would have been enlivened for modern viewers by mugging and scene chewing of some of the worst silent films, is here merely dull to watch. The only member of the cast who succeeds in any form of excellence is Lois Wilson, who is not only beautiful but is able to play her role naturally. She is convincing and endearing in tearful closeups, as long as you do not read the moralizing title card that follows once she opens her mouth to speak. Like I said, everybody else is droningly routine, Joy, Meighan, even Julia Faye. Her performance here makes a good argument for why she never attained true stardom.The worst and most amusing part of this movie is the heavy moralistic tone that carries through all of it. Meighans character has plenty of intertitles where he drones on about how the youth of America is declining in it is moral stance, and going right back to the decadence of Rome. insert absurd flashback This movies moralizing has been described as Victorian, but it is further than that. It has so little bearing in reality that I have a feeling audiences at that time did not take it any more seriously than modern viewers could.This movie is exactly what the unknowing tend to think of as a typical silent movie, with it is archaic moral structure, wooden acting and bad direction. DeMille shows that he could be a terrible director, with no sense of pacing, camera placement, or skill in handling either script or actors. I cannot imagine anybody in their right mind taking it seriously. Boring, slow and idiotic, I recommend it to hardcore silent movie dorks like myself only.","label":0},{"index":7432,"txt":"well well One cant b wasting time just cause of a big starcast ..i think all i could see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor which will appeal to i do not know who? some pathetic songs that will be heard by who? some pathetically abrupt turnings justified by who? race against time? u mean waste against time?

According to the movie, Slovik had reformed, got a good woman, and did not want to fight.In real life, Slovik may have been a naive innocent, or he may have just wanted to manipulate the system.Whoever Slovik was or was not is for history to decide, but this was a movie that dealt with dessertion at a time when a country was questioning why it was fighting, and the movie took sides.With no regard to servicemen who were in Viet Nam either in 1974 as Willie Nelson would say, let us tell the truth, it was about the Viet Nam war, not WWII, EoES was as propagandistic as Gung Ho was in the forties.According to this movie, Slovik stated his position, plain and simple. He had a nervous problem. Heck, I have a clinical nervous condition, and trust me, if I had done military duty, it would have been no problem for me to either just let my nerves go and fail at my tasks and get a demotion or put on KP duty or latrine duty with no problem.If we believe the teleflick, Slovik did not have that option, no doubt because of his criminal history.Whatever the viewer wants to believe is up to the viewer. I have learned that movies from this decade or that decade, in dealing with service or military duty, will pretty much take the same stance over and over.1940s and 1950s, serve your country.1960s and 1970s, mock your country.This is the history.The whole movie seemed predictably Hollywood to me. He refused to serve and only when he was being strapped up to be executed does he show emotion.Such an emotional outburst could have easily worked to his advantage in his declaration of his nervous condition, but obviously the movie wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is about to die does he become sorrowful.I am not a Catholic, but I thought the recital of the hail Mary by Ned Beatty and Sheen at the end, with the Lords prayer, was funny as it sounded like they were trying to see who could say it faster.I do not see how this movie could be watched without realizing it was aimed at Tricky Dick Nixon and the Viet Nam war.I hope it was all worth it for Slovik and anyone who chose to follow his example.","label":0},{"index":7438,"txt":"Ooof!

The events take place in Tromaville, a little town that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world, and they certainly are not lying.

They just do not seem to have been _told_ about them or something. Bullets _bounce_ off of dinosaurs! Maybe it is because they became extinct millions of years before the invention of gunpowder, and the laws of physics were just different back then... Aah, no. Come on. If they are close enough to chemically operate today, they would have to be vulnerable to fast even subsonic lead projectiles. It is that simple.Look, the toughestskinned reptiles on the planet today, alligators and crocodiles, are completely vulnerable to basic rifle fire. They are nothing magic. You can shoot a pistol round right through the heavy scales on their backs. They do not take armorpiercing bullets or anything special. Small bullets penetrate them, they just do not kill them. Somewhat but not REALLY large bullets are preferred because the challenge as with most game is to kill the animal with one shot, so it does not run. Hunters consider it immoral to allow prey to run off and die unharvested.Most animals, including predators, are easily repelled by gunfire. Between the noise, and the pain of even a nonlethal wound, most will run away. An exception are big bears, which are so fearless that they are merely enraged by mortal wounds. Cape buffalo are regarded as highly dangerous because they are well known to charge when wounded. We have seen video of the big bulls of a herd of cape buffalo rescuing a calf from an entire pride of lions. A big cat will run if it can, but if it cannot it will charge as a final act of desperation. Where a T.Rex would fit in this spectrum is unknown. Their behavior simply has not been observed. With these larger animals, safe hunting becomes a matter of applying an appropriately large and powerful projectile, andor applying several of them rapidly enough to counter its charge. With a T.Rex, of course, this could be a serious problem. I have seen a T.Rex skull they have one in the museum downtown and carrying a gun big enough to bust that might be impractical. Chewing its neck off with lots of smaller fire might be a more viable approach. Small bullets would still _penetrate_ them, they would not just bounce off just because the animal is too big to easily kill! So here we have Cortez and his men this is _before_ the famous Mexican campaign, apparently captured by American natives and scheduled for sacrifice on the pyramid. It appears that all those human sacrifices were about appeasing the bloodthirst of the pair of T.Rexes that terrorized the continent in the day. Rather than just having their hearts cut out and being fed to the lizards, Cortez et al talk the Aztecs into letting them hunt  kill them. OK, maybe they do not have M16s like the guys in the Carnosaur series, but they _do_ have flintlocks, crossbows, pointed sticks big ones, made from trees and swords. Maybe that is a little less uneven than squads of soldiers with full auto, but they have several guys and I would quickly bet on them over a dinosaur. Oh, wait, there is a _cannon_, about a 4incher. That is just the ticket for busting a Tyrannosaurus skull! So they lay a trap, with a squad of men, cannon, pointed sticks in a ravine, and lure the first T.Rex into it, using a pretty brown girl as bait. Cortez points out that they will NOT have time to reload, so they will have to close the range until they can be certain of their aim. T.Rex totally ignores their volley of flintlock fire, and we see both a crossbow bolt _and_ the cannon ball _bounce_ off! Forget it. End of credibility. A crossbow bolt would defeat Cortez torso armor, and a 4 cannon ball might penetrate the hull of a wooden ship! This would also _certainly_ get through the hide, ribcage, or skull of any animal ever to walk this planet. Do you think a _whale_ could withstand a 4 cannon ball? And heres T.Rex, still standing, not even bleeding. So Cortez lures it to the ravine, where it falls onto the pointed sticks, which I guess by magic penetrate it and kill it. Yaaay, pointed sticks! The dinos are not completely invulnerable to gunfire  they manage to put out an eye of the second one with a pistol. This runs it off, so it is NOT as mean as a bear or a buffalo, at least in the movies.They kill the second dinosaur with a bomb  made from a gourd filled with gunpowder and gemstones. My money would still be on the cannon. It is engineered function is to concentrate all the gunpowders energy in one direction  toward the target. A bomb is a much more diffused application of force. A _real_ bomb NOT a gourd bomb has a steel casing which contains the explosion to extremely high pressure. Think pipe bomb vs firecracker. A pile of gunpowder set on fire will simply go POOF. Trust me on that one.","label":0},{"index":7469,"txt":"I have never seen one of these SciFi originals before, this was the first. I think it only fair to judge the acting, directionproduction, set design and even the CGI effects on the other SciFi movies. To compare it to your typical Hollywood production is unfair. I will say, however, that overall Aztec Rex was not exactly reminiscent of Werner Herzogs masterpiece Aguirre, Wrath of God.I will begin by noting that, yes, I do recognize the fact that this movie has more to do with cultureclash than it does with dinosaurs. Despite this being a madeforTV scifi movie, there is some underlying context to the story which I shall examine. The symbolic elements included are evident enough.Consequently, as a student of history, theology, mythology and film I found the dialogue outrageous and the plot themes to be somewhat insulting. I am not asking for any mea culpas on behalf of the producers  as I said before the movie is what it is. But what concerns me is that much of the younger demographic for this movie probably rely on television to provide them their lessons when it comes to history and cultural diversity.The main problem manifests itself most visibly with the character Ayacoatl not a commentary on Dichen Lachmans performance, but simply how her character was written, although, I will say she has some work to do before she receives any Emmy nods. It is through her character that the Spanish Europeans actions are justified. Her function in the film as the love interest of Rios affirms that the European way is the right way, simply because they are European. There is really no other reason given. It is really just left to the assumption that the viewer is meant to associate themselves with the Europeans over the Aztec because their dress, language, ideology, etc is more familiar to them than the Aztec  so therefore the Aztec are portrayed as adversarial and backwards. And it is not simply that the viewer is left with that assumption due to ethnocentric perception on the viewers part, but it really seems like the story is trying to convince the viewer  As if the Aztec were not capable of coming up with a plan  if not a better one  to lure a dinosaur to its death on a bed of punji sticks.In fairness, there is a subgroup of the Spanish who are portrayed as looting temples and intent on simply abusing the native MesoAmericans. There is also a scene where we have the Christian holy man noting the achievements of the Aztec They have agriculture, medicine, calendar, etc.  But in the end it is still the Aztec warrior who is portrayed as the main antagonist of the movie, even over the thunder lizards more on that later. He his portrayed as treacherous, duplicitous and attempts to dispatch the romantic European Spaniard by tricking him into consuming hallucinogenic mind altering mushrooms  an important spiritual component to certain aspects and religions of the native Meso  North Americans again, more on this later so that he can keep the female he feels belongs to him and away from the Spaniard. Now in analyzing the true nature of the story leaving the obvious Christian vs. Pagan themes off of the table from a symbolic standpoint  a viewer can easily take these socalled thunder lizards to be representatives of the MesoAmerican ideologytheology, which in this movie is portrayed as being one intent on bloodthirstiness, mercilessness, cruelness, wicked, maybe even evil? In opposition, we have this group of Christian wanderers, led by a young Hernando Cortes who are portrayed as naive, yet overall noble, lambs caught up in the dark heathen world of the Aztec. Also, the name of the film is Aztec Rex, leading one to believe that it is about dinosaurs out to eat people. However, what Aztec Rex translates to is Aztec King, a the head of the Aztec state, or in this instance stateofbeing. Hence, why the title of the film was changed. And so who in fact do we see as the new Aztec king at the end? It is the remaining Spaniard, Rios. Aztec Rex is in reference to the new European ideology which overcame, through disease, bloodshed, war  famine, Native Americans. Rios symbolizes the ideal European  as the presenters of this film would like them to be remembered in opposition to Cortes who represents the practicalyetstillnoble European. But when you examine the Holocausts of the Americas, let us be honest do not the symbolic components of this films story have it backwards? I have to say Aztec Rex is at worst a little racist, or to be kind about it, ignorant at best.And yes, I know it is just a movie, all meant to be in fun, I understand, but so at the end we are left with the idea that Rios was the father of the last remaining Aztec lines? I wonder what Native MesoAmericans would have to think about this ending... as for myself, I thought it was a little too self indulgent.Best supporting performance of the movie goes to Ian Zierings wig  although conspicuous  it did at least alter Zierings appearance enough so that I did not think I was watching the yuppie from 90210 leading a bunch of conquistadors into the heart of darkness. Ziering actually proves himself to be a morethancapable actor in this movie, I actually bought his performance, or at least I forgot it was Ian Ziering anyway. I do not know whom his agent is, but he should get more work.In closing, it was also a pleasure to see Jim McGee again.

Within minutes they have their first sight of local Aztec savages, within minutes after that Cortes  his men are captured  held prisoner. If that was not bad enough it turns out that a couple of Tyrannosaurus Rex live there  like to eat the locals, in an effort to win their lives the Spanish offer to help the locals get rid of their monster problem but with various hidden agendas  ulterior motives it is not just the dinosaurs they have to watch out for...Directed by Brian TrenchardSmith who, coincidently, made one of my all time favourite exploitations films Turkey Shoot 1982 which I throughly recommend to one  all  also more commonly known under the spoof sounding title of Aztec Rex the title was changed by the SciFi Channel when they aired it maybe as the original title Tyrannosaurus Azteca sounds like it might be a foreign film this is yet another idiotic  cheap looking SciFi Channel Creature Feature  that is all you need to know really. Based on  around the real Spanish Conquistador Cortes during his expedition to Mexico the film definitely does not strive for historic accuracy although I will admit that the story tries to do something slightly different here but ultimately Tyrannosaurus Azteca is still just a Creature Feature with a bunch of people running from some poor CGI computer graphic of a monster despite it is period setting. Not too sure what else I can say, despite being set centuries ago the usual clich\u00e9s are here, the characters are the usual cardboard cutouts, make stupid decisions  the selfish one, the heroic one, the backstabbing one, the faceless victim who exists just to get eaten  the pretty woman are all here  easy to spot. The film is predictable, silly, dull  does not really entertain on any level although it does move along at a decent pace  there is one or two half decent moments of gore if that sort of thing interests you. The story is not that good  has plenty of holes too, this is also the sort of film that you will have completely forgotten about within a few days.Now I have seen  commented on plenty of SciFi Channel Creature Features  usually the CGI computer effects are terrible  while Tyrannosaurus Azteca does not exactly buck the trend I will admit there are a few effects shots which look alright but then they are usually ruined by an absolutely awful effects shot straight afterwards. There is a few decent gore effects here too, there is a cut out heart, a guys leg is bitten off, there is some blood splatter, a cool shot of a guy left holding his own intestines after he has been attacked by the dinosaur, there is a few dead bodies seen  someone is stabbed with a spear. The TRex gets to eat a couple of people too. The production values are really cheap, the Aztec set looks like one of those theme park attractions made from Styrofoam  those Spanish men must have been imprisoned in the worst enclosure in cinematic history with the fence supposedly keeping them in lower than a mans waist, they could have simply stepped out of it  run away it was so low.With a supposed budget of about 900,000 I cannot see where the money went, shot in Oahu in Hawaii in apparently fifteen days. The acting is not great from noone I have ever heard of.Tyrannosaurus Azteca really is not any better than any other cheap SciFi Channel Creature Feature despite an almost interesting  unusual premise, that basic statement should basically be enough for you to decide whether you will enjoy this or not at a guess probably not.","label":0},{"index":7472,"txt":"I do not know if this is one of the SyFy Channel original movies, but that is exactly what it feels like. A cheap, low budget action movie that was probably made very quickly, it contains laughable effects, lame dialog, and one vaguely faded star to give some name brand recognition to it funny how many of the kids from 90210 are doing cheap TV movies now.Ian Ziering plays Cortes, who we know from history as the explorer who wiped out entire populations of native people while conquering parts of North America. Here, he is not played as a hero or even sympathetic, but as a slimy opportunist; his character would probably be killed off if this were not loosely based on a historical figure. In this story, Cortes is on a brief surveying mission, trying to find something of value to prove he deserves financing to further explore America. He and his men find a small tribe of Aztecs plagued by dinosaurs.The actual hero of the story turns out to be Lt. Rios, who proves to be honorable, resourceful, and wise. He knows the right thing to do in every situation, which puts him at opposition with Cortes, as well as with the young, ambitious Aztec shaman. Of course, the native girl who is supposed to marry the headstrong, scheming shaman falls for Rios, furthering his anger towards the Spanish outsiders. So it is all pretty clich\u00e9. The dinosaurs are dispatched with relative ease. Despite taking place in an area that seems wide open, the story pretty much takes place in either the woods, or the Aztec village for 95 of the time, so it is not visually exciting either.I did not even recognize Ian Ziering. They gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent, and somehow he disappeared into it. He does not look or sound Spanish for a second, however, making the casting choice wrong in every way. If this movie had been released theatrically, he would have been singled out for a Razzie, no question.Overall, forgettable.","label":0},{"index":7473,"txt":"Take a SciFi Original Movie and mix in a little alternativerevisionist history, and you get Aztec Rex. Apparently Hernand Cortes, before conquering the Aztec empire, had to first conquer a Tyrannosaurus Rex and her mate. That is the thrust of this movie. Given the plot it could have really sucked; the fact that it only kind of sucked is a tip of the cap to the writers. There are a few problems. For starters, Cortes is played by Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig, Ziering as Cortes is about as convincing as Axl Rose playing Gandhi. And though Cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztecs here seem to be played by an allHawaiian ensemble. Casting aside, the TRexes look reasonably good, though every time one of them gets shot it just oozed CGI. And they die too easily; I suppose if a TRex were around in real life they probably could be felled or at least wounded by some rather rudimentary, 16thcentury weaponry. But it takes something away from the movie. There are also some graphic TRexswallowinghuman scenes, which is surprising, but in this context I thought they worked OK. There is plenty of action, and the whole colonization angle is prevalent throughout but does not overwhelm the dinosaur angle, unlike the other recent SciFi Original dinosaur movie Warbirds.

What was not was the casting of blue eyed Ian Ziering as Cortes. Even with the blond hair made famous in Beverly Hills 90210 dyed black, Ian looked positively ridiculous. At least he made no attempt at a Spanish accent.The real hero of Tyrannosaurus Azteca is Marco Sanchez also late of a television series with a semirecurring role in Walker Texas Ranger as Detective Sandoval of the Dallas PD. He finds true love with an Aztec princess and life would be just perfect if it was not for those pesky prehistoric beasts the natives worship.Tyrannosaurus Azteca looks like they used some outtakes from the famous SidMarty Krofft series the Land of the Lost.

Then we are forced to watch this family continually get lost and then found and then hug and then cry and lost and then found followed by of course more hugging and crying to the point that I was actually wishing for some sort of natural disaster to just wipe all of these vapid, ignorant people off the planet. Do not get me wrong, because I love indies, but an indie about dumb people and I mean really dumb is simply ridiculous and pointless. It is really a shame that this movie was based on such insipid characters wallowing in such retarded scenarios, because the locale was interesting.","label":0},{"index":7484,"txt":"This is one of those films the British Lottery Fund wastes its money on. The main problem is a rambling script which gets nowhere. The characters are not interesting, the story is conventional and insipid, the only thing of interest is the location the city of Genoa Genova in Italian. Having only a superficial acquaintance with Genoa, I had no idea of the intricate alleyways of its Old Town, and that the city was so interesting. I had thought Genoa was dull. I am delighted to say that I have been proved wrong. So from the travelogue point of view, this film has interest. The film contains one splendid performance, by a little girl named Perla HaneyJardine. She has already made seven films despite being only 12, so she seems determined upon a career as an actress, and judging by her performance in this film, she should go far, as she is a natural and has a great deal of talent. Colin Firth, a reliable and professional actor, was on hand for the filming and when asked to be earnest, he was earnest, and when asked to be anguished, he was anguished. But somebody forgot to give him any worthwhile dialogue. The script is a total shambles. Catherine Keener does exceptionally well in a supporting role, and showing sympathy comes naturally to her, so that everybody would like to have her around I would like to tell her every time I feel a cold coming on, as I know she would get me a soothing hot drink. So there we have it Genoas fascinating narrow alleys, an interesting little girl, and a sympathetic woman. Forget the rest. The older sister played by Willa Holland is such a disgusting character that the fact that the young actress does a good job of being repellent is not exactly the kind of acting tribute she would like to hear, I suspect. The notion that this family go off to Genoa to forget the unfortunate death of the mother is so trite that if we have another film like that, all dead mothers have a right to complain at being exploited. If Michael Winterbottom wanted to make a film about how interesting the old portion of Genoa is, why did not he just go to the BBC and say he wanted to make a travel film with some mindless celebrity presenter? Why waste money on a feature film which is nothing but a vanity project of idle and meandering vacuity?","label":0},{"index":7485,"txt":"Why on earth is Colin Firth in this pointless film?

It was not clear what here job was, but she seemed only to be there to make vapid, inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl. Was it supposed to be about paedophillia??A pretty dreadful mess, all in all.

She said she had seen it before. It is funny and sad! I cried the first time I saw it, she gushed. Maybe compared to other Bollywood movies this deserves a 7.5 out of 10, but in comparison to all the other movies I have seen in my lifetime, this deserves no more than a 3. Any movie where I can perpetually guess what is going to happen next is no good for me. The characters are unbelievable, how the act is not realistic at all and their motives are contrived. It is over dramatic and the songs are not all that great. My biggest problem with Bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety. All the emotions are way too overdone and thus not at all realistic. Any emotion or bond between characters that is the least bit subtle must be magnified with an unnecessary song. I think I understood that the relationship between the father and son was more like one between friends than one between a parent and child without having to have it conveyed via a five minute long song. The stupid comic relief complete with laugh track was not funny or necessary we get it, Laxman is not the sharpest tool in the shed. If a movie tries to elicit tears through the most hackneyed means possible it just is not meaningful, just a bit embarrassing.SPOILERGenerally if someone has terminal stage lung cancer their son who lives with them would know something was wrong without having to be told. Too many plot holes to count. At first the movie was amusing and cute in the way Bollywood movies are to people who do not watch them that avidly but it just got tedious. It takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is amusing and heartwrenching and the best way to do it is usually not having all the amusing parts in the first half of the movie and all the heartwrenching parts at the end.SPOILER OVER Perhaps it had a very little more depth than other Bollywood movies that I have seen, but not much at all. I spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the parts that were supposed to be funny. I did not shed a single tear nor did I feel like it, rather I was overwhelmed with a feeling of disgust at the attempt at a dramatic ending.

First and foremost, why anyone thought this lessersitcom material would ever make even a halfdecent motion picture. In the kooky 60s teleplay, the unique idea of Martians among us had not yet been given the sophisticated XFiles treatment. Quaint visions of little green men have long since been dispelled by the likes of E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and ALIENS 13.Any charm the property had was mainly due to the endearing relationship created between the late Bill Bixby as Tim and Ray Walston as the unworldly visitor. The conceit that Martians have antenna seemed dopey back then. Now it seems positively idiotic. Yet, Christopher Lloyds Uncle Martin sports the metallic appendages. In an early shot, the antenna on a sign for the TV station Tim works at is supposed to make us think martian! When is the last time you saw a TV with rabbit ears, eh?Disney does not trust quaint or relationships and crams this flick with youthwooing special effects that include a talking space suit named Zoot! Yes, you read that correctly  Uncle Martins silver space suit speaks. He is supposed to be a real hilarious cutup! Figure again. I got stretch socks that are funnier than Zoot. Whenever the action lags and it lags constantly, computer graphics are put into play to liven things up. Tim is here played by the amiable Jeff Daniels, who cannot or will not do anything to save this floudering mess. Zesty Christine Ebersole brings some comic zeal to her neighbor lady role. Even Ray Walston himself is dragged painfully into the procedings  all to no avail. This alien visitor is dead on arrival.Constant talk of sitcoms turning to screen makes me only hope that the I DREAM OF JEANNIE movie will not feature a talking harem outfit.

Although I am 17, I watched some of the series on YouTube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun. Sadly, this movie does little justice to the series.The special effects are rather substandard, and this was not helped by the flat camerawork. The script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour. Other films with underpar scripting are Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat, Thomas and the Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion.Now I will say I liked the idea of the story, but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early, and I am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy. And I was annoyed by the talking suit, despite spirited voice work from Wayne Knight.But the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah, all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels has pulled off some good performances before, but he did not seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing, and Elizabeth Hurleys character sadly came across as useless. Daryl Hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored, and I liked the idea of her being the love interest, but sadly you see very little of her,not to mention the Monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them likewise with Wallace Shawn as some kind of government operative. Christopher Lloyd acquits himself better, and as an actor I like Lloyd a lothe was in two of my favourite films Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I am fond of Back To The Future but he was given little to work with, and had a tendency to overact quite wildly.Overall, as much I wanted to like this movie, I was left unimpressed.

Instead, he is in inane comedies such as Dumb and Dumber.As for this picture, it fails because of the subject matter. At least, the television show brought about a variety of situations.

His manic portrayal of our beloved Uncle Martin is so unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminal.

Yet each has had no success in bigscreen offerings. This has also been true for other TV personalities  perhaps because many of the stories which are presented for two hours or so seem more suited to either a 10minute skit, or at most, the 22 or 23 minutes of drama during a halfhour program.This film, however, does not have one single element which would warrant two or three minutes of time on MAD TV, SNL, or anywhere else on a screen or stage.Its origination date is listed as 2002, but release date  to DVD only  is shown as 2004. It also was filmed not long before Rodney Dangerfields death, so its one redeeming value is that it probably provided at lease a few hundred thousand more dollars for his heirs.I would never heard of it, but found it when turningon my set, and frankly became fascinated by it.

The album is usually good enough to cement a legacy. However, when it comes to comedians, especially mainstream comics who star in their own vehicles, their final movie is usually God awful. John Belushi had Neighbors, John Candy had Wagons East, Chris Farley had Almost Heroes, Phil Hartman had Small Soldiers, and Rodney Dangerfield had this movie.Back By Midnight, although it may not have been Dangerfields very last film, is weak in every sense of the word. It wrapped filming in 2002 according to this website, and it is safe to say that it would have stayed on the shelves if Dangerfield was still alive. I have been a big fan of Dangerfields since I was in my early teens, and it pains me to see how rotten this film was.What amazes me the most is that a number of other talented people took part in a movie with a very weak premise to begin with. Dangerfield, a great comedian who usually played his comic persona on film, is a prison warden who houses a close knit group of inmates. When the owner of the prison, ColonelTomParkermeetsSamWalton billionaire Eli Rockwood Randy Quaid, cuts funding for the prison, the warden sends a group of inmates to break out of prison, rob Rockwoods eponymous convenience stores of consumer goods, and break back into prison with the loot. By taking what is in the convenience stores, they are I guess taking what they believe Rockwood owes them.With this flimsy premise, the movie sputters and stalls frequently. On top of that, the jokes that you think would be this movies salvation are not even close to funny, not even from Mr. No Respect himself. That is incredibly disappointing too, because you would expect a movie with Oscarnominated !!! Randy Quaid, Kirstie Alley, Gilbert Gottfried, Ed Begley Jr., Yeardley Smith, and others to be at least a little bit funny. Instead, Quaid plays a character we have seen before in countless other comedies, Alley plays a British heiress with an awful British accent could this movie not afford an actual British person!?!, and every joke was poorly set up and poorly timed by virtually every member of this ensemble. It was just not a good comedy in any sense of the word.Back By Midnight was rated R mainly for language and one scene of nudity. The irony in this fact is that many of the jokes are so audience insulting that even kids if you edit out the language would walk out of this film. The physical gags are also incredibly predictable, especially when Alleys pet monkey torments Quaids character. When the monkey grabs a pair of scissors and jumps on Quaids couch, who would not know where that gag was going?Being a directtovideo comedy, of course I did not expect any Oscarwinning material on here. The truth is, though, Dangerfield has made some great, timeless comedies before. Easy Money and Back To School are hilarious still, and were definitely not Oscarworthy in the slightest. However, there is a difference between making a dumb comedy that is funny, and making a dumb comedy. With the latter kind of comedy, it seems like the filmmakers do not even try, which is precisely the case with this lame excuse for a wasted 90 minutes. Rest in Peace, Rodney, but add this film to your batch of forgettable comedies like Meet Wally Sparks 1997 and The Godson 1999. This film, dare I say it, is not even worth seeing.","label":0},{"index":7515,"txt":"I do not know about you, but what I love about Tom and Jerry cartoons is the often violent interaction between the two characters.

Attempting to be a new millennium crosshybrid between On Golden Pond and The Prince of Tides, this film ends up being an erratic mess shifting so mercurially between comedy and melodrama that the emotional pitch always seems off. The main problem seems to be the irreconcilable difference between Garry Marshalls sentimental direction and Mark Andrus dark, rather confusing screenplay. The story focuses on the unraveling relationship between mother Lilly and daughter Rachel, who have driven all the way from San Francisco to smalltown Hull, Idaho where grandmother Georgia lives. The idea is for Lilly to leave Rachel for the summer under Georgias taskmaster jurisdiction replete with her draconian rules since the young 17year old has become an incorrigible hellion.The setup is clear enough, but the characters are made to shift quickly and often inexplicably between sympathetic and shrill to fit the contrived contours of the storyline. It veers haphazardly through issues of alcoholism, child molestation and dysfunctional families until it settles into its pat resolution. The three actresses at the center redeem some of the dramatic convolutions but to varying degrees. Probably due to her offscreen reputation and her scratchy smokers voice, Lindsay Lohan makes Rachels promiscuity and manipulative tactics palpable, although she becomes less credible as her character reveals the psychological wounds that give a reason for her hedonistic behavior. Felicity Huffman is forced to play Lilly on two strident notes  as a petulant, resentful daughter to a mother who never got close to her and as an angry, alcoholic mother who starts to recognize her own accountability in her daughters state of mind. She does what she can with the role on both fronts, but her efforts never add up to a fleshandblood human being.At close to seventy, Jane Fonda looks great, even as weatherbeaten as she is here, and has the star presence to get away with the cartoonlike dimensions of the flinty Georgia. The problem I have with Fondas casting is that the legendary actress deserves far more than a series of oneliners and maternal stares. Between this and 2005s execrable MonsterinLaw, it does make one wonder if her best work is behind her. It should come as no surprise that the actresses male counterparts are completely overshadowed. Garrett Hedlund looks a little too surferdude as the na\u00efve Harlan, a devout Mormon whose sudden love for Rachel could delay his twoyear missionary stint. Cary Elwes plays on a familiar suspicious note as Lillys husband, an unfortunate case where predictable casting appears to telegraph the movies ending.There is also the omnipresent Dermot Mulroney in the morose tripleplay role of the wounded widower, Lillys former flame and Rachels new boss as town veterinarian Dr. Simon Ward. Laurie Metcalf has a barelythere role as Simons sister Paula, while Marshall regular Hector Elizondo and songsmith Paul Williams show up in cameos. Some of Andrus dialogue is plain awful and the wavering seriocomic tone never settles on anything that feels right. There are several small extras with the 2007 DVD, none all too exciting. Marshall provides a commentary track that has plenty of his trademark laconic humor. There are several deleted scenes, including three variations on the ending, and a gag reel. A sevenminute makingof featurette is included, as well as the original theatrical trailer, a sixminute short spotlighting the three actresses and a fiveminute tribute to Marshall.","label":0},{"index":7518,"txt":"I am only rating this film as a 3 out of pity because it attempts to be worthwhile.

The most important thing in a film is a good STORY. This story is weak and never develops just because the subject matter is deep, does not mean the story is good. A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one that experiences a major character change, and is primed for that change over the course of the movie. In Georgia Rule, the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped. Secondly, there were too many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters. Pulling off a really good dynamic character is a tough job and takes time you have only got a couple hours in a movie. That means that too many attempted dynamic characters will get too little attention to their personal change. Even if I ignore the poorly written story, and the litter of weak dynamic characters, I cannot even say I liked anyone. Every character was a mess. That is fine if yourre writing American Beauty but not when you are attempting a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a horrible mother, her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being no I am not cutting her any slack because she was molested, crap happens to everyone and we are all responsible for our own actions. The Dudley Do Right Mormon kid should have had the guts not to compromise his religion and commitments...and Simon, I mean seriously, what kind of guy lets a 17 year old girl who is been molested just stay over occasionally unless he is an actor or a politician.

The whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp, what? out loud at least 710 times throughout its grueling two hour course.Advertised in its trailer as a movie about three generations of women  Jane Fonda as the matriarch, Felicity Huffman as her daughter, and Lindsay Lohan as the rebellious, over sexed, scantily clad granddaughter, the viewer thinks this will be a clich\u00e9, light, chickflick about growing up and coming together as a family.Talk about false advertisement at it worst.After many shots of animals doing funny things in the background of pivotal scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes into a doctors office weekly to have her diaper changed, or the fact that this movie is actually about Lindsay Lohans character being sexually abused by her stepfather, Georgia Rule creates its own genre of cinema  The ungrounded, horribly acted, inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most awkward, surreal, strange way. If Garry Marshall wanted this movie to be a dramacomedy, then he should have watched The Royal Tenenbaums. Sideways. Junebug. And so on. And so on.The only way I feel I can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that Georgia Rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation. Say that the movie, The 40 Year Old Virgin, was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child. But instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn, belly laughs and comedy would ensue, with all of the characters reactions being that of fake, lifeless, human beings pretending to care. Throw in a yellow parakeet, Dermot Mulroney as the flattest, most nondimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script, along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy, tootanned girl who shares none of the same interests as he, as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene, unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other, and you have got Georgia Rule.I found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers, screenwriters, actors, editors, etc..who have a lot more talent and are not getting noticed.Do not see this movie  my rule.

Within the first ten minutes of the film, I grew extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to salvage itself, for me at least, that it was going to have to pull itself out of the enormous hole it had dug. Unfortunately, that did not occur. The two draws of the movie for me were to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I do not know enough about Lindsey Lohans work to have been interested in what she would bring to the film. Afterward, I just felt disappointed in and for all three of them even though there were moments in each of their performances. I imagine that for each of them to find their moments was a very difficult task given the fact that there was an amazing lack of character development and uninspired dialog. Although the plot is an interesting one, the movie on the whole is so poorly written, directed and edited that anybodys performance as an actor would suffer and be tainted by it. The disrespectful way in which it dealt with sexual abuse and the trite and insulting viewpoint of smalltown America, I think, were the two main reasons why this film failed in hitting it is mark. As one reviewer has noted and I would agree, the movie is almost impossible to market given it is finished form. I suspect that, or at least hope that for the actors sakes anyway there are some real gems on the cutting room floor. Sad for us but if that is true then the actors can take solace in that and feel somewhat good about lending their talents and time to such a flop. Oh yeah and another thing...I wished for just once I could go see an American movie which included the sadly disappearing but wonderfully bucolic settings such as the one in this film where the main characters were not absentmindedly andor disrespectfully littering the country side with pop cans, smashed CDs and, other such trash!","label":0},{"index":7527,"txt":"The problem with family dramas is that, outside of TV movies on channels like Lifetime, most people do not want to watch them.

Particularly with the young crowd that would be Miss Lohans fan base or the younger crowd that tends to make movies not simply popular but financially successful for studios.The specific problems I had with this movie is the cartoonishness of some of the characterizations. It was a bit much to blame all of the Lohans characters actingout wrecking the car, drug use, etc. on what her stepfather did to her. While not improbable,it is just a bit much to expect the audience to swallow. Additionally, other aspects, such as her giving the young Morman boy, oral sex, or that she would actually make a good assistant to the vet, who coincidentally happens to have a thing for her mother, etc., all these elements just did not really help this movie along.

How much longer? to fill in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require about three more hours of narrative and character development  especially given the fact that the film we do have is just so slow and takes itself just so seriously.That is staggering; what could the Halperins have possibly been trying to accomplish here? Their previous film, White Zombie, was a successful low budget attempt to duplicate the early Universal Studios monster films The Mummy, Dracula, etc., and as such stuck pretty close to the zombie mythology that those in North America would know from popular magazines.Revolt of the Zombies, to the contrary, appears to have been intended as some allegory for the politics of modern war. This would not only explain the opening, and the change of Dean Jaggers character into a megalomaniac, but it also explains why the zombies do not actually do much in the film, besides stand around, look frightening, and wait for orders  they are just allegorical soldiers, not the undead cannibals we have all come to love and loathe in zombie films.I am the equal to any in my dislike for modern war and its politics  but I think a film ought to be entertaining first, and only later, maybe, educational.

This is an interesting concept for a movie, and was done much more effectively by Fritz Lang in his series of Dr. Mabuse films, including Dr. Mabuse the Gambler 1922 and The Testament of Dr. Mabuse 1933. Here it is unfortunately subordinated to his quest to regain the love of his former fianc\u00e9e, Claire Duvall played by the Anne Heche look alike with a bad hairdo, Dorothy Stone which is really the major theme.The movie has an intriguing beginning, as Louque is sent on a military archaeological expedition to Cambodia to end the cult of zombies that came from there. At some type of compound where we get great 30s sets and clothes he announces his engagement to Claire, and then barely five minutes later, she gives him back his ring declaring her love for his pal, Clifford Greyson Robert Noland. It is unintentionally funny the way they talk to each other without making eye contact. This would have been a great movie for Mystery Science Theater 3000, if they had not already roasted it.It is never shown how Louque actually learns the zombification secret, but he then uses it to kill his enemies, create a giant army of rifle carrying soldiers and body guards. We will not see such sheer force of will until John Agar in The Brain From Planet Arous 1957.Finally Claire consents to marry him if he will let Greyson live and return to America. Louque agrees, but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves. On their wedding night he realizes that Claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his powers. To gain her love, he does so, causing the revolt of the title, in which all his slaves awaken and attack his compound and kill him. Greyson embraces Claire, and we seem to be at the end of a parable Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad. So really then, it is not that bad of a film, despite the low IMDb rating it currently has. On repeated viewings ? one can see the artistry in the well formed script! Dean Jagger had yet to develop into a good actor, and is almost unrecognizable in his youngness  is that really his own hair? We remember him more for his bald, old man roles in White Christmas 1954, X The Unknown 1956 and King Creole 1958. The story borrows a lot of its basic themes from the Halperin brothers better, earlier film White Zombie 1932 in which hapless Robert Frazier as Charles Beaumont uses zombification to win the love of Madge Bellamy as Madeline Parker.If you want real zombie movies of which there are hundreds! I would start with White Zombie 1932, King of the Zombies 1941, I Walked with a Zombie 1943, Night of the Living Dead 1968, The Last Man on Earth 1964 and its two remakes. In the modern era of classy films, there are Horror Express 1972, The Serpent and the Rainbow 1988, 28 Days Later 2002 and its sequel, as well as many, many, others too numerous to mention.This one is not really a zombie film. Judging this movie on its own terms, it is more of a semiGothic romance. As such it ranks a little below some of Universals bottom billed B horror movies of the late 30s and early 40s. So I will give it a 5.","label":0},{"index":7542,"txt":"Wimpy stuffed shirt Armand Louque blandly played by veteran character actor Dean Jagger in a rare lead role joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies. Armand falls for the lovely Claire Duval fetching blonde Dorothy Stone, who uses the meek sap to get Armands colleague Clifford Grayson the hopelessly wooden Robert Noland to marry her. Furious over being used and spurned by Claire, Armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge. Sound exciting? Well, it sure as not. For starters, Victor Halperins static nondirection lets the meandering and uneventful talkridden story plod along at an excruciatingly slow pace. Worse yet, Halperin crucially fails to bring any tension, atmosphere and momentum to the hideously tedious proceedings. The mostly blah acting from a largely insipid cast does not help matters any; only George Cleveland as the hearty General Duval and E. Alyn Warren as the irascible Dr. Trevissant manage to enliven things a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionics. The drippy stock film library score, the painfully obvious stagebound sets, and the crude cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive as well. In fact, this feeble excuse for a fright feature is so crummy that not even the uncredited starkly staring eyes of the great Bela Lugosi can alleviate the brainnumbing boredom. A dismally dull dud.","label":0},{"index":7543,"txt":"After eagerly waiting to the end, I have to say I wish I would not have joined the whole series at the first place.

Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crewmemebers were dying all along the journey. Why she wants to save Seven of Nine only? The others do not count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them. As the say, journey is more important than the destination. Unbelievable.

How was a society that created these ultimate warrior fighting machines ever defeated in the first place? That is the question you will be pondering if you take time to watch Revolt Of The Zombies. Towards the end of World War I, the French discover a cult from occupied Cambodia where these undead creatures who cannot be stopped with bullets form a brigade of monks who go over the top and dislodge the Hun.This scares the living fecal matter out of everyone concerned so an international expedition is formed to find out destroy the secret of these zombies so no nation can get their hands on it and rule the world.But we have got some dissent in those ranks. First is Snidely Whiplash villain Roy DArcy who murders the Buddhist monk who has the secret and second is Dean Jagger. Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac as we all know and he is determined to woo Dorothy Stone away from rival Robert Noland.I think you have got some idea how this comes out, especially since a race of zombies did not conquer the world for one country. Dean Jagger as he got the Oscar for Twelve Of the clock High must have shuddered every time he thought about this film and the awful dialog he tried to give a spark of sincerity to.Moral of the story, you might make an ultimate warrior with the zombie potion and the zombie chant, but you cannot make an ultimate love slave.","label":0},{"index":7545,"txt":"Ever since the cinemaloving universe made acquaintance with a guy named George A. Romero, the word zombie automatically gets associated with bloodsoaked horror images and nonstop acting sequences. It is safe to say that his Night of the Living Dead formed the zombie movie as we know it now. Yet, in the earliest years of cinema, the premise of reanimated corpses was merely used in slow, nearly actionless psychological thrillers. Jacques Tourneurs I walked with a Zombie is a perfect example and so is White Zombie, starring Bela Lugosi. This Revolt of the Zombies could have been another example but unfortunately it is a failure over the entire line and easily one of the most tedious movies I ever saw. Dreadful acting, a very poorly written screenplay and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension! The film only lasts 65 minutes and yet the first half hour is entirely wasted on stupid lovestory intrigues and unexciting monologues. The setting in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor surely could have resulted in a more compelling story but all we ever see are interior shots. The lead actress Dorothy Stone, textbook blonde with curly hair and an ugly nose irritated me enormously and I kept hoping a ravenous undead would suddenly appear out of nowhere to devour her. Unlucky again\u0085. If you manage to struggle yourself through 60 soporific minutes, you will be rewarded with a fairly decent finale. Still, this is far too little to give this film a positive rating, let alone a recommendation. Avoid! This is the type of movie you should only see in case you already saw everything else.","label":0},{"index":7546,"txt":"Well, first off, if you are checking out Revolt of the Zombies as some very early Night of the Living Dead 1968type film, forget it. This is about zombies in a more psychological sense, where that term merely denotes someone who is not in control of their will, but who must instead follow the will of another. The zombies here, as little as they are in the film, are largely metaphors for subservience to the state or authority in general, as in wartime. It is quite a stretch to call this a horror film.The film is set during World War I. A French Cambodian contingent had heard strange stories about zombificationsupposedly Angkor Wat was built by utilizing zombiesand there are tales of zombie armies easily overcoming foes. Armand Louque Dean Jagger brings back a priest who supposedly knows the secret of zombification, but he will not talk. So Louque and an international military contingent head to Angkor Wat on an archaeological expedition designed to discover the secret of zombification and destroy the information before zombies have a chance to wipe out the white race.One of the odd things about Revolt of the Zombies is that it seems like maybe writerdirector Victor Halperin decided to change his game plan while shooting the script. The film begins as if it will explore the zombiemilitary metaphor, and maybe even have adventure elements, but after about 15 minutes, it changes gears and becomes more of a love triangle story.Halperin does stick with a subtext about will and power and a Nietzschean will to power. The film is interesting on that level, but the script and the editing are very choppy. This is yet another older film for which I would not be surprised if there is missing footage, especially since some scenes even fade or cut while a character is uttering dialogue.Amidst the contrived romance story, Halperin tries to keep referring to the zombie thread, but little of the zombie material makes much sense. Louque discovers the secret of zombification, but it does not mean much to the viewer. The mechanics of the zombie material are vague and confusing\u0097Halperin even resorts to using superimposed footage of Bela Lugosis googlyeyes from his 1932 film, White Zombie, but never explains what it has to do with anything. There are big gaps in the plot, including the love story. Promising, interesting characters from early reels disappear for long periods of time. One potential villain is disposed of unceremoniously before he gets to do much.If you are a big fan of old, creaky B movies, Revolt of the Zombies may be worth watching at least oncethe acting is not all that bad, and if you have got a good imagination, you can piece together an interesting story in your mind to fill in all of the gaps. But this is the second time I have seen the film, with the first only being about five years ago, and I could barely recall anything about itso it is not exactly memorable.","label":0},{"index":7547,"txt":"Seriously, I absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity but I just watched this for the first time last night and it easily slotted itself into my bottom five of all time. Was this supposed to be about the love story or the zombies??? This movie was so bad that after it mercifully ended all I could do is laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was. Thankfully I am too anal to turn a movie off without seeing the entire thing or I would not be able to brag about watching this all the way through in one sitting! I like to think something positive can be said about anything in life so in keeping with that theory I will acknowledge this films most positive asset, it was very short for a full length film.","label":0},{"index":7548,"txt":"While this film certainly does possess the stench of a bad film, it is surprisingly watchable on several levels. First, for old movie fans, it is interesting to see the leading role played by Dean Jagger no relation to Mick. While Jagger later went on to a very respectable role as a supporting actor even garnering the Oscar in this category for 12 Of the clock HIGH, here his performance is truly unique since he actually has a full head of hair I never saw him this way before and because he was by far the worst actor in the film. This film just goes to show that if an actor cannot act in his earlier films does not mean he cannot eventually learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first movie THE SILVER CHALICE is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s.A second reason to watch the film is the shear cheesiness of it all. The writing is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and an unnamed Cambodian are wading through the water, it is obvious they are really just walking in place and the background is poorly projected behind them. Plus, once they leave the water, their costumes are 100 dry!!! Horrid continuity and mindlessly bad dialog abounds throughout the filmso much so that it is hard to imagine why they did not ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to star in the filmsince both of them starred in many gradez horror films. In many ways, this would be a perfect example for a film class on how NOT to make a film.So, while giving it a 3 is probably a bit overgenerous, it is fun to laugh at and short so it is worth a look for bad film fans.","label":0},{"index":7549,"txt":"Revolt of the Zombies proves that having the same director revamp and recycle an idea does not necessarily make lightning strike twice.The Halperin brothers, responsible for the horror classic White Zombie, made this trite piece of garbage a mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled closeups of Lugosis eyes from that previous film. There was a court battle with the White Zombie films rights owners, who did not want the Halperins to be able to use the word zombie in this title. That word was the only thing that could help this film, because, as everyone knows, bad films can make much more money simply by having the word Zombie appear in the title. Knowing what Victor Halperin was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting. It seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle. The zombies here seem not to be true walking dead, but simply hypnotism victims.Wanna create a mindcontrolled army of zombies? Be ready to crack a few eggs, including your own.THE LAME PLOT Man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend, whom she loves, jealous. This sends man into a spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mindcontrol techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who is not worth spit.This includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments I have ever seen. You would have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming. The acting is not even good. This movie makes the racially insensitive King of the Zombies which appeared on the same double bill DVD I bought seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic. It makes the atomic age scifi alien zombie cheese fest Invisible Invaders seem like a serious drama. This is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a Korean film fan twitch South Korean films are often known for their use of melodrama.

Halperin, the George A.

Also, a love interest for the evil man.Where this film really excels is in the imagery. The Cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and the zombie look very powerful in their large numbers. Unfortunately, we do not really get to see much of the zombies in action and the love story seems to play a much too large role for a horror film though this has a valid plot reason later on.I would have loved to see some 1930s zombies attack helpless city folk, but this film just did not deliver. And no strong villain like Bela Lugosi was waiting to do battle against our heroes. And the use of Lugosis eyes? A nice effect, but misleading as he is never in the film... why not recreate this with the new actors eyes? Overall, a film that could be a great one with a little script reworking and could someday be a powerful remake especially if they keep it in the same postwar time frame.

There is actually a pretty good scene at the start of a soldier firing off his pistol into a horde of approaching zombie soldiers... and a closeup of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them. The effect looks hopelessly fake these days but in 1936 I am sure it had audiences gasping. The story concerns the search for the secret of mind control... ostensibly to create an unstoppable zombie army... but later as a means for one character to win the woman he loves. The movie is barely an hour long but moves at a snails pace so it seems featurelength, believe me! There really is not much to recommend it... you may get some amusement from the faked studio shots of the star wading through a swamp. The ending is interesting... so I would say the movie is worth seeing at least once. More than likely you will see it as an extra feature on some cheap 4 movies on 1 DVD compilation at WalMart for five bucks. Hey, it is well worth the money...","label":0},{"index":7552,"txt":"Though the title includes the word zombies, this film is not what you would expect from a movie made today, though for 1936 the concept is played out about as well as would probably be expected. Dean Jagger portrays Armand Louque, an officer in the French Army of World War I, who has stumbled upon an ancient tale of soldiers turned into automatons, or zombies, who are impervious in battle and may hold the key to victory in the war, though on whose side is not certain. At first he has trouble convincing his superiors of this phenomenon, but eventually French General Duval George Cleveland orders a non military expedition into the ancient Cambodian city of Angkor to find the secret of the zombies and destroy it.The story is played out against the backdrop of a love triangle involving Louque, Duvals daughter Claire Dorothy Stone, and Clifford Grayson Robert Noland, all a part of the expedition. When Louque laments over his lack of forcefulness and resolve, Grayson offers him advice to go after what he wants in life with all his power. That advice begins to transform Louque, particularly after he is successful in obtaining a stone tablet resembling a photo from the ancient city. Having followed a temple priest into a swamp, Louque now appears to hold the secret he had been seeking, though it is not made clear how he has instantaneously been able to command the power of zombiefication. All it takes is placing his right fist to the forehead simulating a third eye, and casting his thoughts out to those he wishes to control. This comes in handy for winning back his girl, and taking Graysons early advice as he comments to his servant, Buna, we are learning to be ruthless.Fans of early B horror flicks will recognize the use of Bela Lugosis signature eye stare, plucked from the 1932 film White Zombie, also from director Victor Halperin. Of the two movies, White Zombie is preferably superior, both in story content and in it is depiction of the undead, where the zombies have a more sinister appearance and are more threatening. In Revolt, the zombies are enemy soldiers with a glazed over look that merely react to their mentors commands. In fact, the actual revolt of the title occurs only when Louque releases the soldiers from his mental command in deference to his love for Claire; they overrun his compound and kill him in the process.Not to be too harsh on the film, it plays out decently within the parameters of it is story outline, but if you are thinking zombies!!! within the traditional context, you will probably be disappointed. If you want to sample an early treatment of the subject, the aforementioned White Zombie with Bela Lugosi is the way to go.","label":0},{"index":7553,"txt":"This might mean the end of the white race! gasps a general as a dozen Native Zombies wander around the battlefields of Europe during the Great War.

Even by 1936 standards the acting in this film is bad. From a previous decade. It looks like it came out of a correspondence school text book on How to Act  Chapter Three Emotions How to express fear and loathing Female Clench both fists. Place fist of one hand on heart.

The film is pretty much the same in plot and execution as Darkman 2, but I was mostly irritated by the presence of many scenes from Darkman 2. These sequels were made in short time and with little money, so these kind of decisions had to be made. Couple of scenes are pretty stylish and exiting, but still this is pretty tired film and often irritatingly stupid, too. The characters scream and laugh too much and it is very annoying. There is no any philosophical depth in the film, and this is like a remake of Darkman 2 which it still cannot equal. Darkman 2 had many great scenes and stylish camera work, and Larry Drakes ability to play great villain. Darkman 3 offers only some nice scenes and moments, but mostly this film is tired and full of cliches. The few positive things in this movie are flashback edits Westlakes nightmares and couple of truly surprising plot turns and tricks. And worth mentioning is also pretty nasty death scene of the main villain which was pretty comic book like and inventive without any gore. Far more interesting than the death of main villain in part two. Darkman 3 is worst in the whole series, and we must remember that these two sequels were made directly to video and they do not come even close to Raimis original Darkman with Liam Neeson. Darkman 2 was okay actioner with plenty of great scenes and suspense, but this last ? entry is tired and often stupid and boring piece of sequel.

Yes, Darkman III Die Darkman Die is quite the handful when it comes to cheap cashins on the success of a previous film.This time around, the disfigured antihero Peyton Westlake aka, Darkman; portrayed by Mummy actor Arnold Vosloo locks horns with evil crimelord and lousy husband Peter Rooker played in a brilliantly overthetop performance by Jeff Fahey, and over the course of the 87 minute film grows to develop an affection for Rookers wife and daughter, once again learning to care for another person.Blah. Blah. Blah.This film is basically just a silly way for the studio to make some more money off of Sam Raimis original film, which I consider to be a great actionsuspense film.Oh yeah, and there are also a number of silly subplots, including a villainess who supposedly was one of the original doctors to save Darkman following his scarring, and her seducing our hero into thinking she is an ally before revealing her nefarious plot to help Rooker create more superhuman powered thugs like Darkman. Apparently, she cannot just do the same procedure on the thugs that she performed on Darkman. Why? I cannot really explain it, because the movie certainly does not.There is also an assassination subplot involving a District Attourney who is threatening to bring down Rookers organization, and some other very silly things going on.But it does not really add up. This film feels like two or three episodes of a television show edited together more than an actual film. The direction alternates between pretty good and downright sloppy a scene where Darkman rides his trainlike vehicle and dodges a rocketlauncher is just plain silly, and the editing is a mixedbag. The film just moves too quickly for anyone to really care what is going on. And without spoiling it, the final 15 minutes of this movie, and indeed, the entire series is just kinda... I dunno... Another 15 minutes of mixedbag footage.In fact, commenting on the editing, one of my favorite things in this film is watching for footage reused from the previous films, and then looking for footage within this film that is repeated multiple times. Yes, it is that cheap. It is one thing to do a recap at the beginning of the film, and maybe repeat a shot or two, but in the sheer volume they do it minutes of footage repeated from previous films, it is just sloppy and amateurish.Also, I have to say that Darkmans psychedelic montage freakouts are a bit overdone in this film.

Here, there are at least four or five, and they feel very abrupt and outofplace.That being said, the film is not without some good points. A few action scenes are welldone. The clich\u00e9 story of Darkman yearning for a real life works suitably for a directtoDVD feature. Some of the acting is nice, particularly from Rookers wife, portrayed by the beautiful Roxann Dawson. Also, while no Danny Elfman, composer Randy Miller composes some nice music that builds off of Elfmans original themes.But overall, the film is too quick, cheap and silly to be taken seriously. Arnold Vosloo seems alternatively bored and exuberant from scene to scene, and Fahey, while a joy to watch as an overthetop villain, just does not quite fit in with the series.Like Darkman II, I would recommend this to fans of the original, who will surely get a laugh.

The strange thing about Jill The Ripper or Jill Rips...or Tied Up is that I honestly think they seriously thought they were making a provocative and serious thriller? It shows in the way that they describe it on IMDb, on the DVD case, in the commentaries, and this film is not serious. To call it campy would be a huge understatement. The film tries to be complex and intelligent when in fact it is nothing more than shallow, confusing and gratuitous. On top of that they put Lundgren, who is known for action films, in an attempt at a serious role which makes it even more campy because his range as an actor is pretty limited. The entire film revolves around the kinky sex world and yet they attempt at making it a serious thriller? Just the plot and premise immediately make it a BMovie Porn at very best.Dolph Lundgren plays disgraced former cop and raging alcoholic Matt Sorenson who decides to play Detective when his brother is murdered. I mean put aside the numerous plot holes that has Lundgren getting free roam to investigate crime scenes, and witnesses and everything else even though he is not a cop anymore and you still have a pretty strange and rather lack luster performance from Lundgren. Danielle Brett is Lundgrens eventual love interest and his brothers widow. Brett plays her role decently enough considering the script and campy story. The supporting cast is huge and no one particularly stands out in their performances unless it is on the negative side such as the absolutely horrible performance by Victor Pedtrchenko who seems to go by several different names in the film, boasts an awful accent and is a really awful villain.I honestly tried to get into the mystery and film and watch closely but there was not any reason to because it was all a jumble of ridiculous plot and gratuitous sex games including a downright ridiculously hilarious scene where Lundgren goes under cover and is strung upside down nearly naked. To explain how classy and well done this movie is sarcasm...sarcasm the back of the DVD I picked up it was really cheap has Lundgrens character listed as Murray Wilson not the name of his character in the film. While somehow Lundgren manages to be usually watchable the film falls flat on it is face trying to be serious.

First of all, the old saying You cannot judge a book by it is cover applies here. The box for this flick seems to indicate that Jill is the stone fox with long hair with highlights. The back of the box has a cool shot of the redleather Jill and some other shots. The description makes you want to rent the movie because it SOUNDS good. You start watching it and suddenly you find out that the movie takes place inexplicably in 1977. Jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover. The movie is not quite as predictable as you would think...and that is not a good thing. Characters do so many stupid things without any modicum of motivation...it is embarrassing to watch. 10 minutes before the end of the movie Dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason. Also, what was the point of having Dolph kill this other lady in cold blood who had been helping him. Anthony Hickox the director should have seen a stinker when he read the script.

That said the material gives Lundgren nothing to work with, in fact, Lundgren is completely left out to dry in a dreary thriller which is both predictable and incomprehensible. CoStar Danielle Brett is also good, in fact the film works best when it centers around the chemistry of Lundgren and Brett, indeed had the film taken the time to explore their relationship the film would have been fairly decent. However the movie is lackluster, the action is nonexistent, the plot not given enough exploration Too much boring B.S around Lundgrens investigation of his brothers employer and the film is needlessly gory and ridiculous.

This film is horrible and one of the very few Gojira films I cant stand to watch again the other being G. vs Megalon.The plot is too campy to be in the Heisei series, a series that attempted to turn the aging Godzilla franchise into bonafide action films, revolving around ideas that seemed more in place in 1974 than 1991. It just sounded ridiculous, especially with some of the subject matter, take for example the WW2 scene, with the Japanese soldiers praising a dying Godzillasaurus, a mournful and serious tone, take the exuberant former commander turn capitalist and his death, serious seens in a film its fans somehow denote as played for laughs, as a goofy romp with guilty illogical fun, if so than this is easily one of the most tasteless films I have seen, however I think its more likely it was only talent the filmmakers lacked and this was a case of a straight faced action movie gone bad. It was made ever worse by the fact that the special effects are terrible beyond compare, from the jet packs to the android, to the hokey sound effects emitted from everything, its impossible to take anything seriously, and yet the film expects you to, there is no nudges to the camera.Like nearly all Godzilla films there is a pointless romance, and this is no exception, though something can be said about the fact that this one is especially pointless since and inexplicable. There is literally no reason at all presented for the romance, it just happens and there lives make 360 degree commitments for it. Aside from this the other terrible aspect of this film is dialogue, both the Japanese and English is horrible, clunky and possibly the inspiration for Battlefield Earth.The Tristar DVD compounds the problems, making everything look grainy, blurred, dim and just plain ugly, the same was for the sound. I first saw the Japanese Region 2 version and the differences are night and day, with the original vibrant colors and texture, the noteworthy score, the fight scenes especially, are actually watchable.In my opinion, the Heisei series is a disappointment, with the exception of Godzilla 1984 Japanese version there is little to praise here, and Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah is case in point of this failure.

The help is questionable, as all these 1992 citizens do is go back to 1944 to watch some closedcircuit TV, but, hey, they shot the script. You would think that by the 90s the Japanese would know better than to trust people in spaceships. Fortunately for Nippon, the white guys  you can tell they are American because they say nucyaler  erred by bringing back in time the one Japanese girl left in the future.

In a surprise revelation, we are informed that King Ghidorah was created from some hand puppets left too long in the microwave. Godzilla also does his share of demolition as the movie winds down.

We do not keep it in Japanese waters  with which to jumpstart a new Godzilla from the bones of an old dinosaur. Only they do not have to, because a leaky old nuclear shipwreck has already made Godzilla whole again. Oh, and Godzilla finally gets to Tokyo, reuniting with his old army buddy in a heartwarming moment of tearful recognition. They look into each others eyes, and Godzilla nods as if to say, Gotta do it, man. The tycoon nods in understanding. Then Godzilla blows him up.I should also mention here that, in order to prevent Godzillas revamped angry self from fulfilling his destiny and destroying Japan, the Japanese girl from the future goes BACK to the future to ask for help from  yes  a balding white man. Probably because he pities her as the sole Asian character from the 23d century, he agrees to build a MechaGhidora and send it back to the 1990s, so that together, these two giant monsters can, uh, fulfill Godzillas destiny and destroy Japan. In a wonderful nod to those notoriously selfwilled whipping heads, the girl piloting MechaGhidora has trouble controlling the joystick.This Godzilla suit design owes much to the Sumo  his thighs are flabby enough to double for Rush Limbaughs, and his belly and chest are thick and ponderous. But there is more exploding masonry in this picture than in most of his adventures, which makes up for a lot. Also features a man with a passing resemblance to Robert Patrick playing a killer robot. Yes, in the future even the robots will have bald spots. Plus Megumi Odaka, reprising her role as Micki, the only Japanese girl ever born with ears larger than her Disney namesake and an acting style even bigger than that.

But the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the 60s it is amazing that one of them does not go to the Rolling Stones gig at Altamont, making it seem less like a period drama and more like a Cliff Notes version of the decade.The makers rush through it so much that there is little or no time to give the characters any character, with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time  the childrens father is especially clich\u00e9d  and then when they are back on BLAMMO! it is something else. Garry Trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly. In fairness, Jerry OConnell, Jordana Brewster, Jeremy Sisto, Julia Stiles and Charles S. Dutton give their material the old college try, but they are wasted especially the latter two; it is undeniably good to see David Alan Grier in a rare straight role as activist Fred Hampton, and Rosanna Arquette in an uncredited cameo in part 2 is always welcome.What is not welcome is how The 60s drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect and this may well be the only time an American TV presentation about post60s America never mentions the British Invasion  no Beatles, no Rolling Stones... then again, there is only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album, right?. Capping its surfaceskimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost outofplace happy ending, American Dreams and The Wonder Years did it all much, much better.

But there lies also some of the problems of this picture. It strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged. So it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic  Man To Man does not let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head. Joseph Fiennes exemplifies this in his role he does his best to look concerned, genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer. Add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that Man To Man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to defend it it is entertaining, has some humorous scenes and the showstealing Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like The Elephant Man David Lynch but you will be leaving the theatre satisfied.

One exception is the novel entitled The Lad and the Lion, brought to the screen as The Lion Man 1936, an overtalkative, static, oldhat, slowmoving and rather dull movie, despite being filmed on real desert locations. Actually movie is the wrong word. The narrative does not move but proceeds at a snails pace in an abrupt series of jerks. For instance, at least five characters are given elaborate opening scenes and then just disappear. Even more frustrating for the keen movie fan, are the characters who make an impression of sorts like the lass who plies Hall with drugged wine but are enacted by players who are not credited! The credited thespians generally come off worse than the unknowns. One exception is Australian actress Finis Barton who gives a good account of the kidnapped harem girl who rescues young Master Fairy. Admittedly, most of the cast are saddled with atrocious King James dialogue which has to be heard to be believed! But the way to play this rubbish is tongueincheek, a stratagem which does not seem to have occurred to a single one of the films roster of notalent players. Maybe director J.P. McCarthy scotched that idea. Anyway, it is sad to see the lovely Kathleen Burke forced to trade lines with the likes of Richard Carlyle her dad and Jon Hall her suitor.

I remember dialogue from Tatum ONeal that was just amazingly bad. I remember Richard Burtons character looking so hopelessly lost, and then remembering how his motivations did not translate to me. In short, I remember Circle of Two because it was so phenomenally awful.This movie came out at a time when America was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality. Recall The Blue Lagoon and other Brooke Shields annoyances, Lipstick, Little Darlings, Beau Pere and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex, particularly with adults. As a teenager during this time, I found the obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the 70s and 80s, made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out, so to speak.Circle of Two is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient, like Blue Lagoon. In fact, it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave, if totally failed, way. But honestly, it is one of those films you will never see if you did not see it on its first run because it was so truly awful.

And now, God knows why, she is in the game again. Basic Instinct 2 is the sequel to the smashhit erotica Basic Instinct featuring a sexy Stone and a vulnerable Michael Douglas. However, fans of the original might not even get close to this one, since Instinct 2 is painful filmmaking, as the mediocre director Michael CatonJones assassinates the legacy of the first film.The plot of the movie starts when a car explosion breaks in right at the beginning. Catherine Tramell Sharon Stone, trying to look forcefully sexy is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder. A psychiatrist a horrible David Morrisey is appointed to examine her, but eventually falls for an intimate game of seduction.And there it is, without no further explanations, the basic force that moves this Instinct. Nothing much is explained and we have to sit through a sleazy, Cclass erotic film. Sharon Stone stars in her first role where she is most of the time a turnoff. Part of it because of the amateurish writing, the careless direction, and terrifyingly low chemistry. The movie is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality a menage a trois scene was cut off so that this would not be rated NC17 than the first entrance in the series. Instinct is a compelling torture.To top it off, everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the film. The acting here is really bad. Sharon Stone has some highlights, but here, she gets extremely obnoxious. David Morrisey stars in the worst role of his life, and seems to never make more than two expressions in the movie confused and aroused. Instinct 2 is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series, that managed to put in thriller with erotica extremely well. Paul Verhoeven, how I miss you....Basic Instinct 2 never sounded like a good movie, and, indeed, it is not.

A forbidden love between a sixty year old painter Ashleigh Richard Burton and a fifteen year old girl Sarah Norton Tatum ONeill; and the question of whether such a relationship is acceptable given societys standards. The problem with Circle of Two, however, is that it fails to live up to its promise. Director Jules Dassin and Hedley should have put more thought into the screenplay. When I watched this film, I expected to learn something new about love and sexuality. Instead, I got boring dialogue, a pointless lecture on art, outings where Sarah seemed to have more fun away from Ashleigh, and a closing scene so artificial that its emotional impact was lost. This script makes good actors look bad. So one can imagine how the films problems were compounded even further with the largely amateurish cast that Jules Dassin assembled. Tatum ONeill was not in her element. I did not believe for a second that her character Sarah was in love with Ashleigh. Her performance seemed superficial, like a contestant at a beauty pageant. It was as though she forced herself to be happy, when the script required her to be happy, and to be sad, when the script asked her to be sad. The only scene I liked with her in was at the very end when she said nothing at all. That was probably the closest Tatums Sarah Norton ever came to being real. But Tatum was not the only one at fault. Richard Burtons Ashleigh lacked the charm, the charisma and the complexity to attract even women of his own age, let alone a fifteen year old. The rest of the cast was also dismal. Even their arguing was unconvincing, because they waited to take turns. Who does that? Michael Wincott as the jealous exboyfriend Paul was probably the best thing in this film, but his role was small. To be fair to the actors, Dassins direction let everyone down; but it is also true that a great movie goes beyond the script. Kubricks Lolita did that with James Mason and Sue Lyon; Konchalovskys Runaway Train went beyond the script with Jon Voight and Eric Roberts playing convicts. The directors of these films also knew how to use music to dramatize their films and reveal something about the characters in them. In spite of its own score a combination of Antonio Vivaldi, Carl Off and Bernard Hoffer, Circle of Two never succeeds in doing that.In conclusion, the idea of a forbidden love story between an elder painter and a teenage girl is a good one, but its execution in Circle of Two is terrible. In many ways, it is a shame that a controversial, Lolitatype story \u0096 which most film directors for understandable reasons would prefer to avoid \u0096 did not have receive more intelligent treatment; that a script which actors would have gladly rehearsed was not written; that actors, who were committed to their part or had the talent to make their characters real, could not be found; and that the director Jules Dassin who did so much better with films like Rififi and Topkapi did not have to will to put his foot down and say, Before we do any filming, we must rethink the love story and revamp the script. The only silver lining is that one day an intelligent film about an elder painter and a teenager girl falling in love may one day be made. If such a film ever appears, this it will be surely spark controversy, debate and questions for many years to come.","label":0},{"index":7601,"txt":"It is hard to describe this film and one wants to tried hard not to dismiss it too quickly because you have a feeling that this might just be the perfect film for some 12 years old girl...This film has a nice conceptthe modern version of Sleeping Beauty with a twist. It has some rather dreamy shots and some nice sketches of the young boy relationship with his single working mother and his schoolmate... a nice start you might say, but then it got a bit greedy, very greedy, it tries to be a science fiction, a drama, a thriller, a possible romantic love story, fairy tale, a comedy and everything under the sun. The result just left the audience feeling rather inadequate. For example, the scene when the girlplayed by Risa Goto finally woken by hisYuki Kohara kiss, instead of being romantic, it trys to be scary in order to make us laugh afterwards... it is a cheap trick, because it ruin all the anticipation and emotion which it was trying to build for the better half of the film.I have not read the original story the film is base on it is the wellknown work by the comicbook artist Osamu Tezuka is famous with his intriguing and intricate stories I wonder if all the problems exsist in the original story or did it occur in the adaption? It is rather illogical even for someone who is used to the fussy logic of those japanese comicbook. For instance, how did Yuki Koharas character manage to get to the hospital in an instantwhen its suppose to be a long busride awayto run away Risa Gotos character in front of the tv cameras right after he saw her live interview on the television?There are also some scenes that is directly copiedvery uncreative! from other films and they all seem rather pointlessly annoying ie. the famous the Lion mouth has caugh my hand scene from the Roman HolidayThe film tries to be everything but ends up being nothing... it fails to be a fairy tale and it did not have enough jokes to be a comedy... and strangely there are some scenes that even seem like an unintentional ghost movie.

This movie was nothing but an hour and a half of confusion with completely unlikable people not going to use the word actors and a script that you could tell did not exist.One of the things that made me laugh the most about this movie was how it said Victorian story written by which means that there was actually a script to that part of the story. The entire victorian section had no dialogue, and was just comprised of shots of a guy staring at a girl and vice versa. Making that part of the movie as scripted as a camera left on at a train station.OK, time for the story. It starts out with a guy sitting in a chair never once getting out of it. Oh blocking, who needs you? These newspeople come to his house and practically beg him to tell this story about these dead girls. So he starts off the story in Victorian times. and heres how the scene goes Guy and girl are in a field. pretty music starts to play guy stares at girl girl stares at guy guy stares at girl cut back to movie. That is pretty much all that happens for about half the movie.The rest of the film is incredibly awkward dialogue about a bunch of models wanting to buy an apartment. So this real estate agent shows them one and when i say the dialogue is awkward i mean, if it were a dancer it would trip during the MACARENA. None of the characters in this movie are likable. The models are incredibly irritating, the victorian people do not talk, and the guy telling the story has the personality of a sack of onions. So eventually all the girls get killed off. and by killed off, i mean drug offscreen. ooh. you showed ONE death? and by death i mean holding her face till they put the blood makeup on? awesome.HOW this guy even knows this story baffles me.

Unknown to the models and the agent, however, is that hells threshold is in the apartment and when crossed, the demon Dethman is summoned to kill all those in his path. The story is told by Sam Bishop, a journalist who was accused of the murders.Although I am a champion of low budget, microbudget, and independent films, I cannot praise this movie. The creators take pride in their 24hour shooting schedule and at least one actor boasts on the DVD of his acting prowess, but I cannot wrap my head around this. Why make a film in 24 hours if an extra one or two hours of editing would make all the difference? And why pride yourself on acting that is poor, nonsensical and results in the bad delivery of a handful of lines?Through much of the film, the models are being shown parts of an apartment by a real estate agent. The dialog is clearly adlibbed because no scriptwriter could come up with such empty diction. The agent, also, clearly knows nothing about housing... she focuses on aspects of a home that no one could care about, incorrectly explains the heat source did not she see the radiator? and says the vermin problem will be solved when they call the terminator. Please, write a script  some deviation is fine, but this was a mess.And why were the girls moving in models? Their careers had no point in the plot, and this seems like a forced situation. At one point, an actress breaks character and says something to the effect of dude, they are going to be upset which sounded more natural than any other line, though out of place because of the other bad dialog.The demon made no sense. I appreciated the attempt to explain how hells threshold jumps to random places on Earth including apartment fireplaces, but why not explain where the demon came from? His background involves a man whose love is killed by another man. How does this make you a demon? Also, why did we need all these Victorian flashbacks with no dialog and glances across a field? It was overdone.The dramatic pauses between lines was awful. The Sam Bishop character was by far the worst, with the interviewer not far behind. Does every question require a pause, a funny face and a response... followed by a pause, a funny face and a response? I was so frustrated. To me, the only point was to drag the time out... but I would rather have thirty minutes of good delivery than an hour of horrible delivery and then more time is wasted by rolling through the same credits twice.Who was the Sam Bishop character, anyway? Allegedly he saw all this and was accused of killing the girls, but yet at no point was he ever in the part of the tale with the girls. So how did he see them? And if he did not, how did he know Dethman killed them? And if he did not see Dethman, how does he know Dethman is the spirit of Apostoles? I was so lost... was there even an outline for a plot when this was written? The only part I found enjoyable in this movie was a scene with one of the models in the bathroom. Not that it was really important or anything, but it was the only break from boredom I was given. I wonder what director Felix Diaz was thinking. His music is very good see the DVD behind the scenes for his impromptu playing, but I wonder about his movie making skills. Although, by far the best part of the DVD was the trailer for his Superhero Excelsior the trailer alone was better than this entire waste of time.I am sorry I have to be so harsh. I would like to think that this movie was a test of what can be done in 24 hours or maybe just an experiment for fun and the idea was never to make a quality film.

It is then when we find out who did it and why.Also in the movie are Tom Smothers doing a terrible accent as a Canadian Mountie, and Paul Reubens doing his PeeWee Herman schtick. The plot overall is not very well developed, and quite lame, but some funny scenes do occur, namely the House of Bad Pies and the strip poker scene. The ending seems like it is thrown together, which is a shame.Overall, good for about ten or fifteen minutes total, the rest you can just fast forward through. Maybe catch it on TV, but it is not worth buying.","label":0},{"index":7616,"txt":"I was VERY disappointed with this film. I expected more of a Thelma and Louise femalebuddy crime movie. Instead, the women prison escapees in this flick, had no sense of loyalty to one another. They were an extremely vulgar pack of hyenas, who beat each other up, doublecrossed each other, and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the film.Instead of being shrewed thieves, who stuck together to plan their escape and find the hidden stash of money, the women escapees were too selfish and vicious, to trust each other for long. These women were not liberated in a positive sense. They just ended up being a bunch of loosecannons, incapable of respect for themselves, or each other. If you like 70s female crime caper films, skip this bomb, and see The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, which stars Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.","label":0},{"index":7617,"txt":"I believe Shakespeare explained what I just read beautifully. Me thinks he the lady doth protest too much. The whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself! He sites profane literature writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible a number of times however I can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible. Anyone can skew data  prove anything they like but it does not make it true. Customs change, word definitions change over time look at English  German where it is very obviously a common root nothing stays the same, it is always growing and changing. The bible has many different translations but the King James version is the one I have found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research. In the King James version you will notice there are certain words written in italics. These words have been added by the translators and can be dropped  the mean of the entire verse changes. Writings from around the time of Christ were written without spaces, without punctuation, without paragraphs  without numeric verses. These writings look like one long word  the translators added all of the above. For example how would you read this GODISNOWHERE do you read it as God is nowhere or do you read it as God is now here? Same string of letters two entirely different meanings. This is why many biblical researchers use a Lexicon to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original Arabic, Greek or Hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written. It is also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove God exists but you can not prove He does not exist!

But instead was given some of the least thought out arguments against the Christian faith imaginable. For instance, in an effort to prove that Christianity is inherently violent, the narrator constantly quotes the bible without giving context, and thus altering the meaning of the text. Jesus is quoted as commanding the execution of those who disobey him, when in fact, the quote is from a parable Jesus told, involving a king who is then quoted. Thus the narrator makes it appear as if Jesus says one thing when he is actually telling a story where one of his characters says it. This is dishonesty in a very obvious form. Is this really what Atheism has to offer the world? This film also attempts to use the success of the Passion of the Christ over Jesus Christ Superstar and The Last Temptation of the Christ as evidence that Christians are bloodthirsty. He makes no mention of the fact that the Passion was the most historically accurate Biblefilm to date. He makes no mention of the fact that it was actually the best liked by critics of the bunch. He then edits in a series of violent images from the Passion as if to hammer home his point. Ironically, he makes no mention of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre which came out a few months later and plays violence for entertainment, versus dramatic effect.One thing that really bothered me was his mockery of people who actually knew more about the subject matter than he did. All the Christians he interviewed were average schmoes in the parking lot of Billy Grahams New York Crusade. Atheists he interviewed for the film were notable authors and scholars. He asked the Christians how the Christian movement started, and of course, they said it started with the Holy Spirit coming to the disciples at Pentecost. Which is correct Acts 2. He then gives the commentary, is not it funny how so few Christians seem to know the origins of their own faith? and proceeds to explain that the apostle Paul started Christianity after being stopped on the road to Damascus. The poor chap seems convinced that Acts 9 happens before Acts 2. More deception? Or is this simply ignorance? He also throws around nonsense that Paul did not believe Jesus was a real person. Are you kidding me? 1 Corinthians 15 describes Jesus death and resurrection being witnessed by people whom Paul names in the passage for the Corinthians to question if they are in doubt!There are many many other examples of how full of crap this documentary is. But because I do not have time or patience to go into them all, I will skip straight to the end. It is obvious throughout the whole movie that the narrator has an emotional vendetta against his upbringing in the church. And the climax interview is HIS CHILDHOOD PRINCIPLE! In a lastditch attempt to disprove the Christian faith, the narrator tries to make a fool out of someone who gave him a detention as a child.

What matters for me is the idea of salvation, the idea of love as the only way to find peace in this world.What made me angry is when somebody takes a sentence, present it as a fact but without showing the context it was written. For example, they showed in this movie following sentence big Those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them  bring them here and kill them in front of me Jesus Lukas 1927 What they did not tell you is the context.

The production values were damn near non existent, the premise extremely shaky and whole thing seemed to be an exercise in Brian Flemmings insecurities.The production values were terrible and Brian Flemming is clearly an amateurish director at best. The narration sounded like he just narrated over the film all in one shot, and he did not practice at all. There were way to many umms and pauses when he should have been talking in the movie. animation was also pretty damn bad.The whole idea that Jesus is a mythical character is not taken seriously by historians and biblical scholars. As I stated before, I do not believe in God, and I do not think that whether or not Jesus was a real man says nothing about the existence of God. My personal view, Jesus probably was a real man but he lived in a time where there were many massiahs look up apollonius of tiana and that the stories of his life and preaching were blown out of proportion the farther you got from his death. According to the Wikipedia article on the historicity of Jesus and there is a good citation for this so it is garbage virtually all scholars in the fields of biblical studies and history agree that Jesus was a Jewish teacher from Galilee who was regarded as a healer, was baptized by John the Baptist, was accused of sedition against the Roman Empire, and on the orders of Roman Governor Pontius Pilate was sentenced to death by crucifixion.1 I was left wondering at the end of the documentary if this was more about the directors insecurities than anything else. I was left wondering if he was trying to convince himself more than anyone else. The most telling example of this is the final interview he was with the religious school principal. He is not even coy about it. The way he bombards the teacher is unfair and while I agree with the director partially, that teaching kids about hell fire is a bad thing, the way that Flemming confronted the principal was just awkward to watch. Flemming had a chance to perhaps get a good discussion going, if he was more tactile with his interview. Instead he comes off aggressive with is not it bad to teach kids this stuff. The guy cuts the interview short and I mean, what did he expect, the principal to say oh yes, I see it is, I have seen the light, this will now be a secular school? It seems that Flemming is getting revenge for what he feels was a wrong done to him in childhood. This is not about the documentary, this is about Flemmings insecurities, and has nothing to do with the supposed topic of the documentary. Flemming shows what he is really doing here, and that is the real downfall of this socalled documentary.","label":0},{"index":7621,"txt":"It is not like I have overwhelmingly fond memories of Verhoevens original pantsdown shocker  it always struck me as a glossy, wellmade airportnovelofamovie. Thrilling, sexy trash, but trash nonetheless. It was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist. After a decade of antisex AIDSinduced hysteria, a film about a wildlysexual hotbod who thrillkills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff. Basic Instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy, so the fact that it is desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sortof be overlooked. All it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable. That it resoundingly fails on so many levels, and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved, is really quite extraordinary to watch. Let us state the obvious for starters  Sharon Stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet Catherine Trammell. What was so photogenic thru Verhoevens lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gunforhire Michael CatonJones, who is flat, drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot.

His doughfaced mammas boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering, orangeskin machismo of Michael Douglas.

Poorlylit, fleetinglyglimpsed, as utterly mainstream as an episode of Desperate Housewives  the European sensibilities that Verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed. Do not watch this film for carnal thrills  there are none and what there is is tragic. The film is, as a whole, convoluted to the point of utter confusion, boring and laughable. The last 40 minutes in particular, where you come to the realisation that the film is, in fact, not going to go anywhere of interest at all, are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure. As a failed sequel, Basic Instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as Exorcist 2 The Heretic, Beyond The Poseidon Adventure and XXX2.

Flemming, in his 62minute documentary, asserts that Jesus was not a historical figure but a legend based solely on Pagan traditions. Using interviews with authors, philosophers, and historians to debunk the longheld Christian belief that Jesus, the son of God, lived among men, was crucified, and was resurrected, Flemming compares the Christ story with those of cult figures Isis and Osiris in Egypt, Dionysus and Adonis in Greek mythology, and Roman mystery cults such as Mithraism and finds many surprising similarities.In addition to his evidence about Pagan cults, he also states that the earliest sources for the Christ story, the four gospels, were written forty or fifty years after the date given for Jesus crucifixion and that the letters of St. Paul show little evidence of Jesus being a flesh and blood figure. Flemming, unfortunately however, is not out to conduct a solid investigation of the truth about Jesus life but to use the subject only as a point of departure for a full throttle attack on Christianity and all religion. Most of the interviews are with those philosophically aligned with the director including avowed atheists such as Biologist Richard Dawkins and author Sam Price. The only Christians interviewed are those on the fringe such as Scott Butcher, the creator of the website Rapture Letters.com, and Ronald Sipus, principal of the fundamentalist Village Christian School, which Flemming attended as a boy.Like Michael Moores interview of Charlton Heston in Bowling for Columbine, his interview with Sipus is so contentious that Sipus walks out in the middle. In a sarcastic tone, Flemming tells us how wrong Christianity was wrong about the sun revolving around the earth, then points to atrocities committed in the name of Christianity such as those by cult leader Charles Manson who killed 11 people and Dena Schlosser, who cut her babys arm off for God. He also lifts a statement from a book by LaHaye and Jenkins that says that Christians look forward to the day when all nonChristians are thrown into a lake of fire, howling and screeching. To further turn us against Christianity, Flemming shows us extended clips from Mel Gibsons The Passion of the Christ, detailing in minute detail each scene of violence and torture. What could have been a serious discussion on a very interesting subject eventually becomes a childish rant and a polemic against all religion. In the process of condemning those who used Christianity to commit unspeakable acts, he ignores such people as socialist Muriel Lester, a famous Christian pacifist, Rigoberta Mench\u00fa Tum, a Mayan Indian of Guatemala who helped found the Revolutionary Christians and received the Nobel peace prize in recognition of her work for social justice, and Mother Teresa, whose work was about respect for each individuals worth and dignity.His most telling argument is his comparison of Christian doctrine with the Pagan cults and he makes some good points, yet Flemming does not tell us that while some aspects of these cults may resemble Christian doctrines, there are no texts or source materials for these cults before 300AD, long after the New Testament. Also it is important to note one major difference. The immediate goal of the initiates was a mystical experience that led them to feel they had achieved union with their god. This is anathema to Christianity which believes that a Church hierarchy including priests and bishops all the way up to the Pope are required to interpret Gods will to mankind.Although I am not a Christian and have some doubts about whether or not Jesus Christ was in fact a historical figure, the truth is that, in the long scheme of things, it may not matter. What matters is that a message was introduced to mankind and spread around the world that contributed to mankinds spiritual evolution. Regardless of the distortions and crimes later committed in its name and there were many, Christianity as conceived was a doctrine of compassion and love, and a moral and ethical code that furthered respect for our fellow man.While I applaud the fact that the film was made and that a taboo topic was discussed, what is sorely needed is not another divisive attempt to use religion as a field of combat but to see it as a common thread that can bring the worlds people together. While there is room for debate and discussion on religious subjects, in the words of Annie Besant, spiritual truths are best seen in the clear air of brotherhood and mutual respect. The God Who Was not There is recommended only for those whose idea of a good time is to trash the religion of others.","label":0},{"index":7627,"txt":"I watched DVD 1 only. The program proper may have 10 minutes of good information; otherwise it is snotty putdowns of religious people. It is as if director Brian Flemming only recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm, and feels with these tools he can easily bludgeon his opposition.Also, Flemming wanders extensively into his own personal issues, and they take over the movie. It never gets back on topic.Religious people are prone to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are obviously rooted in abusive upbringings. Arguments from such victimized people seem irrational, and therefore unconvincing.Antireligious people will want more data. We do not need to be told that religious people are nutty, any more than American Jews need to be told how annoying Christmas music gets by midDecember.In the best scene, the Superintendent of Flemings childhood Christian school rather insightfully confronts the director on his motivations. That seems like the most honest part of the movie, and it was too short.If Fleming were a bit more selfaware, he might have a good story in him about his own past  current relationship to Christianity, and the abusive institutions that indoctrinated him in his youth.And perhaps he could lend his Christ never walked the earth material to a more serious documentarian. I am not studying the writings of SaulPaul to find out how airtight this all is, but a quick browse of Wikipedia suggests most of these arguments are discredited.The bonus interviews are pretty good, tho they do not bolster Flemings thesis much.

These creeds suggest that most of the central claims about Jesus were already formulated into statements of faith possibly within a few years of Christs death and resurrection. The testimonies of the early Christians cannot just be tossed out as mere fantasy. There were indeed many people claiming to be the Messiah during that period, but only ONE of them has remained Jesus. Why? Because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed Christ was the messiah, and go on to die for those beliefs, if they knew that he had not been resurrected. Even if the Gospels are dated more liberally, we are still talking about accounts of Jesus written within the lifetimes of other eyewitnesses that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these Gospels.

In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not. And this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to Christian teachings. Rather than an inquiring approach on the subject, it looks like a personal vendetta on the Christian school that affected his childhood. It also misrepresents the Christians most of the times as either incredibly naive or fundamentalists, no moderation in between.The director uses movie scenes from Passion of Christ without permission, sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents almost solely antiChristian historians and writers. I actually found the headmaster to be the most downtoearth person and think that his attitude was fully justified. I also strongly doubt that any of the Christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords or even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry.With this being said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity.

Yknow, maybe that movie could have been interesting, but it is misplaced in a documentary about the historicity of Jesus, and it is so selfcongratulatory as to deflate any sympathy.

Jack London 112443 Alfred Santell  Michael OShea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo","label":0},{"index":7637,"txt":"In his brief 40 years on Earth, author Jack London managed to cram as much adventure and incident as would seem possible. This 90minute film, purportedly a biography of the mans life but patently fictionalized, does not even scratch the surface, and remains a story very ripe for a modernday retelling. Here, Michael OShea, in one of his first roles, portrays London, and his performance is both rugged and sympathetic. He is not the problem here. Nor is a young and very beautiful Susan Hayward, playing his future wife, Charmian, whose biography on London is the basis for this film. Londons life has here been broken down into a series of episodes, which the film skips lightly through. So we have brief incidents with London as an oyster pirate, a sealer in the Bering Sea, a gold prospector in the Yukon and a correspondent during the RussoJapanese War...colorful events, for sure, but hardly given anything like indepth treatment. And Alfred Santells direction he also directed one of Susans first films, Our Leading Citizen, in 1939 is lackadaisical at best. Making things rougher here is a very poorquality DVD, with a crummylooking print source and hissy sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie rental, for me, was one of the DVDs extras a catalog of all the Alpha Video films, featuring hundreds and hundreds of fullcolor movie posters. Let us just hope that these films are in better shape than Jack London!","label":0},{"index":7638,"txt":"Jack Londons life was certainly colorful enough for a dozen films about different aspects of him. Sad to say though that what his life was used for in film was some wartime propaganda that put the best face on some of the least attractive parts of his character.Jack London who barely saw the age of 40 when he died wrote some of the best stories around. He wrote on what he knew, but he also wrote as does everyone else bringing the baggage of his own life experience with him. Some of that experience in another day and time would have been condemned as racism. But this was World War II and London was a big believer in the yellow peril as it was called back in the day.Two thirds of the film covers his life as author, we see his years as a seaman from where he got the inspiration for The Sea Wolf. We see him up in the Yukon in a miners cabin with a dog that was no doubt his inspiration for The Call of the Wild. London was able to capture the spirit of adventure that his own life was all about right on paper for the world to enjoy ever since.The final third dealt with his time as a war correspondent covering the RussoJapanese War. London was a socialist, but his socialism did not encompass folks who were Oriental. Like a few million others he saw the rising immigration of the Chinese and Japanese to our Pacific coast as a threat to jobs for the white people. He advocated strict immigration policies for Orientals.The film puts the cart before the horse. London is presented as a man who saw because he was on hand at the RussoJapanese War what Japans ambitions were and for that reason was as xenophobic as he was. Actually the kind of atrocities present in World War II were not existent during the RussoJapanese conflict. Japan had her imperial ambitions, but so did everyone else including the USA at that time. But our immigration policies caused by pressure from our West Coast politicians was a big contributing factor to the deterioration of relations with Japan over a couple of generations. London was part of the cause not a prophet crying in the wilderness.This film was the first independent production of Samuel Bronston who later did some films with a bit more budget than Jack London. Had he a bit more money Bronston might have gotten James Cagney or Spencer Tracy, both who would have been right for the role. Instead they got Michael OShea who was making his second film after Lady of Burlesque. OShea is fine in the part, but certainly was no box office.As London is covering the war, he meets up with a Captain Tanaka who is played by Leonard Strong, an actor who specialized in Orientals and played a ton of them in World War II. From the vantage point in 1905 Strong outlines in the best Fu Manchu tradition Japans imperial aims right up to taking on the USA eventually. Must have gone over great with the swing shift crowd. A lot of course is left out of Londons life including a first wife. Playing the second and only wife in this film is Susan Hayward who only comes into the movie when it is half over. I wish we would have seen more of her. Charmian Kittredge London survived her husband by almost 40 years dying in 1955.OShea in fact met and married the leading lady of his life in Jack London. Virginia Mayo has a small role in Jack London and they married for 30 years until OShea died in 1973.Maybe one day we will get a view of Jack London that will be a lot better than this one.","label":0},{"index":7639,"txt":"Caught this movie on the tube on a Sunday.

I was shocked at this; I always look at the hated it is as their are always those who hate a movie no matter how good it is.

For much of the film, the other Black men and darkskinned Black women in the film are way in the background, barely visible.Vanessa Williams character was strong and sympathetic. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. There are also some fairly visible and threedimensional support characters who are lightskinned, and some White characters of some warmth and dignity. But 99 of the Black males in this film are nothing but invisible men. Voiceless shadows in the background, of no consequence.

Not to be deterred I awoke the next morning and gave the movie another shot. I began again watching this movie in earnest. I just do not get it,I thought I would get it.I thought the funniest part was the flushing of the ashes and the urn finding a spot by the fireplace being used as a vase for what appeared to be dead flowers.

Not exactly faithful to the novel. As I recall, Dodger was publicly hanged and Fagin went crazy in prison. END OF SPOILERSOliver Reed is very weak as Sykes, doing little more than growling to indicate his evil. Worst however, is Mark Lester as Oliver, who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if he is really the main character. His portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl.

I do not believe Giada Colagrande has studied movie making long enough to develop a major motion picture. She is attractive and might develop into an actor but she took on too many tasks in this movie. Although they are married in real life, they lack chemistry on the screen.

I did not see anything like that, just a bad, boring film with unlikable characters and a trite, sophomoric plot. Giada Colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth up or Botoxed to the gills, and nary an expression touches her face. And her name makes me think of supersizing a beverage at Taco Bell I will have the Cola Grande!

A thriller indeed, but it was not quite so. That is just the advertising on the package for ya! I am quite perplex about everything. The title, the story and the motivation. So how to classify it? Well, this wooden character drama is more a enigmatically moody romance boundstory of alienation, possession and dependence twisted into a complicatedly passionate relationship of two masked individuals. Cowriter along with William Dafoe and director Giada Colagrandes arthouse film is just too clinical, distant and calculated with its mysteriously metaphoric story, which it leaves you questioning what does it all really mean\u0085 although when its sudden conclusion materialises, you will thinking why should I actually care. What we go through feels aimless with ponderous exposition of dead air that focuses of insignificant details and images. Sterile dialogues can contributed to many awkward developments, but more so make for an leaden experience, as it never delves deep enough. Like it believes it does. The sexually salty activities filtered in just never convince and are far from erotic. They are kind of a bump in the already sluggish flow. The base of the plot makes for something interesting and fresh, but it is never fulfilling and I thought therell be more to it then all of this dreary lingering. Colagrandes direction is professionally stylish and suitably gloomy to want she imagines, but everything feels like it is in slow motion and can get caught up admiring the same views. Most of the action stays at the one location\u0085 the house. Camerawork is potently taut, but the sullen musical score can get a bit ridiculous when it goes for some dramatically stabbing music cues that served little sense and purpose to the scenes. Giada Colagrande plays it sensually and William Dafoe sleep walks the part. He looks dog tired! While Seymour Cassel, pokes his head in now and then.Just where is it heading, is anyones guess. Well, that is if you can wait around for it. I think I will give it the benefit of the doubt, as it is definitely not what I was expecting from this Indie film.","label":0},{"index":7648,"txt":"The poster who called this Plotless and pointless literally took the words I would have used in my subject line. The only thing I would add is passionless. For a film made by a real life married couple and featuring lots of graphic sex scenes this movie manages to make what should be a sultry situation into one beyond ice cold. Dafoe and Colagrande look bored during the sex scenes, and the viewer might as well take a Valium and have done with it. Also, please, the women in the audience have seen WAY too many used tampons in their time, and any guy who is turned on by seeing Willem Dafoe pull a bloody tampon out of his wifes vagina really needs to get therapy.I think the key to the film if there is one is the restaurant scene where a waiter explains to the perpetually sleepyeyed Dafoe what a deconstructed jambalaya is. All the ingredients of the dish still separate rather than simmered together. This movie is a deconstructed thriller. All the elements are there spooky, isolated house, dead spouse,creepy violins on the score, weirdo caretaker who comes and goes as he pleases, auto accident deaths and near deaths, characters with a secret past. Basically every thriller clich\u00e9 you can think of, but NOTHING comes together. Everything just sits there and never meshes into a coherent plot or even an artsy mood piece.

Besides Defoe who was decent, the acting of the two and a half other people in the movie, Defoes wife Giada included, was ridiculously awful how they cast the part of the salesgirl at the bakery is beyond me.

If one watches it with discernment, one will see the entire litany of the radical right wing beliefs being promulgated by the Fox Faux News Network. To avoid giving away any spoilers I will refrain from pointing out all of the dozens of specific instances. A brief look at the plots found here on IMDb will disclose that everything from torture to gun control to the right of a network to provide Infomercials and call them news is justified with cute plot twists and impassioned speeches given by some of the best actors in the world. We watched many shows and finally gave up in disgust when they justified torture using Attorney General Gonzales as a shining example of why all kinds of torture should be used in the name of protecting all of us. The series also manages to demean male and female gays in subtle ways by using them as plot devices depicting evil people. All in all the complete litany of the radical religious right wing.No doubt the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as proof that America lost its way in the early part of the this century. As a student of history myself I would characterize this program as being in a league with the propaganda produced by Goebbels for Hitler and some of the propaganda produced by Hollywood for the American audience during WWII.So if you want to use this as a teaching tool to help your students understand how subtle propaganda can be then by all means do so.

Shani Wallis was far too old to play Nancy, who was only supposed to be 16. The current West End version is so much better than the movie in every way.

Their acting is so unreal that you even want to throw away the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think that these actors were not interested in the quality. Another awful thing is about these dialogs  they are so lame. You sometimes feel uncomfortable when you hear them. It seems that your 14 year old son could act better.

Alas, most of them were wasting their time. I looked in vain for any signature scenes given that it was Robert Wise on bullhorn. By this time he would made around a half dozen films and had still to find a style. The story is our old friend the range war and Mitchum must have thought it was barely a cut above the Hopalong Cassidy oaters on which he would cut his teeth. There are no new twists  if you do not count the unbelievable scene when Mitchum accuses Preston of sleeping with Thaxter to gain information about her fathers plans to move his cattle.

Let us hear Luigi and his blond girlfriends argument, please! The plot, which involves incestuous desires figuratively if not technically was disturbing to the point that it was hard to watch. To the writers credit, this issue was treated as a problem, and a MayDecember match is not portrayed as the rightandgood inevitability of some Mary Pickford films e.g., DaddyLongLegs. Chaney gives a good performance, as usual, but I think he has been betterdirected in the pasthe overdid it a few times here, IMHO.

Tito has raised a foundling a young and beautiful Loretta Young to adulthood and names her Simonetta. Tito has raised the girl in the circus life, and she has become an accomplished ballerina. While Chaney gives his usual great performance, I could not get past the fact that Tito, now well into middle age, has the hots for the young Simonetta. Although he is not her biological father, he has raised her like a daughter. That kind of ick factor permeates throughout the film. Tito competes for Simonettas affections with a young and handsome Count Luigi Nils Asther. Simonetta clearly falls for the young man, but feels guilt about abandoning Tito out of loyalty, not romantic love. The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and I find it amazing that no one in the film tells Tito what a stupid old fool he is being until he reveals it himself at the end. The film is noteworthy only because of Loretta Young, who would go on to have a great career.

It is a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste.The casting of the boy Oliver does not help matters tentative of timbre and vexingly precious, there is something less than solid here. Fagin performs his traditional routine adequately, though the tunes he is obliged to sing have little basis in period manner.As Long As He Needs Me is given a strident rendition, throaty and strained. The two big production numbers, Who Will Buy and Consider Yourself seem overproduced, with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in. It is one thing to go all out, yet another to cross over the line into excess. The gloom, despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography. While the novel is considered a classic, I must confess I have trouble with Mr. Dickens consciousness, in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration. This may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life, which was full of disappointment and regret. Not all the combined talent of this production, either on or behind camera, can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material.

Also, there seems to be many questionable legal aspects to what Tritter is actually doing. He alone cannot freeze accounts and have the authority to stop doctors from writing prescriptions for patients. A lot of the vindictiveness he is showing also is hurting the very sick patients at the hospital and the is not a good storyline to portray.

The idea of reviving the character in a bigger, slicker production must have sounded good, but there was no point in it, other than the hope of making money; it is just a show, which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the characters world and wholly fails to take the character anywhere he has not been already also, the actor was not at his best.

The raspy voiceovers seemed amateurish to me. I could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music. And what is with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff? It was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story. Cox added a lot of things, in fact, that he apparently thought would be really cool, but had nothing to do with the story. That is a big disappointment because one of the things that makes Borges stories so good is his minimalism  they are tightly bound, with no superfluous details. This movie is just the opposite.

Coxs apparent preference for single takes, jump cuts, and ambient sound recording all work against the films effectiveness. Worth a look but ultimately disappointing.","label":0},{"index":7683,"txt":"I respect Alex Cox the filmmaker, I really do. He is like the kid at school who you think at first is just trying a little too hard to be different, a literary punkrocker who has dipped more than his feet into spaghetti westerns and science fiction and fringeculture and come out into the world ready to take s on... but then you see what he can actually do, the talent and raw feverish artistry and moments of true absurd hilarity capable of him, and you are ready to see whatever he has to offer. But there is two sides to his proverbial coin he can either really hit it out of the park Repo Man, Sid  Nancy, Walker arguably or just try just a little too hard and pull way too many pretentious rabbits out of the hat Straight to Hell. Death and the Compass falls into the latter category, and while I respect its mostly original approach to tackling a detectivekiller story, it too falls on its face and its weirdness becomes oddly dull.It has a strange enough setup and already irreverent style to follow a detective, Erik Lonnrot, is after a killer with a hellfire voice, Red something, and it seems that the killer is leaving disturbing clues with his victims scrawled in blood on the walls are messages that, according to eyewitness Alonso Zunz Christopher Eccleston looking as if he just walked off Shallow Grave without changing his look has religious significance in the Kabbalah. We follow Lonnrot on his case, and his methods of going after the perp, which include following at first a triangular and then compassshaped pattern on the map this despite the protests of the flabbergasted Commissioner Treviranus Miguel Sandoval, who also looks back in flashforwards sitting at a desk and speaking to the audience in garbled but sad descriptions of his former employee and colleague after the fact of the case.Oh, Cox has his moments of creativity and interest, such as a shot where we see the entire scope of the harrowing depths of the police station where Ecclestons character is taken in by handcuffs For his own protection says Lonnrot in case of getting lost in the wrong room and we are followed in a long tracking shot maybe the best or just most curious where we are taken through very dark hallways with very little direction, lost in the maze of turns and oddities among the characters. And it is never something that is not fascinating to look at, with Miguel Garzons cinematography a morbid delight. But The plot goes through hoolahoops to keep things so offbeat it might as well be beatless alltogether. The performances, save for a confident Boyle and for Eccleston at the very end, are pretty bad, especially Sandoval who just seems to squirm in his seat reciting the goofy dialog given to him to speak at the audience.While the murder plot itself contains an intention for the audience that this is not something we have seen before, that it is in a society with a good many rioters and architecture suggesting Alphavilles next decrepit wave, it too fizzles out very quickly. What is the conflict here? I was never that much engaged with Boyles own personal mission to find this killer, and only mildly caught up in the few flashes of deranged scenes of the killer andor killers going after people like in the building early on Cox himself has an amusing cameo. And just when I started to think it was leading up to something spectacular, with Boyle and Eccleston in that big not as big as you think building in the South section of the city, it suddenly gives us a TWIST that we know in the back of our minds is coming but hope is not, and it deflates any of the humdrum mystery it is been leading up to. For all of Coxs uncanny touches as a filmmaker, for all of his opposition to spoonfeeding the audience with a conventional approach, which I do respect, Death and the Compass ultimately cuts one off at the brainstem; it is masturbatory.","label":0},{"index":7684,"txt":"Had I checked IMDb BEFORE renting this DVD from Netflix, I would have a couple of hours of my life back.

One day he mysteriously disappears after phoning his publisher and suggesting he has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger. The entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the Norliss tapes  a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural.In the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies  but not before purchasing an ancient Egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death. We soon discover the ring itself does not grant immortality. Instead, it only reanimates the sculptors corpse, allowing him to escape his crypt so he can run around town draining pretty girls of all their blood.Bluefaced, yelloweyed and growling out ARRRGHHHHHHs you have not heard since you last watched Scooby Doo cartoons, the sculptor attacks his wife Dickinson one dark night. She escapes and, via a mutual acquaintance, contacts Norliss to get his assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husbands uncanny reappearance on her estate.So is this guy a vampire? No. There is no vampire in this story despite what you may have read or heard. The sculptor does not drink his victims blood  he collects it. How? Do not know. We only see him attacking, never collecting. Why? To fulfill the second part of his bid for immortality. It turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if he builds a lifesize statue of a demon named Sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood. Once it is finished, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as his gateway into our world.THE FINAL ANALYSISThe Norliss Tapes was not picked up as a series for a very good reason... it was garbage. As you can see from my synopsis, the story is a paltry, illconceived mess. The acting and dialogue offer no better. This is not even a contender for a So Bad It is Good Award.

Wow!Nice to note that most of the positive reviews are coming from newbies to Bolls work. I myself, as I have stated in previous Uwe Boll reviews, only watch his films in the hope that one day he will actually make something good. I mean..IT MUST HAPPEN ONE DAY!Alas, Seed is not that day. I do not quite know where to start with the lame attempt at a horror film that Seed is. The thing to remember people is that all the sickos in the world are that way due to having watched various sick acts on video or the net.....or so Mr Boll believes. I still cannot for the life of me figure out why footage of real animal abuse and killings was needed in the first 10 minutes of this film. I understand the concept that Seed the killer is a sicko and enjoys watching such stuff.....but cannot understand why Mr Boll thought putting REAL footage in the film would work. Maybe to shock us? Hmmm.....well, I for one am not squeamish and can handle seeing anything on film. I Do not though, find the use of real animal cruelty footage entertaining in the slightest. If you were trying to shock me, it did not work. It just reminded me how messed up the world was because such things happen and also because Uwe Boll is allowed to continue making films. This sort of context may have worked for films in the 7080s Cannibal Holocaust but not todays market.With that out of the way, we can move on to the fact that Uwe has managed to give the film a very cheap feel all round like BloodRayne 2. You can just tell that there was not a huge amount of money floating around for production.As per usual, Mr Boll does not really care for making a decent story as we are treated to boring shots of police officers watching various videos of Seeds victims in the first 25 mins. Each of these videos ends in a speeded up decomp of the victim. It is all very boring and tedious. I will not comment on the toddler scene as it is laughable and just another cheap shock factor.If you manage to sit through the first 25 mins then you will be treated to the police officers walking through a very dark house in order to catch Seed. The lighting here is horrible and Uwe has the old I am not using a steady cam fiasco that he did with BloodRayne 2. Watch as the police officers die in ever stupidly increasing ways until such point as Seed is caught. This scene is soooo bloody stupid you have to see it to believe it. The cop actually tells Seed he could have shot him. For some unbeknown reason, the cop does not shoot him. Given that Seed is a sicko that kills kids as well as adults, you would have thought at this point in the script that sense would prevail.From here we are treated to a stupid execution scene, followed by the cops burying Seed alive and they know he is alive..why not shoot him in the head????, followed by Seed getting out of the ground and then killing some random woman with a hammer and then kidnapping the one of the cops family.What I am trying to get across to you all here is that it is just plain STUPID! It is not even Hollywood horror stupid....just plain dumb. Uwe Boll can not direct . Anyone with any ounce of taste would agree with that statement. Anyone who watches this film and found it entertaining in any way shape or form needs to take a serious look at themselves as a person.

Seed breaks out and goes after the people who put him in his living coffin.Filmed by the worst director in the world Uwe Boll, Seed is nothing more than a snuff film about trying to stretch the envelope of decent society and fails to deliver in any aspect of a storyline. And he said this is based on true events because if a person survives the electric chair after being shocked three times, they will be set free. This is an urban legend, and it would never happen.

But, strangely, Uwe Boll has written, produced, and directed a more polished film than any other he has made in recent memory.Every time I watch a Boll film, I feel that some pages of the script must have gone missing. There are simply huge gaps in the story and dialogue. Of course, nothing makes much sense, either. The films are somewhat surreal in this respect.SPOILERS Why do the six cops who go to arrest Seed split up and go their separate ways when they get to the darkened residence, unlike real cops who would enter and clear the house in pairs or by threes? Why do not the cops ever use their radios? How can the bodies decay so quickly, a process that would normally take many months? I KNOW it is timelapse photography...but Seed would never be able to stay on schedule killing people if he always waited around for the previous victim to decay to the point shown. How come Seed gets to wear biboveralls and a mask while he is waiting on death row instead of typical prison uniforms? How can Seed enter a maximum security prison, stroll around the cell block, and then walk out again without being stopped or even noticed? If nearly 80 people according to some newspaper articles shown in the movie have been murdered, why is there only one investigator working on the case? Why did the investigator suddenly decide that he should go look for Seed at Seeds house, where he was originally arrested and where he murdered his victims? Did not he think of doing this sooner? Why does the police detective go it solo, without backup and without even letting dispatch know what he was doing and where he was headed?This is particularly frustrating when Boll obviously goes far out of his way to make sure we understand why the electric chair fails to work properly. He spends several screen minutes in setting this up, when he could have spent them making other aspects of the film at least a bit more logical.END SPOILERS In short, the film just sort of serves as a framework for a few assorted scenes perhaps Boll would think of these as his visions of a brutal death by bludgeoning, gunshots to the head, execution by electrocution, and the skinning of live animals raised for their pelts. The opening scenes of animals being skinned were indeed unnecessary and disturbing, but I understand their purpose in the context of the film. The centerpiece is undoubtedly the bludgeoning death of a middleaged woman by Seed using a hatchet. It is obvious that much time was spent on this and it vaguely reminds me of the classic scene in Reservoir Dogs, though without the Steely Dan soundtrack.Is this a good movie? No. Is it worth seeing? Only if you are a dedicated fan of the torture porn genre or if you are absolutely determined to see a sample of torture porn. As I said at the start of this review, even though this movie is pretty disgusting and can be sickening at points, it is truly much more competent than most of Bolls movies. Perhaps he will continue to improve as a filmmaker. I can only hope that he progresses beyond torture porn and continues more in the vein of Postal.","label":0},{"index":7696,"txt":"This would have to be one of the worst, if not the worst, movie I have ever nearly seen.

It seems like Boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot but after a while just gave up on it. Maybe he should stick to comedy?! The few good things about this film is that he does manage to create an overall creepy atmosphere, that the special effects are better than I expected and the soundtrack does go well with the overall atmosphere, but the unbalanced pacing of this film combined with the utter generic nature thereof makes he last half hour quite tedious to watch, which ruined my experience altogether. There are a very fairly well done shocking scenes, but they seem to be there for the shock value alone.

You are actually almost tempted to think this is just a contemporary hype. You know, like it is popular to hate Uwe Boll whether you liked his movies or not. Let me just assure you that this is NOT the case. Uwe Boll is a terrible writerdirector and quite frankly a menace to the entire filmmaking industry. Seed is another most unfortunate of proof that. In here, Boll tries so desperately hard to come across as controversial and shocking that he overlooks numerous other elements that any movie essentially needs to exist, like a plot, a narrative structure, character development, tension building\u0085 Seed is a hideous movie, full of gratuitous filth and incompetent padding footage. I once read that Seed was Uwe Bolls interpretation of the nowadays popular horror trend of Torture Porn flicks, but that is not even close. The film inarguably does borrow some influences from Saw and Hostel, but basically it is just another umpteenth dull slasher with an indestructible killer and video game violence. The first 45 minutes of Seed are beyond boring and actually just confirm all the obvious things you already knew were going to happen. For you see, Boll was stupid enough to begin his film with a hyper fast scrolling text explaining there is a federal US law claiming that death row prisoners have to be set free if three attempts to electrocute them fail. So you know this will happen later on, but still the first three quarters are wasted on catching a serial killer and bringing him to the electric chair. Seed is a mute serial killer who supposedly slaughtered 666 victims exaggerate much? who wears a bag over his head. He watches reallife animal cruelty footage and thus WE watch reallife animal cruelty footage; thanks for that Mr. Boll and videotapes people as the slowly decompose in their cellar including a crying baby which is really sick and twisted. When he is finally captured, during the most amateurish and implausible police manhunt ever filmed, and put on death row, the film even becomes more retarded. After being buried alive because the electric chair could not fry him, Max Seed crawls back to the surface and goes on a brand new killing spree; this time mainly focusing on the people who arrested and executed him. The senseless plot twists and complete lack of story depth of this movie go way past being just bad; they are downright infuriating and insulting the intelligence level of the average horror movie fanatic. Multiple twists and sub plot in Seed are simply impossible to accept by the reasonable functioning human mind because they are just too dumb! Nobody believes that cops and prison staff members will just bury a mass murderer alive without shooting a few bullets through his head first. Nobody will accept that a fugitive convict cannot be found for another six months even though he went straight back to the exact same hideout place where they first caught him! Seed is full of retarded little things like these and the movie gets dumber with each minute that passes. Personally, I refuse to accept that the cast  crew members did not notice this as well. It really makes you think that Uwe Boll simply neglects all advice and criticism, and just stubbornly shoots his movies the way he wants to. I imagine his yelling stuff like shut up and do as you are told to his actors whenever they remark that the scene they are shooting does not make a lick of sense. Just for the fun of upsetting people, there is a gigantically overlong sequence where Max Seed smashes an elderly lady to death with a hammer whilst she is tied up to a chair in the middle of her own living room. Instead of shocking, as Boll intended it to be, this sequence masterfully epitomizes how pathetic and wannabe controversial the whole film in fact is. Seed is horrendous, it is disgusting, it is pitiable, it is \u0085 Boll.","label":0},{"index":7705,"txt":"Hello. this is my first review for any movie i have seen. i went through the trouble of doing this to tell everyone that this is quite literally, the most disgusting movie i have ever seen.

It is just derivative and inferior. And soulless.Long Version If you have never seen any of the films comprising the vaguelydefined psychological horror genre, this movie will probably melt your face off. Maybe not, but it will give you a good burn. The opening montage of real animal abuse will be sufficient to open your eyes to possibilities of brutalityonvideo, and the only memorable gore scene later in the film will perhaps be more than you can handle. The climax will play with your emotions in a way that perhaps no other film has.But that is if you do not have much experience with the genre. If you have seen the real thing...August Undergrounds Penance, for example, you will, as I did, find it terribly difficult to stay awake until the end of the film.Other reviewers have compared this to the video nasties of old. I understand this comparison. Like the video nasties, Seed is more violent than a mainstream horror film and less subtle. But the reason the video nasties are still known to us is not only for the above reasonsthose that are still popular had something special. Permit me to be ambiguous, I think you will understand those that have stuck around had soul.Take this quote from Gabriele Crisanti, director of Burial Ground, on an interview on the newish DVD ...we will never have more films like these, because today, technology has surpassed imagination. And technology is cold. So many things will disappear because small films like these will not be produced anymore. Today we have great, exceptional tricks that are very expensive, but they are cold. Today a horror, a terror film of this kind costs more than a million dollars. These films were not so expensive...they are real effects, made with our hands.Perhaps it is wrong to take the comparison to old school horror so seriously. But Crisanti has hit the nail on the head. Even at their most seemingly exploitational, the best of the video nasties were pursuing a primitive truth. And this is where Boll falls short. It is like he is seen the movies and not understood them. Everything on the checklist is there...BS about making a statement about humanity, an obscene torture scene, etc. But it is, as Crisanti puts it, cold. The gore is all CGI. The whole thing feels like scenes pieced together from other movies of various genres. And the pacing is sooooo slow. Man, so slow.Another interesting note the one gore scene really reminded me of a video game.Anyway, enough BS. Weak movie.","label":0},{"index":7708,"txt":"Over the past year, Uwe Boll has shown marginal improvement as a filmmaker, cranking out the competent In the Name of the King a Lord of the Rings clone and the proudly vulgar, post911 satire Postal. But then came Seed, and the counter was reset to Zero, keeping his bid for legitimacy and respect that much further out of reach. And I am a fan of the guy\u0096his films exhibit a uniquely screwball vision, and are never dull.Spawned from his frustration over the savage notices his early films received, Seed is a colossally misguided attempt at social commentary, and an even worse jab at creating an iconic slasher mythology Boll often seems to be taking a page from Rob Zombies successful reboot of Halloween. The antagonist is Maxwell Seed Will Sanderson, a mute, hulking brute who is slain 666 people and sits on death row, awaiting execution; after unsuccessfully frying the beast, he rises from the grave to seek revenge on those who put him there...and so begins a string of wholly gratuitous mayhem.Trying to create a newmillennium slasher in the vein of Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees, Max Seed is too nondescript and boring to leave an impression, ultimately resembling a washedup pro wrestler doing The Toolbox Murders on a succession of equally boring victims. Furthermore, Seeds character and Bolls message run contrary to one another the death penalty is wrong, sure, but are we really expected to sympathize with a soulless killer who is left a couple hundred corpses in his wake? I think not.Meanwhile, Michael Pare acts like a listless, longlost brother to James Remars character on Dexter a cop who sits at his desk a lot, thumbing through newspaper clippings, and watching pointless stopmotion scenes of decomposing animals and people trapped in Seeds lair. By the time he and a bunch of cardboard cops storm Seeds hideout, the sequence is so drawnout, illconceived the lighting is almost nonexistent, and unexciting despite a healthy dose of gore that it almost put me to sleep.The shoddy filmmaking is not limited to just that sequence Seed appears to have been shot by a drunken cinematographer, since the camera bobs and weaves endlessly, a technique that is more stomachturning than the gore itself; these protracted takes of very little happening only draw attention to the meandering, almost nonexistent narrative.

I never considered myself an Uwe Boll Hater since I think I never even saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named Seed which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about I am close to joining the hate club. This movie makes absolutely no sense at all... the plot is a joke and although Boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people 90 of this movie is just plain boredom. You can sum up this movie like this 1. Hooded killer watches clips of animals getting tortured on TV. This is real life footage from pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason of making a statement about humanity and giving a Peta address. Since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture pornexploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning onward.2. Death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets it.3. Cops watch videos of animals, babies and women starved to death and decomposing in Seeds basement, having stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey because Seed is such an evil bad mofo. Although the acting is OK the movie takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotions... 4. Cops bust Seed in his house, act stupid and get slashed in the dark. This sequence reminds me of a video game, you barely see anything except flashlights. Seed is a super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough to be killed... except for one who busts him.5. Seed gets the chair and we see his electrocution as lengthy as everything else in this movie... he will not die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must be set free if he survives 3 electric jolts. Guess what... they just bury him alive to solve the problem.6. Seed comes out of his grave, kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge on.7. A woman gets her head bashed in with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it. 8. Seed captures the cops family, lures him to his house, threatens to kill his wife and daughter. After killing his wife with a nail gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering thats whats Seed wants its hard to get into that guys head since he not just wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word ... the movie has barely any dialog anyway so do not mind.9. Boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where Seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence 3.This is it... no message, no plot, no reason, no face behind the mask, no background except a stupid story that Seed was burnt as a child.This movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value. I hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment. Its like watching August Underground ... thats fine with me, some people will enjoy this brainless snuff. But what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudomessage in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camerawork, effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid. So how does Boll get money to make such movies when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets?? Seed is not just the essence of ridiculous, its living proof that the free market is flawed ... lucky Uwe that the German taxpayer is paying for a lot of this waste to get deductments.","label":0},{"index":7711,"txt":"Consider for a moment what it must be like to be Uwe Boll. Somewhere, perhaps in those places that Jack Nicholson said you do not talk about at parties, Boll knows that David Lean had head lice as a child that had more talent for film making than him. Gore Whores, metalheads and the socially dysfunctional may bump into him on the circuit and tell him otherwise but general audiences find the Teutonic helmsmans output so bereft of originality, wit or imagination that he is become the internets bogeyman \u0096 an online discursive synonym for photochemical excrement. Boll does his best to ride over these naysayers, exploiting tax credits available in Germany and Canada to keep working and raising money from a network of dentists as Zero Mostel did with old ladies in The Producers. The difference being that Mostels character knew he was making bowel fill. Maybe Uwe knows it too.Such is the level of hostility toward each new Bollbuster that IMDb patrons sabotage their ratings by voting 1 before they have seen it. Bolls attempts at silencing his critics by challenging them to a boxing match and knocking them out just made them more determined. Indeed he is probably the only filmmaker that is boosted thesaurus sales as critics search for inventive ways of describing garbage.This onslaught has made Uwe a very thick skinned man, so much so that he must feel like he is wrapped in a carpet, but one who feels as if he is bullied by the entire world. Like most people in that situation he lashes out, determined to upset as many people as possible with the memory of a tearful evening holding Varietys review of House of the Dead, never too far from the surface. This I know you are but what am I strategy for reclaiming the initiative produced the blunt satire of Postal, which attempted to napalm the dissenters with jokes about 911, Christian fundamentalism, Jihad, Nazism and paedophilia. Such a litany of invective requires a satirist with the mind of Peter Cook and the visual imagination of Chris Morris but the closest Boll gets to either man is the o in their surname.In Seed, shot back to back with the aforementioned game adaptation, Boll is back with a story about a sadistic serial murderer is there any other kind? who gets the chair only for two attempts to fail in permanently curtailing all signs of life. Mindful of the fictional law that says anyone still alive after 3 attempts must go free, though if you would been fried with that much electricity why would you want to, they pronounce him legally dead and bury him, only for the disgruntled killer to resurface and begin a whirlwind tour of his gaolers.Boll begins his exploration of nihilistic rage with Seed watching footage of animals being tortured for experimental purposes. From there we are treated to the killers stock in trade \u0096 kidnapping dogs, babies and grown women and allowing them to starve to death on camera only to become maggot food. We are invited to reflect on what a depraved race of amoral meat sacks we all are \u0096 our inhumanity to each other and our fellow creatures acting as a lighting rod that acts as a catalyst for the most disgusting vestiges of the human condition. Yes, we are worthless, gormless sadists and worse than that, we will not give Uwe a good rating on the IMDb. In short, humanity is bunk.Of course you might think that Uwe relies on our worst excesses for his livelihood and with that in mind it is a bit of a bipolar piece, on one hand hating its audience and positively basting itself in the sour milk of human kindness \u0096 the milk that poor old Boll has had to drink for so long, while simultaneously whipping out its member and inviting those with a pornographic lust for on screen depravity to marvel at its sheer arse splitting girth.The result says nothing about society and its discontents, more the corrosive effect bad press is having on its director. Poor Uwe is obviously a very angry man \u0096 one scene in which a poor woman gets her brains hammered to a pulp while tied to a chair, no doubt a surrogate for his own fantasys about dispatching various web critics. That it is there but takes an avantgarde approach by failing to be attached to any kind of narrative thread, shows that Boll is a pornographer whose happy to engage with the blood lust of his audience and knows that plot is surplus to requirements. He is made a film which is competently shot but utterly desolate. I wanted to make a horror movie that was no fun Boll told the audience at the films world premiere and he has, on that flimsy manifesto, succeeded but if this was supposed to convince the directors detractors that he was a serious genre filmmaker, he will need something genuine to say as well as a better, more original way of saying it.","label":0},{"index":7712,"txt":"Dissapointing action movie with an interesting premise a young Mafia wouldtobe killer Chandler must demonstrate to his boss that he is a good man for the service so he goes to California to take some lessons with a very known professional killer Beluschi.

The lead female the Angel of the title is poorly acted and the actress is not helped by the script which requires some unbelievable, extremes of character to be portrayed.

How did Nic Cages character figure out that Charlotte was in fact a ship? How do they figure out all the clues and riddles in about a minute?

The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates how precious is that, I ask you?; a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of likeminded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a national treasure that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably unintentionally like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \u0096 attempting to create a Stanley Goodspeed regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a kings ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Could not Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Bens intentions are noble \u0096 if confusing. He is set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\u0085your guess is as good as mine.But there are a few problems with Bens crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes Sean Bean decides that he cannot wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives oh, yeah \u0096 brilliant idea!. Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase Diane Kruger. She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to actionromance form, Abbys resolve melts quicker than you can say, is that the Hope Diamond? The film moves into full XFileish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multilayering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, do not those guys ever get intelligence information that is correct? In the final analysis, National Treasure is not great film making, so much as it is a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL Betsy Ross blush.The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick.

In all honesty I really did expect something more from this film. Maybe something along the lines of Conspiracy Theory. Why? Maybe because of the casting. I mean, Nicolas Cage and Harvey Keitel, after all. Not to mention Jon Voight and Christopher Plummer. Now I am wondering, why did they bother? But instead of an absorbing action cum mystery drama I was caught up in a pastiche of breakneck silliness a l\u00e0 The Goonies, which to my great surprise appears to have garnered some actual critical praise. Perhaps it is because The Goonies was clearly targeted toward the preteen and teen audiences. Whereas National Treasure, judging from the previews, was seriously intended to appeal to an adult audience.Suspension of disbelief is one thing. It is how one can enjoy scifi and horror. But I found myself actually resisting the heaping tablespoons of paranoid and conspiracyladen tripe being shoved at the audience. Oh, the screenwriter threw around all the jargon intended to evoke a sense of serious engaged wonderment. Wow! The Masons. The Knights Templars. You know, this could really be true! I think the writer really lost me when Gates said the Founding Fathers hid the treasure to keep it out of the hands of the British! And just were did the Knights Templar come from? New Jersey? Oh, I forget. From France! Which goes a long way to explain how it ended up in Philadelphia during the Revolution. It was brought there by agents of Napoleon! Anyway, you see what I am getting at. The premise of the movie is interesting. And I really do think it could have succeeded as a serious mystery drama. But it just comes off as another kid flick in grownup clothing. In the end I think it asks the audience not simply to suspend belief but to render itself willfully ignorant to an insulting degree.I have just finished watching several items by Werner Herzog and Istvan Szabo.

One of his ancestors had been given a clue to the whereabouts of a huge treasure that our Founding Fathers, most if not all Freemasons, had decided to hide because they just did not want to finance their Independence all that badly.The first clue turns out to be in a longlost ship hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his crew, consisting of financier Ian Sean Bean, Movie Dork Riley Justin Bartha of the immortal Gigli and a couple of faceless lackeys, enter the cargo hold of the ship. They immediately spill out tons of gunpowder all over the floor, not that this is significant in any way. At last they find the clue a skeleton is hovering over it and it turns out to be a pipe with writing... on it. Sort of. Do not ask me to explain.It is a riddle, and despite the fact that his expedition is clearly miffed at not finding the actual treasure, Gates wanders around yammering to himself about the meaning of the riddle, in this frozen cargo hold, while the crew just stands around slackjawed. I mean, come on. Someone should have been a little vocal in their disappointment of coming all the way to the freaking Arctic and not finding anything interesting, but they just stand there as Gates enters his own world, solving the riddle.The next clue turns out to be on the Declaration of Independence. Ian decides to steal it. Gates is appalled. Various characters deliver gratingly obvious exposition get used to it. All this leads to Ians lackey pulling a gun on Gates, and the gunpowder going off in a big explosion. oh, that is why they spilled all the gunpowder! Huh!! Ian and his henchmen make their escape, and Gates and Movie Dork Riley walk nine miles in subzero temperatures to an Inuit village in order to stop them.To stop them, Gates concludes after trying the FBI and Super Archivist Abigail Chase Diane Kruger, Gates and Riley must steal it themselves. Riley then tells Gates in excruciating detail why they can not steal the Declaration, because it is so protected with metal and laser eyes and high tech security blah blah. Gates then tells Riley that there is an opportunity to steal it from the Preservation Room. Does Riley know what the Preservation Room is, Gates asks? A place where they make jams and jellies? I am not kidding; that is the actual line. Bartha does not deliver it like a joke, either. So Riley does all this research about the Library of Congress and the Archives and water and sewage, fercryinoutloud, but does not know what the Preservation Room is. This pretty much indicates what level this script is on.To make the rest of this short, Gates does in fact make off with the D of I, in a ridiculous breakin that could only happen in a movie. I also hate the way they depict computer monitor technology in movies  full of improbable and impractical graphics and fonts. Abigail Chase ends up tagging along for conveniences sake, and as an obvious love interest angle. At one point, the three of them, on the run from the law, discuss all their plans really loudly in a clothing store, surrounded by people.A series of clues and the kidnapping of Gates father, played by a dyspeptic Jon Voight, leads good guys and bad guys alike to a huge Indiana Jones funhouse located underneath New York City. Odd that the subway builders never found this thing. Gates and Gates Senior lead Ian off on a wild goose chase. Ian believes they are trapped in a culdesac and leaves them there. However, after they are gone, Riley asks how they are going to get out. Gates...... oh boy ...... presses a button and a door opens. No, I am serious. A button, like they might have on a vacuflush lavatory in an office building. Good thing he knew where that was. Anyway, after some more knobtwiddling, they find this immense treasure room remember, this is all underneath Manhattan! full of all sorts of historyish golden things. Riley gets to deliver a really stupid line. Again. And FBI officer Harvey Keitel forgives them, arrests Sean Bean, and allows the two chemistryless leads to get married.For any viewer, I think it would be hard to ignore all the exposition, the leaps of logic, and the stereotyped characters for very long.

In short, it was hard to tell which one was cuter in an anorexic rampmodel sort of way. Bon Jovi has the most charisma. At least he looks happy when he is smiling. The two Vampire Girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints. At one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss, but stop. Amazing how each Vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires. At one point, Arly Jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb Vampire Hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act. It would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof, and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched Arly Jover move her head to mimic something that was very obviously not happening. As far as gore is concerned, a few heads are ripped off, and the blood spurts profusely. These scenes have so little suspense or buildup that when they happen it is almost funny, and there is no horror payoff from the scene. All you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of Wow, that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the walls. I wonder who has to clean it up. Throughout the movie, these Vampire Hunters who are obviously trying to kill Arly Jover the top vampire in the world?? keep reaching out to her. At one point, Bon Jovi goes into the abandoned Church and after he just shot her with an arrow and has done so on other occasions, he says I am not trying to hurt you. I just want to talk to you. I want to get to know you. HUH?? Of course, the dumb vampire Arly jumps out to say hello and Bon Jovi sticks her again with another impaling device. Why Cannot We Be Friends the 1970s hit song by WAR should have been the theme song for this movie. Aside from all of the other silly moments, there is a transfusion sequence when Natasha Wagner has all her Vampire blood removed, and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion. I guess Blood Type is not important? Anyhow, all her Vampire blood is removed. Bon Jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him, he can beat Arly by becoming a vampire also. Of course, as the vampire blood is transfused into him, none of his healthy blood is removed. So apparently Bon Jovi is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body.

Let us count the ways they mishandle being terrorized by a stalker.1. After a hitchhiker threatens to kill you, be sure to tell him what hotel you are staying at when you drop him off.2. Beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses, thereby allowing him to press charges of assault.3. Do not bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume for no apparently good reason that the cops were bribed by him.4. While trying to escape, let your lady out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps her.5. After getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife, be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him oneonone. No point in being unfair, right? Now, I would never expect that any person would be immune to making a few mistakes under these stressful conditions, but the characters in Say Yes are so dense and make so many unbelievable mistakes that it is effectively impossible for the viewer to care about their safety, since they are victims of their own doing. This kills the enjoyability of the entire film. In case you were wondering, the scriptwriters did not stop with dimwitted characters. Since they themselves are surely dimwitted for writing this crapfest, they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the window.1. The stalker kills a cop inside a police station \u0096 while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet away.2. The stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in broad daylight and around tons of people, yet no one other than the married couple seems to notice his odd behavior.3.

The villain is punched, clubbed with a shovel and stuck through with a pitchfork, but never seems to be impeded by these, rather serious, injuries. And do not even get me started on that terrible twist ending. Sheesh.The only plus point in this film, for me, is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very pretty, but really no more than a mediocre actress.Overall, this film comes off like a poorly written, flaccidly acted and shockingly directed attempt to copy The Hitcher and Spoorloos, but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent in everyone involved.","label":0},{"index":7739,"txt":"This film is not deserved of the next few minutes I will spend criticizing it, but I know many people, like myself, rely on IMDb.com to assist in deciding on films.

Torture, dismemberment, murder, cannibalism... sure, it is all here along with a thirdgrade script, pathetic acting, and a perverted failure of an attempt at black comedy.The film takes place in China, yet everyone speaks English. There is an abundance of girls in the film who are horrified by the butchering of dogs in a marketplace, yet are sexually excited about entering a porno parlor. One gal who is disgusted by the filth in a restroom stall moments later is still there having at it with her friends boyfriend how he even got in there might be the only engaging thing about this whole film.

I have heard a ton of mixed reviews for this...but one of my go to hardcore horror reviewers really found it to be disappointing. Man was he right on the nose! This movie was acted by pure amateurs. They HAD to have done one take, maybe two on each scene, the movie seemed soooo rushed. The script was also poor....they had lines that tried to be unique but failed. Miserably. Get your meathooks off of me! Oh man, I hate it when movies try to do that. It happens all the time with comedies...but, with a horror movie and with below average actors....the results are incredibly pathetic. The lines and scenarios were all very predictable. But what made me feel so negative towards this movie was, again, the damn acting. It was awful. Besides by the little Asian guy who worked the booth. I thought he was great.The movie is about 5 stupid dumbsh!t tourist who are on a vacation in Asia. They end up at the wrong place and fall into the hands of a mafia run sexslaughterhouse. Sounds like a cool story. But watching someone with a bad case of diarrhea is probably more fun and intense to watch. The only reason this is considered horror is because of the killing. There was not a trace of suspense.I like many other horror fans were dying to get their bloody little mitts on this. But unfortunately with a HUGE capital U, the movie was incredibly disappointing. I did enjoy the ankle break and the blood effects. The flabby chicks were also so so.Everything about this movie screams amateur. This is Ryan Nicholsons first feature length, and for the most part he failed. There is no denying he has a sick sense of humor and taste for horror. I pray his next movie does not play out like another B horror flick...unless he tells us that is what it is gonna be. Even after this disappointment I am willing to give Ryan another shot. From what I have seen of him, he is a true, dedicated man to the genre.

As for torture, there really is not any except for the guy getting blowtorched in the beginning, which they do not show anyway. The main bad guy keeps saying make them die slowly, yet the butcher kills them all very fast. The deaths are all relatively quick. Yes, I did watch the unrated version.

There is no actual plot to describe. Five utterly brainless twentysomething friends take a trip to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but other than that I do not really know why they opted to travel there instead of to Cancun. They are clearly not interested in the continents culture and even cause a hectic scene when they witness a local butchering a cute puppy dog on the market. The quintet subsequently dives into the lurid night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan. A simply apology clearly does not suffice, as the gangster follow them into an adult theater and gradually subject all of them to vicious torture. One girl has her breast impaled and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake shoved down her throat; yikes. Live Feed is surprisingly boring despite of all the bloodshed and the amateurish production values are quite difficult to overlook, even if you are used to watching independent fanboy trash cinema like this. The fat bloke depicted on the cover, an oriental SM executioner, is admittedly quite cool and he is also the most talented of the whole bunch, because he at least keeps his mouth shut the entire time.

What put me out of the movie was the tough hero with the guns and a grudge saving the day... I would call this movie mediocre, at best, since a premise mainly involving obnoxious young people being slaughtered in a seedy porno theater, doubling as a hideout for the mafia, is appealing to me. If only the torture was prolonged enough to be thoroughly effective, then my rating would have differed greatly. Unfortunately, most of the gruesomeness is heaped together in one scene, leaving the rest of the movie to conclude as a revengetype scenario. So, basically, it IS just a lowbudget Hostel ripoff with the redeeming use of gratuitous sex, almost constant during the first half of the film...

I have seen some commented this as it must have been a school project or something. Okey, but not by students in media or acting school. This was NO class at all! And what about the story? A really sad ripoff on Hostel. And what about the gore? What about the psychopathic torture scenes that supposed to make your guts twist and leave you coldsweating? That was the most disappointing about the hole movie! Short, quick and NO edge. More like an execution rather than a torture. Okey, there where buckets of blood, but it did not even look real. The slaughtering and the violence reminded more of Braindead than Hostel or any of the Sawmovies. And Braindead was fun!

In the 80s video nasties, gore and horror movies were made with no budget but a great story and a load of new ideas and most importantly the heart and soul of the director who had something to say. Now they just seem to be pumped out in an attempt to trick people browsing in Blockbuster to rent a copy, until people stop doing this then I guess these films will keep appearing. This film is so low on ideas it is just amazing how it ever got made, the acting is also terrible, the location completely unconvincing and the soundtrack is so annoying it beggars belief. This waste of time has absolutely nothing going for it, unless you are on a quest to compile a list of the worst movies of all time.

A technical annoyance I had with the DVD is that if you shut off the Spanish subtitles, they return after a few scenes and then you have to go back to the main menu and turn them off again.

The plot focuses on these dumb kids, and one of them has annoyed one of the locals so they find themselves in trouble. The locals decide to lock them all in a theatre, and kill them. Despite the fact that I would heard some less than favourable things about this film before seeing it, I still hoped that it might be at least half decent because director Ryan Nicholson previously made the very decent 45 minute rape and revenge film Torched, but this film falls down simply because most of it is either ridiculous or boring. The film is obviously trying to hark back to the good old days of Grindhouse cinema which Hostel did, successfully, but it really does not come off.

After reading interviews with the director he says he respects constructive criticism and so i will try to avoid bashing the film just for the sake of it and offer my opinions as to why i found it to be so catastrophically terrible.1. The actors. I know the budget may not have allowed for great thespians but with Nicholson working in the industry for over ten years surely he knew some actors who were at least average.2. The incredibly lame make up and special effects. Once again budget obviously interfered with what was originally intended but after working in make up for so many years there is really no excuse.3. The obvious similarities to Hostel. Whilst not being exactly a rip off it sure does try to cash in on the former films success. Only problem is Roth knew where he was going and exactly how to get there...4. The music. Not at all creepy or haunting not even sickening just plain annoying.5. The script in general. All dialogue was forced and terrible! Also the sub plots about the theatre and the guy who comes in to save them were weak as and almost like an afterthought.6. The editing. WTF. How jarring, and not in a good way. nuf said.Seriously I would like to hear the directors thoughts on my post he no doubt frequents his pages on IMDb. cause buddy... what were you thinking. Surely at some point during either the shooting or editing you realised what a turkey yolu had on your hands...

After a scuffle in a bar with a Japanese Triad boss Stephen Chang they decide to check out a porno theatre, as you would. Inside they are separated  quickly find out that the place belongs to the Triad boss who uses it to torture  kill people for reasons which are not made clear. Can local boy Miles Kevan Ohtsji save them?This Canadian production was cowritten, produced  directed by Ryan Nicholson who also gets a prosthetic effects designer credit as well, one has to say that Live Feed is another pretty poor low budget shot on a camcorder type horror film that seems to exist only to cash in on the notoriety  success of Hostel 2005  the mini craze for torture porn as it is become known. According the IMDbs Trivia section for Live Feed writer  director Nicholson wrote it after hearing about certain activities taking place in live sex theatres, for my money I reckon he wrote it after watching Hostel! The script is pretty poor, there is no basic reason given as to why this porno theatre has a big fat ugly freak dressed in bondage gear lurking around torturing  killing people, none. Was it for the Triads? Was it for his pleasure? Was it to make snuff films to sell? Some sort of explanation would have been nice. Also why did he turn on the Triad boss at the end? If your looking for a film with a coherent story then forget about Live Feed. It seemed to me to be some sort of uneasy misjudged mix of sex, SM, horror, torture, gore  action films which does not come off. I mean just setting a horror film in a porn theatre is not automatically going to make your film any good, there still needs to be a decent script  story, right? The characters were fairly poor clich\u00e9s  some of their actions  motivations were more than a little bit questionable. It moves along at a reasonable pace, it is fairly sleazy mixing gore, sex  nudity but it does look cheap which lessens the effect.Director Nicholson does not do anything special here, the editing is choppy  annoying, he seems to think lighting almost every scene with neon lights is a good idea  the film has a cheap look about it. Available in both R  Unrated versions I saw the shorter cut R version which really is not that gory but I am prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the Unrated version  say that it might be much, much gorier but I cannot say for sure. There is a fair amount of nudity too if that is your thing. I would not say there is much of an atmosphere or many scares here because there is not  are not respectively although it does have a sleazy tone in general which is something it has going for it I suppose.Technically Live Feed is not terribly impressive, the blood looks a little too watery for my liking  entire scenes bathed in annoying neon lights sometimes makes it hard to tell whats happening, it to often looks like it was shot on a handheld camcorder  the choppy editing at least on the R rated version is at times an annoying mess. Shot on location in an actual porn theatre somewhere in Vancouver in Canada. The acting is poor, sometimes I could not tell if the actresses in this were supposed to be crying or laughing...Live Feed is not a film I would recommend anyone to rush out  buy or rent, I did not think much of it with it is very weak predictable storyline lacking exposition  which goes nowhere, poor acting  less than impressive gore at least in the R rated cut anyway.

Second of all, what is it with old Englishlanguage movies that are supposed to take place in nonEnglishspeaking countries, and everybody has English accents? Another example is David Leans Dr. Zhivago. Are not there enough either Jewish actors or actors who can do a Israeli accent? The movie often is not true to the Scriptures, and so seems to doubt the legitimacy of Jesuss claim to be the Messiah. In the bible, when Jesus is baptized by John, a voice comes from heaven saying This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased Matthew 317, Mark 111, Luke 322. In the movie, John the Baptist says this! The screenwriter seems to be trying to portray the believers as crazy, as well. For example, in the bible, the angel Gabriel tells Mary she will become pregnant with the Son of God Luke 12638, but in the movie, we do not see or hear any angel  Mary appears to be talking to a moonbeam, and when Marys mother hears her talking to someone and peeks in on her, she does not hear or see anyone either. Also, in the movie, when Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees in the Temple in Jerusalem, he says, You shall not see me here again, not until you learn to cry, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, for I and my father are one and the same. The correct line Matthew 2339 and Luke 1335is You will not see me again until you say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Period. Jesus never claimed to be God. The movie cuts out a lot of important parts the Sermon on the Mount is very expurgated, but then spends a lot of time on stuff that is not even in the bible a whole scene with Mary Magdalene talking with a john. It seems like the screenwriter, instead of wanting to do a movie version of the Scriptures, wanted to make a movie about what he thinks might have really happened behind and between the scenes. The movie has one gem though  during the scene where Jesus tells the parable of the Prodigal Son, at Matthew the tax collectors house, I had tears streaming down my face. It is the best movie I have seen about Jesuss ministry but that is not saying much, because the others are just terrible.

If I did not know that the movie is called Darkness  The VAMPIRE Version and had I not seen some sequences where some individuals seem to be sucking blood, I would not have seen the connection with Vampires. I mean, FANGLESS???? Give me a break!!!Second bad point what is with the Metal? It appears that all young people, but mainly those socalled vampires, are into various kinds of Metal,judging mainly by their shirts!

Tshirts running around,pretending to be Vampires! Pathetic is the only only word that I could use here.Third weakness the actors. Wait a minute. WHAT actors?! You mean the directors wooden friends! Words would be a waste here.Yes, alright, the movie is very gory, but what difference does that make? It WOULD have been a strong point and something to enjoy if the briliant director had not chosen to create an ARTIFICIAL vampire topic in this movie. I wanted to see Vampires,but was treated to some stupid looking kids I would have loved to use my baseball bat on.

I have watched Redneck Zombies, House of the Psychotic Women, Slumber Party Massacre II and many others. I know my schlock. And I know this movie sucks.Three fourths of the film is comprised of scared individuals running from one side of the screen to the other. When they are not running, they are spouting nonsequitur lines, devoid of emotion or motivation. When the actors begin to be acceptable, the direction falls to pieces. There were so many jarring lowangle shots; I figured Leif Jonker had a 3 foot tall tripod. He used what I call the Leif Maneuver several millions times that is, zooming out from an object of interest like an amateur. Apparently the film crew could not get up early enough to film a sunrise, so they filmed a sunset... and played it in reverse. With direction this lazy, you are actually impressed with the final gory scene. The only thing you can figure is that the last five minutes was filmed before the first eightyfive minutes.If you want a good bad gory movie, rent RikiOh or the foundational Dead Alive.

Over the last few weeks, I have seen dozens of the nominees and recipients of this award from the last 30 years and I really think that this film might just be the worst of them allyet it was not just a nominee but it won!! I assume that 1989 must have just been a horrible year for the genre.The film shows a group of characters that look a bit like superskinny Uncle Festers. The appear to be simple articulated figures who are moved using stop motion animation. All are identicalwith the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs. They are all standing on a large platform that is suspended, as if by magic, in space. Each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform. The platform begins tilting slightly and in response the men move about in an effort to balance the platform. This goes on and on and on and on for the longest time. The only relief from this tedium is when one of them acts rather nasty towards the end, but it just is not enough to make this fun to watch in the least. Aside from passable stop motion animation, this short offers nothing of interest to me....NOTHING.By the way, the great short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why it was not among the nominees. It was a GREAT short and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the year before. Perhaps Pixars success in previous years resulted in a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it. Could Pixar have not entered it?

Where to start...The acting, on Jeremy Londons part was horrible! I did not think he could be so bad. The plot could have been good, had it been well directed, along with a good solid performance from the lead actor. Unfortunately, this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be entertaining, but get disappointed from the start. Well, at least I got good laughs. I would not waste my time if I were you.","label":0},{"index":7780,"txt":"...though for a film that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror, there was a distinct lack of blood.There was also a distinct lack of skilled directing, acting, editing, and scriptwriting.Jeremy London put in one of most appalling performances I have ever seen  his descent into the maelstr\u00f6m of madness is achingly selfaware and clumsy. Oh look at him twitch! Oh look at him drink strong spirits! Oh look at him raise his brow, and cock his head at a jaunty angle! Oh look at his unwashed, greasy dark hair! Oh listen to his affectedly husky voice! He must be a tortured artistwritergenius! Oh, yes, out comes the poetshirt  it is another boy who thinks he is Byron. Or Poe. Oh for the love of... did someone give this guy a manual on How To Act Good or did they just pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere, the defunct little plastic toyprize in a discontinued brand of bargainbin cereal. Okay, that was a stupid line  but that is only because Londons performance has melted my brain with its awfulness.Katherine Heigl is cute, and very briar rose, but has yet to grow into her acting shoes in this film  she delivered her lines like she was being held up, in fact, her whole performance was very wooden, her poses as stiff as her lines  who knows, perhaps she was just reacting to, and trying to neutralise, Jeremy Londons flailing excesses, but if that is the case, she takes it too far.Notable is Arie Verveen as Poe  while his characters role is confused, he delivers the best performance of the piece. He, quite simply, looks right, but it is more than that  he has some sort of depth, I believed that he had a life beyond the dismal twodimensional quality of the rest of the characters. Huh, maybe it is just because I like Poe, and could thus just let my mind wander and invent while he was on screen  whatever, he had an interest factor otherwise missing.The rest of the characters are a faceless blur  there are all the usual caricatures the perky blonde bestfriend who is a bit of a floozy; the smitten local cop who is a bit of a dork; the protective older man who perhaps has too much unfatherly interest in our heroine; the scheming old witch, etc., etc., yawn, yawn. As with the distinct lack of blood for a horror movie issue, none of the themes that they mention and that Londons character mentions  so scathingly  in his attack on Poes writing are followed through on. As another reviewer said  there was potential here murder, incest,  genuinely shocking stuff, but instead they skirt away from the issues, and cut away from the violence a raised candlestick swinging through the air  closing in on it is victim  thencut to black! This is fine in a Noirish traditional horror, indeed, it is expected, and is fondly received when it happens  it is a dear convention, especially when accompanied by fake lightning bolts and intense Siouxie eye makeup  but in Descendant it just comes across as clumsy, or as though the editor got queasy at the last minute and cut it out. This could have either been a very tense psychological thriller  the horror of palingenesisdelusionmadness  or a simple and fun slasher movie it tries to be both, or neither something new and exciting!, but either way it fails dismally. The only horror element of this entire movie is it is epic dullness.I think the editor if there was one at all must have been drunk when she chopped this thing up  there are awkwardly foreshortened scenes; scenes that appeared to be out of order but that could have just been the poor script. LIkewise the director  cinematographer  there were some very strange shots and framing that I think were meant to be tributes to Hitchcock or Browning, but just ended up looking silly again, fine in a noir, but this was trying to be something else.The whole thing perhaps may have been funny in that way that previous reviewers have mentioned  OMG how did this get made?!? if I had been in the mood for some trash bagging, unfortunately for me I had settled on the couch, with the lights down low, with the express intention of scaring myself silly  this is a very poor film, and I am afraid I cannot recommend it to people, not even for laughs.Please, please, do not waste your time or money on this  either borrow a real horrorthriller film, or find yourself a copy of Poes fantastical tales, either way, you will have a far more enjoyable and frightening night than you could ever hope to achieve with this rubbish.","label":0},{"index":7781,"txt":"I watched mask in the 80s and it is currently showing on Fox Kids in the UK very late at night.

The lame ones usually involve Anthony Anderson as he is very overrated. Why he keeps getting cast is unclear because he is not funny. Anna Faris gives a funny performance and she is also kind of underrated. Simon Rex shows some potential as he actually was not so bad. Regina Hall also returns as Brenda and she gives a pretty funny performance. The rest of the cast were pretty much a bunch of cameos. Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson probably had the funniest scene out of all the cameos.

The majority of family home movies come closer to earning that distinction than Revenge Quest. No, this is just a 10 car pileup caught on video.We will skip the plot in this review, because there are far too many holes to be covered at once. Let us just say that it stinks worse than the rest of this movie. To call the acting onedimensional would be giving them credit. What little there is, is atrocious to begin with, and made much worse by the terrible video and editing.The worst part of this atrocity, though, apart from the plot, would have to be the effects... or rather the disturbing lack thereof. There are no blanks in the guns, no flashpots, and what few sound effects existed were either stock gun sounds, or they were generated by mouth yeah, you read that right. The filmmaker actually had the audacity to record a shh sound for the elevator doors; I guess he felt it made them sound more futuristic. This is supposed to be set in the year 2031, after all. That does not explain the sounds he created by mouth for the fistfight scenes, however.If it was not bad enough that the sound quality is terrible he just used the microphone that was mounted on the video camera, and it shows, the use of stock gun sounds was almost worse than not using any sounds at all. The sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunken yak in a herd of sheep, and they are just as clumsy. Picture this The bad guy enters an office building searching for his prey. A lady starts to run in fear. He raises his gun an uzi, and shakes it. We hear a sound that is clearly not an uzi. The woman runs away from camera, and suddenly a single blood pack only 1 explodes on her back looked like she was hit by a paintball, and she falls flat on her face.Bear in mind that my description does far too much justice to the ineptitude of the actual sequence.In another sequence, one which almost but not quite makes the movie funny enough to watch, takes place in a stairwell. The bad guy chases the good guy and the lady he is protecting down the stairs, shaking his plastic uzi all the way. You may wish to duck; there are badly timed sound effects flying all over the place.I supposed Alan DeHerrera cannot be locked away for conceiving of this train wreck, but he did follow through all the way to editing and releasing it. If there is any justice, there is bound to be some karma out there with his name on it.Should you decide to watch this lump of industrial waste and I would strongly advise against it be sure to watch for the entire scenes lifted nearly verbatim from Bladerunner, and the AM radio that doubles as a walkietalkie.

It is not difficult to see why! Using its Gothic theme as the pretext for as much nudity, sex and bloodshed as the films short running time will allow, Larraz who wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym D. Daubeney uses these commercial elements as mere backdrop to a languid meditation on life, death and the impulses  sexual and otherwise  which affirm the human condition.Shot on location at a picturesque country house during the Autumn of 1973, Harry Waxmans haunting cinematography conjures an atmosphere of grim foreboding, in which the desolate countryside  bleak and beautiful in equal measure  seems to foreshadow a whirlwind of impending horror Larraz pulled a similar trick earlier the same year with SYMPTOMS, a lowkey thriller which erupts into a frenzy of violence during the final reel. However, despite its pretensions, VAMPYRES waferthin plot and roughhewn production values will divide audiences from the outset, and while the two female protagonists are as charismatic and appealing as could be wished, the male lead Brown, past his prime at the time of filming is woefully miscast in a role that should have gone to some beautiful twentysomething stud.

If you watch this film carefully, you will see that both begin in an exploration phase of their relationship, eager to jump into the unknown, but not quite certain the next step. As they continue to meet, exploring new avenues of pleasure, they continually jump between the aggressor and the aggressed. Jang initially explores the idea that J is the one that in control of the situation, then hauntingly, the reversal happens when J becomes obsessed with Y. It is a very small change, and due to the graphic content of this film, it can easily be missed, but it is there. It becomes apparently clear near the end when J cannot live with Y, as their meetings become less frequent, and J attempts to become a part of normal society. This was a huge and very exciting element to this film to see right before your eyes, but alas, it was the only element of this film worth viewing.I will ignore those that speak of this film as nothing more than pornographic, because there are human elements at the core of this film, as underdeveloped as they are, they are there. It is a film about a facet of our lives that is very rarely explored in cinema or talked about in the papers. What happens behind closed doors is never known \u0085 or so we should believe. While the act itself does becomes repetitive after a bit, director Jang tries to change it up a bit with some constantly changing scenery. Our characters are continually moving from hotel room to hotel room to best quench their thirst for each others flesh. This is fun at first, but again, Jangs repetitive streak seems to make it feel boring than exciting. This leads me to the biggest issue that I had with this film. Jang had a great story with Gojitmal, but where he failed outside of the obvious choice to focus directly on the pornographic side was that he took scenes, repeated them time and again, without changing in front of us to allow us to get to know the characters. Where was Jang going with this movie? Did he want the sex to tell the stories, or did he believe the characters would? He failed in this sense because by the end of the film we know so little about Y and J that we could care less how they resolve themselves. The ending seems almost random at best as Jang attempts to create a final resolution for our two, absolute unknowns, of this film. I have to give Jang some credit for trying, but not much. He attempted to create some substories that would create the personal element that we were lacking, but they just could not congeal well together. Ys brother and Js wife were those plot points, but again, due to him focusing so strongly on the sexual element, these stronger substories became unrememberable and downright dull. Maybe it was just how I viewed this film, but outside of the sexual scenes, nothing else worked together. We knew nothing about J and Y and that is why Gojitmal failed.Finally, I would like to say that this film could have benefited from having a strong score or a daftly remote music genre element to it to bring us, the viewers, closer to the emotions being felt by J and Y. From what I can remember, and I am trying to push this film far from my mind, I do not remember any musical undertones. Gojitmal may have been a stronger film if Jang either stylized it with music or done something to allude towards our characters beings. While I understand that he wanted the sex to speak for itself, there was just a technical element missing from this film that may have quenched a stronger desire for more. Technically, this was a poor film. Obviously an independent film in nature, it felt more like director Jang was trying to make symbolic references out of nothing instead of your typical independent of this nature. I did not see as much of a social message or human element like mentioned above, I just felt like he threw this film together over the course of two weeks and understood that the sex would sell it enough. This was no Larry Clark production; this was subpar and definitely needed some further technical clicks to develop it stronger than the final release! Overall, I think I could have liked this film and there were smaller elements that I did enjoy, but I felt this film was rushed, repetitive, and played too much towards the taboos instead of breaking them. The obvious pitfalls of this film can be seen by the last scene of this film when we are privy to how the title of this film was conceived. Our characters were uneventful, our story was underdeveloped, and we could have used something memorable to make what was happening between Y and J into something more symbolic than sex. To me, Jang was trying too much to capture art house meets pornographic \u0085 and it failed miserably. This was not a film worth the time and effort that it took to make.Grade  out of ","label":0},{"index":7829,"txt":"This movie is a rather odd mix of musical, romance, drama and crime with a sniff of filmnoir to it. It is basically one messy heap of different genres, of which none really works out like it was supposed to.This movie is an attempt by Mickey Rooney to be taken more serious as an actor. He is a former childstar who always used to star in in happy comical and musical productions at the start of his career. In this movie he picks a different approach although the musical aspects are still present in the movie. But his role is actually quite laughable within the movie. I mean Mickey Rooney as a tough player? He is an extremely small boyish looking man. He actually was in his 30s already at the time of this movie but he seriously looks more like a 16 year old. Hearing him say babe to women and hearing talking tough to gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than he is just does not look and feel right. He simply is not convincing in his role.Because the movie mixes so many different genres, the story also really feels as a messy one. Somewhere in it there is a crime plot and somewhere in it is a romantic plotline and one about living your dream but none of it works out really due to the messy approach and handling of it all. It just is not an interesting or compelling movie to watch. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kardos is also a director who has done only 10 movies in his lifetime, despite the fact that his career span from 1935 till 1957. He must have been a struggling director who had a hard time getting work into the industry and instead once in a while was given a lesser script to work with. His movies are all unknown ones and normally also not of too high quality.Let us also not forget that this is a 50s movie but yet it more feels like a 40s one or perhaps even as one from the 30s. This is of course mostly due to the fact that this movie got shot in black  white. Generally speaking black  white movies from the 50s often have a cheap looking feeling over it and this movie forms no exception.It is a rather strange sight seeing Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and his band as themselves performing together in a sequence. It was not the only movie Armstrong appeared in though and he would often pop up in these type of movies, often simply as himself. I guess jazz lovers can still somewhat enjoy watching this movie due to its music, since there is quite an amount of it present in this movie.

There is a germ of an interesting idea buried in there probably because its a sequel to someone elses movie, but it is totally buried under an underwritten, badly executed and laughably unthoughtout script.The lines are dire, and the performances are unengaging, though again, I am inclined to blame the director. He does not appear to have consulted the actors at all about what is required, rather plonked the script in their hands, pointed the camera at them and told them to get on with it. Who knows, with a little coaching, these actors could have acquitted themselves better say what you like about musicians in movies, Jon Bon Jovi was excellent in Row Your Boat and more than acceptable in The Leading Man.As it stands, the cast have no chemistry whatsoever. A beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism parallel is passed up when, in order to infect Bon Jovis character with vampire blood from his ailing cohunter, he is given a transfusion. She should have bitten him. Mind you, they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too. The only real moment of sexual tension, between the two female leads, is by the directors own admittance accidental. He had originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more pointless plot exposition  so, I suppose the finished product could have conceivably been worse. But not a lot.Frankly, as movies go, this is badly plotted, silly and forgettable. Even as trashy movies go it is not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining.

And I can say that that the Power of Fear or Vedma as the Russian title of it is one of the weakest film among them. Firstly, it cannot scary even a little kid, it paces so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror. Frankly speaking, it is bad in all points from the goofy plot I do not know why the Russian producersdirector decided to transform the classic story about Ukrainian witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous moderndayAmerica thriller. I absolutely agree with the previous reviewer \u0096 it does not thrill a bit and to the terrible and cheesy actors work. All actors including the leading Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova who are quite famous in Russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they did not even bother to play at all, only spoke their English lines without any expression. And at the end I do not really understand why they filmed this flick in English with Russian actors? I think it was their wrong turn. At least they could cast some American or English actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing. The same I can say about so called small American town backgrounds which were shot in Estonia and look like it. The only positive moment I found in the Power of Fear is the visual effects. They are not excellent but rather good for the Russian film. And the music is OK, at least it does not irritate me. That is why I give it two stars. Overall, if you want to see good horror film \u0096 do not waste your time and money on this boring flick.

Unfortunately, as far as I am concerned, The Witch its Russian title will take a place of dishonor in the gallery of horrible Russian movies. It is based on Nikolai Gogols story Viy which is a classic in Russia. Based is the key word here since no familiarity with the story is required. Instead, the less you know about Gogol, the better. It is a unique production because we are quite used to directors taking stories from other cultures and adapting them to their own culture. The spate of American remakes of foreign films is a prime example, but then again, Sturgess turned Kurosawas Seven Samurai into The Magnificent Seven with splendid results, and Kurosawa transferred Shakespeares Macbeth into Japan to make an incredibly powerful Throne in Blood, while King Lear became a riveting Ran. However, with The Witch, we have Russians transplanting a Russian classical tale onto the American soil. The movie was shot in Estonia in English with the aim of dubbing it into English using American actors and have reasonably synchronous lip movements. As a natural consequence, lost is the colorful Ukrainian background for the story, in comes a drab American small town seemingly lifted from some outdated horror book manual. Gone is the boozy seminarian Khoma Brutus, instead we have a boozy journalist who is about to win Pullitzer prize, and who at the same time writes about XFileslike events and frequents Miss Boobs contests. I never thought Pullitzer prize was given for that kind of writing, now I humbly stand corrected. In a strange nod to Russianness, the journalist is named Ivan Berkhoff. They should have named him John Smith because it is impossible to get more hackneyed, clich\u00e9d and generic than this movie. Berkhoff goes to a town named Castleville, gets stranded on a dirt road, staggers on until he finds a dilapidated house and is rather unwelcomed by an old crone. All that to the accompaniment of a radio announcement about the forces of evil being at their most powerful, and people better staying indoors and avoiding water. Need I mention that it is raining really hard? After a few supposedly frightening scenes which had me laughing, the story finds our journalist dressed as a priest, he is mistaken for a priest, and the local sheriff tells him his daughter who died after being brutally attacked wanted the new priest to pray for her for three nights. At this point, the action supposedly starts. Those who have time to kill are welcome to it. What is wrong with this film? Everything, starting with the dialog and down to the prop department. The dialog which I heard in Russian was clearly originally written in English, and it was compiled exclusively from clich\u00e9s and platitudes picked from American films. The actors just as clearly struggled with English because the timing of their speech was labored and unnatural, and the Russian dubbing followed suit. The acting is mostly atrocious, and not only because the actors find it often difficult to talk but because they do not have anything approaching a range of facial expressions. For the most part, they are just blank or you wish they were. The only exceptions being the sheriff played by Lembit Ulfsak, a fine Estonian actor, and Arnis Lizitis who plays a wheelchair bound resident of Castleville. Oh, and a rooster of course who is absolutely natural on camera! I know actors complain of being upstaged by dogs and cats but when Nikolaev is upstaged by a rooster it is a sad testimony to the general quality of acting in the film.There was not a single scary moment in the entire film, and there was not a single original moment in the film either. Mind you, this comments coming from somebody who is rather inexperienced with horror. The film is filled with standard moves used in horror movie since the genres inception. At a critical moment, the camera lingers lovingly on a kerosene lamp. The lamp promptly goes out. It must have seen a few horror movies, too. An example of supreme idiocy comes at another moment, a character jumps out of a bathtub and runs at the camera. He is wearing something the looks like loincloth! It does not get any more idiotic than this!Those in Russia who liked it claim it should have been advertised as a mystical thriller. I was not thrilled either. It was runofthemill from start to finish. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the entire population of the little town behaved as if they knew exactly they lived in a horror movie, except they were not quite sure whether it had zombies or not. Therefore, some of them acted zombielike just in case. The makers of the film say it is about finding faith. Such a fine collections of idiotic actions, stupidly contrived moments, and, yes, clich\u00e9s, does not deserve to be about finding faith.

McQueen and his then wife Allie McBride also split up soon after their version of the film was made and one can sort of picture the Baldwins at their marriage councilor arguing over who is stupid idea it was to make this movie.Let us just get it said and out of the way  Alec Baldwin never was and never will be anything close to the Cooler King, and one of the reasons why this remake annoyed me so much is the perceived arrogance on Baldwins part to presume to challenge our memory of Steve McQueen in the lead role. Like someone else points out, Peckinpahs 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece meant to sort of parody the actionadventure heist genre. By contrast Baldwin, Bassinger  company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone, with only Michael Madsens and James Woods slimy unprincipled villain characters coming off as real people.The movie is also decidedly mean spirited and unlikeable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words. One viewing was more than enough, not just because it did not have anything new to offer but because of how artlessly it was made. Peckinpahs movie was actually a stylish little entertainment that had an upbeat mood, where this version is a slog that takes too long to amount to little or nothing. There is no artistic urgency to it is existence and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the film difficult to enjoy.So I do not know, this was probably one of the films that helped to initiate the wave of pointless, artistically vapid big budget remakes propped up around a then name brand actoractress, which in itself is not a really good thing.

The static oneroom sets do not help either, and neither does director Feists obvious lack of feel for the material. Then add a final car chase missing both imagination and payoff, and the results are pretty flat. In fact the movie only picks up in the stationhouse scenes where hardbitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocentlooking gas station attendants. Too bad that Tieneys career never really gelled. I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy offscreen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another. His icecold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his toughguy best. Anyway this project might have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it is a disappointment.","label":0},{"index":7848,"txt":"The film did what it set out to do show how a young girl copes with poverty and grows into her maturity.

My main problem would be that it simply is not scary. Apart from Jons character Derek Bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you could not care less whether they die or not, especially the annoying vampire  drug addict woman. The female vampire simply is not scary or sexy. Rather she looks like an anorexic 14 year girl, no wonder she is so desperate for blood then. Another huge problem is that everything is just too bright. There is no atmosphere or sense of dread. I know the first Vampires being set in New Mexico was not exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be. This film has no tension like that.The story is basically the same as before. Vampire wants Berziers cross to be able to walk in daylight. However the story has less cool bits this time. There is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master  the original vampire, as in the first film. You really do not care who or what this one is. There is no army of masters.

This is an uncharacteristically weak performance from Dalton, although he quietly nails the climactic scene where Dr. Rock finally realizes what he is done.

But the stockpile of these bodies is a small one, and Rock needs more  and he prefers them fresher. Being a maverick within his circle, he begins to pay people to find bodies for him to study and test on. Desperate sleazebags Robert Fallon and Timothy Broom get wind of this job opportunity and begin to murder people and sell these bodies to Rock. Naturally, this kind of action has even worse consequences than practicing on the dead bodies of noncriminals, and leads to trouble for everyone. While the overall story sounds intriguing on paper, almost everything about The Doctor And The Devils is laughably bad.After the first fifteen minutes of the film you are already beginning to question your decision of sitting down to watch the film. The entire look of the film is just ugly. Seeing as how the film takes place in the slums of England during the 19th Century, the filmmakers were probably going for an ugly look, but they do not do it in an artful way. Everything from the sets to the cinematography just look cheap, feeble, and disgusting. Also, just about everything scene is filled with something that you simply cannot take seriously, and most of the time this has to do with someone both in the small and large roles doing something that looks or sounds completely ridiculous. Francis sure did not help out his actors much.Jonathan Pryce and Stephen Rea play the twisted buddies of the film, Fallon and Broom respectively, and are very bombastic but very bad. Their characters are by nature crazy, but Pryce and Rea overact the parts to death. They especially have trouble keeping the same accent from shot to shot  Pryce in particular goes from Cockney to Irish to Long John Silver to some kind of lagoon creature and so on and so forth.

Aesthetically, the movie could have been pleasing, especially its first half, until it is not clear that every action portrayed serves as an allegory of various aspects of whale hunting. Until then, it might be slightly amusing to look at daily chores of japan workers, but later it becomes obvious that anything that appears on the screen is a propaganda, and no single frame is an exception. I use the word propaganda because the movie uses basically the old morality play device, where good and bad are not deduced in the course of action but are set in stone. Probably it is just me, but I find such type of art shallow and preconceived, even when it is all about the noble no sarcasm here quest of protecting the environment.In my opinion it is a cardinal sin when a movie material is stretched out without any justification, for the sake of stretching only. In my opinion, Drawing Restraint 9 could have been easily fit into 75 minutes, but has a torturous length of 2 and 14 hours. Yes, there were interesting shots, but there were not enough of these to leave 15minute gaps of nothingness without notice. The movie has no standard scenario, and there is no evolution of characters, but neither it is a documentary, it is rather a kind of conceptual installation. That is an unusual form for a movie, but it still can be viewed as art even when the concept is as simple and naive as here.

While others might argue that it is an antiwhaling piece, one could equally argue that it somehow also justifies whaling.

Is it that there is only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of film? Is it when Bjork is wearing what looks like a giant furry pita on her head in a pseudoAsian ritual? Maybe when mammoth turds and spinal columns are used in a whale blubber experiment. Or, when you are about ready to kill the composer for making a minimal, and still annoying, version of a Philip Glass score? In any case, Drawing Restraint 9 is among the most pretentious of the modern art movies. At 135 minutes, it adds to its pretension by being boring to boot. I would call the use of color stunning, and the opening sequence interesting, but the rest of the movie looked like it was filmed for a Discovery Channel documentary. That is until it looks like they were trying to film their version of Pss Christ, but that will be coming up later.Actually, the documentaryesquire portions were the best parts of it. The surface plot is about a whaling ship, and then there is a ritual about making whale fat. Then, there are the guests in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney who are welcomed on the ship by being put through a ritual of humiliation which includes passedout head shaving think frat boy pranks, nicotine patches, and giant furry pita hats. Then there is mutual evisceration, cannibalism, and lets not forget the giant turd.Matthew Barney has written that this is about the relationship between selfimposed resistance and creativity. That is almost like saying, if you do not get it, then you are not creative in your interpretation, so sod off because I am an artist. Oh, wait, that is the POSTmodern interpretation of that sentence and what the movie would be about if it was POSTmodern. But, its supposed to be Modern art. Which is about the art itself.So, let us start this whole interpretation bit, shall we? The following lines are only 34 serious and should not be taken as any realistic attempt to interpret the movie.The first halfhour concerns pearl divers and the construction of a giant ramp. Obviously, the ramp is symbolic of the need for selfelevation to whatever standards you hold dear, and the pearl divers are looking for pearls of wisdom. Then, on a whaling ship, they build a crate that looks like it is in the crude shape of a whale. Obviously a crude element of foreshadowing.On the ship, they make whale fat inside the shape of the whale, and take out the fins portion. They replace this with a spinal column and later a giant turd. These are supposed to be the states of the movie itself. When its fat, its entertaining but bad for you. When it is the spinal column, its the important parts of the movie, or the backbone so to speak. Then, the giant turd is the bowels of the movie, or when the movie is crap.Bjork and Matthew Barney the arrive on separate ships, are put into strange humiliating outfits which Are not EVEN WELL MADE OR SYMMETRICAL, one suspects that they ran out of money and Barney was trying to quit smoking. SO, they put patches on his head. They go through a ritual and learn about the ship from a Japanese wise man, who tells them that the ship is scarred from when another ship hit it; a crash or intersection, if you will. This inspires Bjork and Barney, who are different on the outside, to start cutting each others legs off and eat them so they could turn into whales themselves and be the same person. They intersect. Oh, did I forget to mention that this has been done in a Robbie Williams video? Then, the pearl divers come back with their mouths full of pearls of knowledge which they let fall to make a stupid Venn Diagram. Barney made it through 8th grade geometry, obviously. Or, maybe at least some social studies.Oh, and did I forget Bjorks eargouging Iwanttokillher score? At times it is hypnotic, but at others you just want to assassinate her.Art film is one thing, but when you just throw up all sorts of symbolism in the hopes of getting a reaction out of people, it becomes a selfdestructive joke. When do you cross the line between becoming a joke in terms of art? Dali and Bunuel frequently made surreal pieces of nonsense but were more coherent andor entertaining than this piece of trash.

That said, experimental films such as this are better digested in small increments.

I managed to stay awake for the whole thing if that is a compliment but more often than not, I was waiting for some kind of meaning or narrative...big mistake. Among the collection of images are a very ornate giftwrapping ceremony, the creation of a disgusting dish of what appears to be petroleum jelly slabs formed with a cookie cutter and sprinkled with shrimp this is served to the crew of the ship which is shown throughout the film, a large blubber cheesecake with a large tentacle turd placed in the center of it, and the mutual evisceration of Bjork and director Matthew Barney which eventually culminates in some bizarre kind of communion, followed by their transformation into whalelike creatures. The soundtrack is at times beautiful and annoying...sometimes even maddening. At one time, there is a song being sung by Bjork to go along with the ephemeral rituals being played before us, and at other times there is just a constant droning of a highpitched instrument, which we see a mysterious woman playing at the beginning and end of the movie. If this sounds like it does not make sense, that is because is Does not! If this sounds like your cup of tea, then you will absolutely LOVE it! If this sounds like something that you probably will not like, then stay far away from it, because you will most likely walk out of the theater during the halfway mark like several people at the screening I attended. This is the very definition of an art film. You get from it what you take from it. But otherwise, there really is not much there, other than a few oddities and constant construction and deconstruction rituals. I am glad that there is a place for films such as this, but I cannot say I would want to sit through it again. However, I cannot say I would not want to see one of Barney Cremaster films from start to finish and compare it with this. I think, perhaps now that I know what to expect I might enjoy something like this more. To give you an idea of what kind of comprehension factor this film has, I probably would have liked it better if I had gotten stoned.

Nick is present when a dying man claims that he shot the President and gives detailed information about where he hid the gun. Nick follows the clues, but every step of the way the people helping him seem to die in mysterious circumstances. Also, his father Pa Kegan John Huston, a vulgar and disgustingly wealthy businessman, keeps interfering with Nicks investigation. The deeper he delves into the assassination, the more Nick realises that he is descending into a web of complex lies and red herrings, where nothing is as it seems and noone can be trusted.The film is an utter nightmare to follow, and in many ways is not worth trying to follow for the aforementioned reason that it deliberately tangles itself up. The cast is packed with extraordinary talent but most of them are wasted. Toshiro Mifune has one of the briefest and most pointless cameo roles in cinematic history; Elizabeth Taylor appears uncredited and has not a single line of dialogue; Richard Boone is given what seems to be an interesting role but his character goes nowhere. John Huston has the best role as the powerful patriarch and provides us with the films few enjoyable moments with his acerbic delivery. Anthony Perkins also gets a creepy role and handles it well, though his screen time is far too short to do complete justice to the character. Some nudity and sex scenes are tossed in for no real reason and, while they are quite graphic and might appeal to voyeurs, they really belong in another film. The films semicomic climax is farcical and disappointing, yet paradoxically memorable in its weird little way. There is obviously a cult audience out there somewhere for Winter Kills.... but I will not be counting myself among its number.","label":0},{"index":7876,"txt":"I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne Bront\u00ebs novel when I read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy BBC dramas. But I am very disappointed, I never thought it would be as bad as that the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had.First of all, the music and songs seems totally out of place in a period drama sounds as if it is been written for a contemporary horror filmand like another commentator, I was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors. I have seen some scenes filmed that way in North and South and it seemed all right there but in The Tenant, it is definitely overdone and simply annoying. Camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively.Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity. None of the characters were properly introduced at first. The little boy gave a very good performance, he is very cute and the best feature of the film.SPOILERS Tara Fitzgeralds characterisation of Helen Graham made her appear cold and harsh, letting no emotion pass through. She does not seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way. I just could not believe Markham could have fell for her and I am not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given. I could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband! Fancy being married to such a virago... Besides, he was the only main actor that sounded right to me. Toby Stephens I found just OK, Helen Grahams brother not very good. Maybe it is difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty. Besides, what is only hinted at and left to the readers imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the TV adaptation making some scenes both gross and comic, like when Huntingdons eye starts bleeding and others far too sexed up for a period drama!

Now, the rodents involved in the laboratory experiment upstairs are not the only rats in the facility that will become the altered species. Professor Schultz, a leading bioresearcher, has just determined that the addition of a new enzyme now enables his hunt and destroy formulation to regenerate for the length of time necessary to neutralize deadly cancer tumors. When three varying degrees of the new mixture are administered to three different rats and the rest poured down the faulty Waste Hazard sink, shocking sideeffects result in a night of terror.....right.....Seriously, this is probably the worst film I have seen this year. Everything about it screams Lowbudget!, from the horrendous acting to the special effects which are some of the worst I have ever seen. The characters are clich\u00e9d morons and act in stupid, predictable ways walking down dark hallways alone, looking for a cat, tripping and falling so the rats can catch up with them, boarding themselves up in a small room, etc. While some films are cheaply made, this film really takes the cake. Every possible corner is cut, everything from reusing earlier shots, filming the Lab hallways from different angles to make it look bigger That reminds mewhy were only TWO guys working in this freakin massive building?!?!?!?, to music and special effects that could be done on a childrens workshop PC.That brings me to the worst aspect of this steaming pile of dungthe special effects. Just horrendous. The computer generated rats look so fake and stand out in every scene so even the dumbest of film buffs could see they are computer generated. And that giant rat suitOH MY GOD!!!!!!!! seriously, are we supposed to believe that freaking beany baby is a monster?

Five of Walters friends, Alicia Leah Rown in a very fetching outfit including some cool boots that she gets to stomp on a rat with, Gary Richard Peterson, Burke Derek Hofman, Frank David Bradley  Chelsea Alexandra Townsend decide that he has been working too hard  needs to get out so they plan to pick him up  party the night away.

All six become potential rat food...Also known as Rodentz Altered Species was coedited  directed by Miles Feldman  has very little to recommend it. The script by producer Serge Rodnunsky is poor  coupled together with the general shoddiness of the production as a whole Altered Species really is lame. For a start the characters are dumb, annoying  clich\u00e9d. Then there is the unoriginal plot with the mad scientist, the monster he has created, the isolated location, the stranded human cast  the obligatory final showdown between hero  monster. It is all here somewhere. Altered Species moves along at a fair pace which is just about the best thing I can say about it  thankfully does not last that long. It is basically your average runofthemill killer mutant rat film  not a particularly good one at that either.Director Feldman films like a TV film  the whole thing is throughly bland  forgettable while some of the special effects  attack scenes leave a lot to be desired. For a start the CGI rats are awful, the attack sequences feature handheld jerky camera movement  really quick edits to try  hide the fact that all the rats are just passively sitting there. At various points in Altered Species the rat cages need to shake because of the rats movement but you can clearly see all the rats just sitting there as someone shakes the cages off screen. The giant rat monster at the end looks pretty poor as it is just a guy in a dodgy suit. There are no scares, no tension or atmosphere  since when did basements contain bright neon lighting? There are one or two nice bits of gore here, someone has a nice big messy hole where their face used to be, there is a severed arm  decapitation, lots of rat bites, someone having their eyeball yanked out  a dead mutilated cat.Technically Altered Species is sub standard throughout. It takes place within the confines of one building, has cheap looking CGI effects  low production values. The acting is not up to much but it is not too bad  a special mention to Leah Rowan as Alicia as she is a bit of a babe  makes Altered Species just that little bit nicer  easier to watch...Altered Species is not a particularly good film, in fact it is a pretty bad one but I suppose you could do worse. Not great but it might be worth a watch if your not too demanding  have nothing else to do.","label":0},{"index":7881,"txt":"This film is easily one of the worst ones I have ever seen.

Why we did not get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me. Often the big one is not shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money. I surmise, however, that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed up like a woodchuck with thirdworld dentistry.The most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene.

The plot of the movie is pretty simple, Nell plays a writer who has a bad case of writers block, and needs inspiration, so she goes to visit Mexico to absorb the atmosphere. There she meets the hero Bert Van Tuyle, a cowboy who chooses to drive a car rather than ride a horse. While Nell is visiting with her fathers partner at his mining camp, a gang of local bandits kidnap her and bring her to their camp deep in the wilderness. The hero needs to get to her quickly, so he decides to drive there in his car. This is where the film takes a weird twist. Bert proceeds to drive over every terrain imaginable, huge rocks, small streams, heavy brush, scraggly tree stumps, steep inclines, etc etc, for the greater part of the film we get to see this car struggling to crawl over obstacles. Now mind you, this is not a modernday ATV, it is a 1920 Maxwell automobile, so it looks very outofplace as an offroad vehicle. And it clearly has limitations for some of the terrain it encounters, we get to see it stuck more than once in this film. But the filmmakers made an effort to show it beating the odds and eventually passing all the obstacles. Once the hero gets to the hidden camp and rescues the girl, he jumps in the car with her and drives off with the bandits in hot pursuit on horseback, and at this point it became hysterically funny to me. Watching this car slowly rolling over huge rocks, getting stuck in gravel and mountain brush, going forward and back to get momentum enough to pass over fallen tree limbs, the bandits should have had ample time to catch up. But they never do, even though we are to believe this wilderness chase goes on throughout the night. And in a silly climax, the car climbs a mountainside, and helps Nell and the hero push a huge boulder down the side to crush the pursuing bandits.After seeing this film you would think the army should invest in 1920 Maxwell automobiles because they clearly have better offroad capabilities than Hummers and Bradley tanks combined.

And while I recognize that reality is stretched many times in films, without lessening a viewers enjoyment, what was with the Mexican bandits?

There is a brief premise, which sets up the hero coauthor and Shipmans boyfriend to have to save the girl played by Shipman, then it is nothing but an exciting, implausible chase from there. Of course, it plays out like an hourlong advertisement for a Maxwell Sedan, but the entire movie is congruously ridiculous. It does not seem that she learned much from the lastminute rescue films of D.W. Griffith or its parodies by Mack Sennett and other comedians, which she is imitating.One point of interest is that Shipman writes and directs herself into the film as the writer of the films story, which has as its protagonist a writer Shipman again, although she does not do much else clever or humorous with it, even though she attempts to. Again, others had pioneered the writers joke in the intertitles, like Anita Loos with Wild and Woolly or Frances Marion with A Girls Folly both 1917.

An entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as humor or even entertainment in Rabbit Test. So, as a small contribution to this future effort, I would like to suggest this word Hubiriffic adj. A combination of hubristic and terrific; used to describe overly ambitious debacles like the film Rabbit Test.Joan Rivers and Hollywood Squares producer Jay Redack have severely overreached their meager abilities to amuse in this 82minute festival of wretchedness. Trying to put together an Airplane! style comedy with a moldy collection of gags, Note to Joan German doctors have not been funny since Vaudeville disinterred from their graves in the Catskills  that is is bad enough. But compounding this cinematic crime is Rivers directorial style, which can best be described as ugly, and a cast of onceandfuture hasbeens so eager to please they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gags.Adrift in this Sargasso Sea of sap is a hapless Billy Crystal in his film debut role as the films hapless protagonist Lionel. Watching Crystal in this pic is much like watching a blind person take a stroll in a minefield; eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semipermanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his face.I can only speculate about the sort of audience who might actually like Rabbit Test.

Unless they love Billy Crytal,Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers that much! Paul Lynde was funnier on Bewitched or Hollywood Squares than here. Joan Rivers at this time in her career was getting laughs making cruel jokes about singer Karen Carpenters lack of weight! Harhar Joan! It also seems like every somewhat famous name from the era is in the cast. Most surprising is Doris Roberts later of Everybody Loves Raymond.Anyhow,a somewhat good idea for a storyline,a man getting pregnant instead of the woman goes to waste here. With help from a male friend Crystal gets set up with a hooker to finally lose his virginity but because she was on top instead of him,he gets pregnant! A commentary on women taking positions of power away from men.Crystals stomach grows,he goes through all the female emotions and related feelings. Unfortunately,he is now a socially misunderstood outcast! He is attacked by a mob who wants him rubbed out I guess.He is forced to go into seclusion to have his baby...in a barn.

She disfigured the heroine completely! That was really disgusting to watch her play! To my mind, that would be much better to give this role to a Russian actress, because that would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for a Russian person.

They behave like modern EU citizens dressed up for a oneday masquerade. It all looks cheap and never comes close to the standards of our Russian men and women of the early 19th century.A good piece of entertainment to scrutinize and make fun of. We had quite a few giggles in our office when remembering this modern product, which had been shown the previous evening on our TV.User Rating 8.010 29 votes  I guess, many young people have never watched our film Voyna i mir 1968 or have weird sense of TarantinoSpielberg quality. Remember the scene when our hussar is saving his friend, turns around, shoots, and the bridge goes boom? Looks like a CGI explosion.There is neither sense nor craft to make a better version of the novel, which was screened properly in our country once. But I would be happy to watch a Russian remake of Gone with the Wind. Hey, directors, wake up and get busy with that, instead of spoiling our classics.Now back to common sense. Jokes aside. What I mentioned above is nothing new, though deadly exaggerated.To make foreign actors trying to pass for Russians while participating in very serious epics and dramas is a rude mistake and the filmmakers are making this mistake again and again. Of course it results in numerous laughs  especially Clemence Poesy is uncomfortably ridiculous and her dancing and singing makes a Russian viewer think This sucks so much that it is funny!.In order to say something new, I would like to mention the pace of the movie. To my mind, this new version is very patchy. The narration and the scenes are not naturally flowing  they stagger and pop up like in a modern video. Again I have to remember our Voyna i mir, where the action is so natural and the narration is so easy that you simply sit back and enjoy going with the flow.I thought that maybe the Borodino battle would be great to somehow rehabilitate numerous drawbacks but it has turned out to be no match for the war scenes filmed in 1968.There should be something good in this movie after all. And there is. The actors seem to be trying hard to make it all work. They did not have a chance from the start but they still joined the losers team. Plus 1 point for that recklessness. It makes a Russian viewer uncomfortable  some scenes are ironically ridiculous though they are intended to be dramatically powerful and the actors are doing their best. It all evokes pity, and sometimes  fits of laughter.What I still like about this serial is the last part of it. It shows very vividly how everybody gets his or her salary and taxes. Besides, judging by the movie trailers I thought that the film would have an adult sex scene, which would definitely kill the whole project. But, fortunately, it does not have such rubbish. And that is a big plus.Voyna i Mir is no Harry Potter and nowadays even we, here in presentday Russia, do not have enough craft to film it properly. Do I have to say that the moral quality of our life has deteriorated immensely? Fortunately, a proper film was screened during our Soviet times. The American version of the 1950s was justified to some extent  ours did not even exist yet. There were extenuating circumstances then.4 out of 10 1 point is given from the start, 1 point goes for the recklessness, and 2 points for the last part of the serial.

We follow them for an interminable fortyodd minutes as they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. Although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive track and learn about babies natural diving reflexes, do we really learn anything more than most gradeschool graduates? Are we even remotely entertained by the transAtlantic Heather? Do we care? Avoid this film at all cost. If you do wish to see an IMAX feature, I suggest the beautifully photographed India Kingdom of the Tiger or the technically thrilling Space Station 3D.

However, this time around I found myself a little restless, somewhat bored. It is not a bad film, but it is at least halfanhour longer than it should be, with its absurd 110 minutes length. Compared to many other Japanese horror films, OMC lacks atmosphere and excitement. Plus, the ending is confusing it makes no sense at all.

The story goes like this a bunch of college kids get voice mails from their own phones that are foretelling their deaths. There is some s going on with ghosts, which if you have seen any Asian ghost movie, is not scary by now. This movie was quite upsetting because it is very clich\u00e9d. It is the same bullcrap, different movie.The acting was pretty good. Unfortunately the actors are put into a very Ringesquire situation, so it is nothing we have not seen in the past. The two lead acts did a solid job though.As far as gore, there is not much going on. We get a cool sequence that includes an arm twisting a head off I do not know how else to explain that, but it was cut away so you do not see anything except the final result. You see some blood at times, including decapitated arms and a zombie that looked really cool I might add, but this movie is not too bloody.The scares in the movie are few and spread out, and it is really not that scary. You will get some creepy images at times, but it is not enough for me to consider scary. It is nothing different from Ringu, JuOn, or Dark Water, and none of those scared me either. That is really the downfall of this and most Asian horror movies is that if it does not deliver the scares then it is just not that good.As far as directing, Takashi Miike still did a pretty good job. He seemed a little tamed in this movie compared to his past movies, but he still portrays a lot of his messed up style he is become famous for. A lot of images were a lot like Miike including a scene with a bunch of jars of dead fetuses, and the last 15  20 minutes seemed far more Miike then the rest of the movie. Still, the movie is flawed by its unoriginality.I would recommend this only to people who are huge on Asian horror movies even if you are, I can recommend much better or big Miike fans. Warning to those who want to get into Miike, this is NOT his best work.I am giving it a 4 because it is just mediocre. Perhaps if this was released 4 or 5 years ago it might be worth a higher rating.Also, I would like to b about Asian horror movies real quick. How come if it is an Asian horror movie it is automatically suppose to be good over here US? A LOT of these movies are the equivalent in Japan to what Scream, Urban Legends, and I Know What You Did Last Summer were over here in the 90s. If you have seen one you have seen them all. And a lot of these movies rely way too much on scares and imagery that if it does not deliver the scares they set out to do then they are just not that good, and nothing would change that. More Asian horror films need to be more like Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters, two movies that if they do not frighten or scare you, at least they have great stories, acting, direction, cinematography, and much more to back them up. Two movies that are not just great horror movies, but great movies in general.

I sat through this flick tonight. I figured, if it is half as good as Ringu, as I assumed from these comments it might be, than it will be worth my time.No such luck.I am all for finding the next great director or writer, but I do not think Miike is the one. I do not have an NYU Masters of Fine Arts, but I do know this much a horror movie has to have pacing. It also has to give the viewer more credulity than this movie does.This films pacing had me shaking my head. Some of the scenes near the end dragged so badly, I went to the fridge and lingered there while Kou Shibasaki stared at the camera for seemingly minutes on end, eyes wide and mouth agape. A famous director once made the claim, and I am paraphrasing, a movie could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it roll. Kou is not a good enough actress to make that work. She stares paralyzed at the undead girl for more scenes than I care to remember. And she is not the only one doing an impersonation of a deer in headlights; other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this nonperformance. The script gives them little room to do much else for far too much of the time.I like Asian cinema.

The plot is plain stupid, the directing is awful, acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of socalled Horror Soundtracks. There is not a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie, and some of the scenes are really hard to stand. especially the scene, where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby crieshorrible. I cannot understand why the movie was rated 16 in Germany, where normally the criteria are real tough e.g. killbill brutal but it made fun of itself and had great allusions to Asian cinema and besides a magnificent directing even a movie like state of grace is rated 18. No one can call this a Horror movie, because actually it was more about showing gore than about scaring the public Showing the Creeps face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision; for me excuse my expression it is just one insane director living out his disturbing fantasies. In some scenes you see violence, that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot nor does it explain anything. The plot has holes and flaws, the dialog is boring, honestly I cannot mention a single positive aspect of the movie except for the British and Scottish accent.If I had something to say, I would ban this movie from the theaters, I fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap.I am looking forward to getting feedbacks to my thread and I would be happy to discuss about one or the other topic.Livin the dream baby, livin the dream David Aames","label":0},{"index":7943,"txt":"When an attempt is made to assassinate the Emir of Ohtar, an Arab potentate visiting Washington, D.C., his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named Sunny Davis. Sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the Protocol Section of the United States Department of State. Unknown to her however, the State Department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agenda.A map we see shows Ohtar lying on the borders of Saudi Arabia and South Yemen, in an area of barren desert known as the Rub alKhali, or Empty Quarter. In real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero, and virtually zero strategic value, but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that Ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the Cold War and that the American government, who are keen to build a military base there, need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler. It transpires that the Emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the State Department; they can have their base provided that he can have Sunny as the latest addition to his harem. Sunnys new job is just a ruse to ensure that the Emir has further opportunities to meet her.A plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire, but in fact the films satirical content is rather toned down. Possibly in 1984 the American public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their countrys foreign policy; this was, after all, the year in which Ronald Reagan carried fortynine out of fifty states in the Presidential election and his hard line with the Soviet Union was clearly going down well with the voters. If the film had been made a couple of years later, in the wake of the IranContra affair, its tone might have been different.The film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for Goldie Hawn to show off her brand of cuteness and charm. Sunny is a typical Goldie character pretty, sweetnatured, naive and not too bright. There is, however, a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone, and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde. Actually, that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one. Goldie tries her best to save this one, but never succeeds. Part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed. On the one hand Sunny is a sweet, innocent country girl from Oregon. On the other hand she is a 35yearold woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume. The effect is rather like imagining Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm grown up and working as a Bunny Girl.The more important reason why Goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than hisher material, and Protocol is simply unfunny. Whatever humour exists is tired and strained, relying on offensive stereotypes about Arab men who, apparently, all lust after Western women, particularly if they are blonde and blueeyed. There was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mideighties, as this was the period which also saw the awful Ben Kingsley Nastassia Kinski film Harem, about a lascivious Middle Eastern ruler who kidnaps a young American woman, and the miniseries of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting. The filmmakers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy, because towards the end it turns into a sort of latterday Mr Smith Goes to Washington. Sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about Democracy and the Constitution and the Citizens Duty to Vote and We The People and how the Price of Liberty is Eternal Vigilance blah blah blah\u0085\u0085, but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedy.Goldie Hawn has made a number of good comedies, such as Cactus Flower, Overboard and Housesitter, but Protocol is not one of them.

Various people die until the disgruntled spirit behind it all is unearthed, so essentially if you have seen more than 2 recent Japanese horror films you can plot this film in the dark with your hands tied.The main attraction here is the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. So far I have been more impressed with his low key works like City of Lost Souls, however as One Missed Call plodded along I was yearning for his more renowned envelope pushing of Dead or Alive or the overly pseudoCronenberg style of Audition. Despite a lot of his films being essentially empty, at least they do have merits such as these, or at least something to keep your attention like Tadanobu Asano prancing about in shiny suits impersonating Johnny Depp. There is none of that in One Missed Call; there is just very little of credit the acting is bland and average, there is very little nothing, in all honesty in the way of scares or suspense, and in places it is just downright boring.However, there are moments where Miikes glacierlike sense of humour seeps through the bland commercialism; most notably with the instance of the TV show intent on filming the demise of one of the cursed subjects, and the TV programmer more concerned about his ratings than the girls life. But aside from this there is nothing to suggest it is Miike behind the camera; most notably his usual visual flair has vanished without a trace and that includes his famous gore, although it is more likely he just did not have any enthusiasm for the project, and I can understand why. One Missed Call is not offensively bad. It is just frustratingly average.Miike obviously loves directing. With his huge yearly output it is obvious he is not going to be 100 concerned about all his projects. But even with this in mind, One Missed Call felt like he was just paying the bills.","label":0},{"index":7945,"txt":"Something to Sing About was produced at Grand National Studios where James Cagney was working while under a contract dispute with the brothers Warner. He did two films for this B studio, neither of which rank high in the Cagney credits.One of the great losses to cinema is the fact that Jimmy Cagney did so few films that utilized his terrific dancing abilities. The two that come to mind immediately are Yankee Doodle Dandy and Footlight Parade. Two lesser films are The West Point Story and Never Steal Anything Small. Cagney himself said he never used to watch anything but his musicals in retirement. So why did he make so few of them?Well this one was all wrong. The plot of Something to Sing About concerns a hoofer who fronts for a band who is discovered and given a movie contract. There are the usual complications of a conniving studio boss and a conniving press agent played respectively and well by Gene Lockhart and William Frawley. His contract calls for a no marriage clause, so Cagney and band girl singer lady Evelyn Daw marry in secret. Then we get the complication of a publicity driven studio romance with screen leading lady Mona Barrie. I think you can figure where this is going.The most disappointing thing about Something to Sing About is the lack of dance numbers for Cagney. He dances briefly at the beginning and the end of the film and nothing in the middle. Evelyn Daw had a nice singing voice and the charisma of a ham sandwich. She got the musical numbers such as they were. I am sure the moviegoing public was paying their tickets to see Cagney dance. Also in addition to giving him some dance numbers a female dance partner would have been nice. He danced well with Ruby Keeler in Footlight Parade and with Virginia Mayo and Doris Day in The West Point Story. Were not Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell or Ruby Keeler available?No memorable songs came out of this. And Daws voice is waisted as well. She has a Jeanette MacDonald soprano voice which was so out of place with a swing band.No wonder Cagney went running back to Warner Brothers.

The Spy Who Shagged Me was a lot more commercially advertised and hyped about.OK I will admit, the first time I saw this film I thought it was very funny, but it is only after watching it two or three times that you see all the flaws. The acting was OK, but Heather Graham cannot act. Her performance did not seem very convincing and she was not near as good as Liz Hurley was in the first one. Those characters who bloomed in the first one, Scott Evil, Number 2 etc. are thrown into the background hear and do not get many standalone scenes. The film is simply overrun with cameos.In particular, I hated the way they totally disregarded some of the scenes in IMOM. When they killed off Vanessa at the start and had Basil sat that he knew she was a fembot all along. What was the point of that? They killed off Number 2 in the first one, and now they bring him back with no explanation whatsoever. This is supposed to be a spyspoof, I do not think any of the characters even hold a gun in the film. It just goes on a trail, further and further away from the point.The new characters are very unwelcome. The whole MiniMe make fun of my size joke gets old very quickly. Fat Bastard is just a lame excuse for grossout humour. In total there is about two or three good jokes. The rest are either tasteless or rehashed from IMOM.If this were the first movie of the series then I would probably be easier on it.

At times I actually had trouble telling some characters apart, as they were filmed from such a distance. Two hours in and I was totally past caring. As someone who is not only interested in music but is also very into the history and culture of China and is by the way no stranger to Chinese cinema, I could not engage with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth into.

Therefore, can thieves, rapists and murderers the Killer of this movie, Carl Panzram James Woods, is all three and worse be held fully accountable for their deeds? An interesting notion, but very difficult to bring to the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfying way. And this is where Killer A Journal of Murder falls very short. Although the film tries to put Panzrams behaviour into perspective, with flashbacks to his violent youth and dysfunctional upbringing, the viewer never gets the idea that Panzram is a victim rather than a culprit. Sure, the system is corrupt, with one mobster occupying the whole sick bay of Leavenworth Prison where most of the movie takes place, most prison guards are sadistic bullies, and the prison director something like a megalomaniacal despot. But why on earth does new prison guard Henry Lesser Robert Sean Leonard take such pity on Panzram? Even after having read his gruesome diaries? The movie offers some explanation Lesser witnesses Panzram being beaten to a pulp by the most sadistic and stereotypical guard, and is impressed by Panzrams intelligence though it is not clear why exactly Lesser thinks this man is so smart. Surely this is not enough to sympathize with a hostile man like Panzram, even though this movie tends to downplay his crimes and highlight his personality? Towards Lesser, Panzram is quite loyal, and the viewer is given the impression that for Lesser this outweighs all of the atrocities he has read about in Panzrams diaries. Does this man Lesser have so little friends that he takes at face value everyone who seems only remotely friendly to him? Perhaps it is Lesser who is a product of modern society, judging on appearance rather than substance.I can advise Monster, starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, as a movie which handles roughly the same themes with far more integrity and scope.BTW Killer looks as though shot for TV not so good","label":0},{"index":7963,"txt":"Carl Panzram lived an amazing life and scribbled down his memoirs on scraps of paper for possibly the only person who ever did anything selfless for him.

As Panzram grew huge and strong, he sought to take revenge for the wrong done to him as he traveled to South America, Europe and Africa, and it did not matter what people he raped, robbed, or murdered because we are all equally worthless.This film casts skinny James Woods as the rough neck, meanass, son of a bitch Carl Panzram who in the film is a drunk, overlydramatic and emotional, and who never mentions the joy of sodomizing men and boys. The film neither elaborates on anything else particularly of note about this world traveler and career prisoner like robbing former President Taft or being released from the Oregon prison as long as he gave his word to return. In short, I do not think Carl would be too happy.","label":0},{"index":7964,"txt":"I rented this movie yesterday and can hardly express my disappointment in little Laura Ingalls for getting involved in something so poorly produced.

Give me some Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, higher beings like Triskelions or anything but Medusins, these are very boring aliens to make an episode around. McCoy gets to utter his famous phrase He is Dead, Jim. Spock puts on the protective goggles when transporting the ambassador away but Kirk does not.

At least season threes next episodes would be Spectre Of The Gun, and Day of The Dove and others to follow, making Trek a decent show to watch in syndication where it would pick people like me up as avid fans. Personal observations, Trek loved to use the color purple, its kind of a pinkish purple, like when they are in the corridor outside the compartment, the gangway that is normally grey is now purple. We never had a purple bridge but its interesting to see, I noticed it in several episodes, it was done by a light filter and it works very well but in this episode, in the ships corridor is pretty lame.","label":0},{"index":7972,"txt":"Another weak thirdseason entry, Is There In Truth No Beauty? nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It is too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a mistake to ever show the alien, as its actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting buildup; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. For the longest time, I thought the aliens name was Carlos, which I found humorous, but I digress. Spock is required to mindmeld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, but when SpockKollos go back to end the mindmeld, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh.

You think he could have just walked in to the room with his eyes shut and phasered the box, too easy he takes the Enterprise into unnavigable space outside the galaxy before the boys could subdue him. Well, the ship is stuck in limbo, at that point they could have gone to the good lady doctorliaison and discussed it. Spock has to make a mind meld with the Medusan so we can get home.

So the beetch out of spite messes with the melded Spock causing him to forget to put on his visor which makes Spock go insane.

Unfortunately the most of the musicians featured in the concert did not converse the nuances of Leonards musical  literary manner. Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker  Beth Orton were the exceptions, even though Leonard highly values Rufus Wainrights interpretations of his songs.What particularly failed in this documentary was the ability of the filmmaker to allow the viewer to see who Leonard Cohen is and how these musicians connect to him. A lot is said in this respect, but the viewer is not drawn into the person Leonard Cohen. This failing is especially evident with the interviews with Bono and the Edge. They view Leonard as a special icon, but cannot translate their exact value of Leonard Cohen. The collaboration with U2 is a farce. The entire live registration looks like a rushed job. And just as in the whole film, only Leonard Cohen remains his part and can tell about his own part.The entire montage and screenplay is much like a high school extramural project. The use of effects such as echo, slowmotion or flashed images are ill placed. Some of the camerawork is dismal. Part of the score hardly recalls any associations I may have expected.

It is the same feeling many of you probably had listening in to some horrendous operatic versions of simple songs such as Lennons Imagine. Nothing, simply nothing gets close to the simplicity and directness of the original. If there is a form of art that does not need embellishments, it is Cohens art. Embellishments cast it in the street looking like the tasteless makeup of sex for sale.In this Cohens tribute I found myself suffering and suffering through pitiful tributes and awful reinterpretations, all of them entirely lacking the original irony of the master and, if truth be told, several of these singers sounded as if they had been recruited at some asylum talent show. It is Cohen doing a tribute to them by letting them sing his material, really, not the other way around they may have been friends, or his daughters, he could have become very tenderhearted and in the mood for a gift. Too bad it did not stay in the family.Fortunately, but only at the very end, Cohen himself performed his majestic Tower of Song, but even that flower was spoiled by the totally incongruous background of the U2, all of them carrying the expression that bored kids have when they visit their poor grandpa at the nursing home.A sad show, really, and sadder if you truly love Cohen as I do.","label":0},{"index":7983,"txt":"This film was a disaster from start to finish.

Only people who were really close to them and the killers know the truth behind all this.And for the end I just wanna say for all of ya Biggie and Tupac fans and family, this two men were and will be the greatest of all time, no matter how they lived their lives but PLEASE IN THE FUTURE TRY TO BE BETTER, LEARN AND LOVE EACH OTHER, THINK GOOD EVEN FOR THE ONES THAT Do not LIKE YOU, BECAUSE AT THE END...ITS NOT ABOUT HOW MANY MONEY OR FAME U COULD GET AND HOW FAST U COULD GET TO THE TOP, ITS ABOUT ACCOMPLISHING YOUR SELF TO THE FULLEST AND FEEDING YOUR SOUL, YOUR BODY AND MIND...BECAUSE IF U MANAGE TO DO THAT, YOU WILL BE LIVING A LIFE EVEN AFTER DEATH!!!! PEACE AND LOVE TO YA ALL!!!! RIP BIGGIE,2PAC,AALIYAH,LEFT EYE,JAM MASTER JAY AND THE OTHERS WHO MAKE A CHANGE IN THIS WORLD!!!!","label":0},{"index":7989,"txt":"As a fan of Notorious B.I.G., I was looking forward to this movie. I am unfortunate to see it is a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray Notorious B.I.G. A lot of the story follows Notorious B.I.G.s real son, Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B.I.G. as a kid. Unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father. Derek Luke is just as unconvincing as Sean Puffy Combs. In a nutshell, no one is convincing enough to play their roles here. The big problem with this are these are actual people they are playing. It was boring, and did not give any information about Notorious B.I.G. that fans and nonfans alike did not already know. I was especially disappointed with Angela Bassett, a very good actress wasted here as Voletta Wallace. The movie slugs and slugs along thinking that Notorious B.I.G. fans will spend tons of money on it. I am unfortunate to say that that happened. It is nowhere close to a good movie. I was expecting so much out of it, but unfortunately I did not get anything I wanted from this. I think you should definitely skip this one.","label":0},{"index":7990,"txt":"If this is supposed to be the black experience, let me out at either the front or back door.A mamas boy one day sees 2 young hoods walk by and from then on it is all down hill for him. Angela Bassett, the one shining grace in this film, plays his over protective, religious mother. Despite her anger at how his life has turned, by the middle of the picture, she really decides to accept this. She allows his friends to come in and suddenly it is all right to use the profanity as long as it is not in front of the children.This is a sad state of affairs regarding gangster rap. You knew where this film was heading.I literally laughed out loud when at the end, when Bassett is accompanying her sons body for burial, she states that while his life had been cut short at age 24, he had become a man. What man? He had been a convicted criminal, wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarity,and scorned society. That scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker, he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what goes on in our schools. The complete and utter lack of respect for the teacher.The east coast, west coast gang rap rivalry is never fully explained. All we see are guns blazing.A terrible picture doing nothing to prevent gang violence. What horrible role models are these rap singers and their foul music. The African American community should take umbrage at their very being. Who was this classless fat slob who portrayed Biggie? He made Rerun from the old television show look thin by comparison. I know it was the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant that changed this chubby little boy into the vulgar monster that he was. What a sorry state of affairs when this is called motion picture entertainment.","label":0},{"index":7991,"txt":"This film reminded me of The Sopranos, and not in a good way. David Chases seminal mob opera only ever put its foot wrong twice, the most jarring and inexplicable instance of which took place in its fourth season, when Junior Soprano went on trial for his life. Rather than pursue this riveting and pivotal plot line, the writers instead chose to completely ignore it, focusing instead on Bobby Baccalieris constant whimpering over his recently deceased wifes frozen pasta dish. When something of genuine interest happens in Notorious  for example that first, mysterious assassination attempt on Tupac Shakur that ignited the whole East CoastWest Coast feud in the first place, and ended up leading to the deaths of both Tupac and Christopher Wallace  the film treats it as just another bit of plot to plod through. Why exactly was Tupac so convinced that he was sold out by his own people? Did he alone nurture his subsequent affiliation with Suge Knight? And was Lil Kims transformation from prim office drone into sexobsessed, vampish diva really as banal as it appears here?None of these questions are even fleetingly addressed by the films screenwriters, who are far more interested in depicting Wallaces turbulent love life to zero compelling dramatic avail. These sequences including a brainfrazzlingly clich\u00e9d groupie indescretion in a hotel room are so toothless and bruisingly manipulative that the only real comparison to be made is with a network TV movie.The storytelling, in both structure and content, is simplistic and trite. But more fundamentally, as a biopic; as something designed to celebrate its subject and educate the uninitiated on the intricacies of their life and work; the film is almost entirely worthless. The reliance on meatandpotatoes genre plotting, coupled with the lifeless musical performances an area in which a film like this should soar, surely result in a film that appears to have been designed only to satisfy the whims and demands of those involved, leaving Wallaces questionable status as a giant in his field as the preserve of the easily persuaded and previously converted only. And the final twenty minutes, in which Wallaces posthumous cultural identity is broadly painted as being akin to that of a latter day saint, quite frankly made me feel like throwing up. On that score, much as with any other, Notorious is crass, calculating and compromised.","label":0},{"index":7992,"txt":"Not exactly my genre, this straighttoDVD street fight action is one I only encountered due to a friend putting it on whilst we had a few beers. I am relatively open minded, and quite a fan of Eamonn Walker, so I sat back ready to enjoy myself.Blood and Bone is the story of Isiah Bone, an excon who becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons which eventually unfold as the film progresses. Blah blah blah.What a tedious film. I understand that films like this do not rely hugely on plot, but do they have to stuff in such a silly, predictable and entirely stupid storyline? It may not be important, but by golly gum does it annoy me. Better no plot and pure action than a cl\u00edcheridden fleabag mongrel of a narrative. Infused with entirely unfounded and unachieving sentimental drivel, it is the cinematic equivalent of a thinskinned turkey stuffed with rotten innards. I should probably at this point mention what is, of course, the films drawing point the fighting. Even in itself, the fighting is rather poor. Bone manages to take out well established toughman street fighters in single punches a large oaf or two is the filmmakers laughworthy attempt to rectify this inconsistency; fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a foolish ploy. Even this is repetitive and stupid, arms broken and faces kicked with a steady alacrity that we get to see time and time again.A run of the mill, filmbynumbers movie which fully deserves its straight to DVD status, doing absolutely nothing new and everything we have seen time and time again. And not even particularly well.","label":0},{"index":7993,"txt":"A black guy fights ..... and supposedly wins .... yeah ... 110.

Umm, thats all there is to the name..Its so hard to find decent help, must have hired the black guys friends to help cause the low budget, low ineptness of this movie, has the cameras shadow trailing the first scenes....

Do not expect nothing more that just that.Decent acting and a not so bad direction..A couple of cameos from Kimbo and Carano...I was looking to see Carano a little bit more in this movie..she is a good fighter and a really hot girl.... White is a great martial artist and a decent actor. I really hope he can land a better movie in the future so we can really enjoy his art..Imagine a film with White and Jaa together...that would be awesome","label":0},{"index":7995,"txt":"This is one of the most hateful and cruel movies I have seen in a long time. Sadly I was duped into sticking with it, since Donald Sutherlands presence misleadingly gave it some credibility. That is the last time thatll happen.Lesley Ann Warrens character was annoyingly whiny and as stupid as they come. There were smarter characters than hers who were killed in the film. Thats just one of many things in this movie that made me ask, Where is the justice?Why is latenight cable so filled with sadistic garbage filled with pathological mayhem? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women, and seem to focus on them being terrorized and murdered. This film could have been every bit as suspenseful without being sick and twisted in the process. All it ends up doing is turning the viewers stomach with its sickness, and insulting the viewers intelligence.The cast is misleadingly good. My guess is that they BAGGED Sutherland first, and used him to lure the others like lemmings into this.I am kicking myself for wasting time, giving this piece of garbage a chance.","label":0},{"index":7996,"txt":"I will not mention any of the plot, because, although it would be highly predictable anyway, the one notable plot twist is given away everywhere, in the movie comments, in the plot summary here, and even in the synopsis on my Netflix envelope. I might have enjoyed it more if I had not known that. Maybe. This film has a deceptively good cast, most of whom did creditable acting with the rather limited material at hand, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren, and Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller parts. It was impossible to like William McNamara, but that was clearly by design. And there were a couple of quick nude scenes by the callipygian Lenore Zann. But none of this brings the slightest recommendation from me. Do not any of these fine actors actually read these scripts before signing on?","label":0},{"index":7997,"txt":"It is not uncommon to see U.S. remakes of foreign movies that fall flat on their face, but here is the flip side!!!

I must give credit to Liam for one thing, and that is making it clear that I made the right choice in changing my religion!","label":0},{"index":7998,"txt":"I just rented Creep and was not at all impressed.

But then again I could not think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the Creep? So many questions need to be answered.Someone mentioned references to the PS2 game Silent Hill and I can see similarities vaguely.Not a bad film, not a good one. judge for yourself.","label":0},{"index":7999,"txt":"My first question after seeing this film was, Why is the title LIAM? If the intent was to tell a story from the boys perspective, it was not carried out well. Of course there was the formulaic use of camera angles in the boys scenes, but much of the crucial action took place outside of his field of view. Having a main character unable to speak obviously suggesting the mute, powerless position of a child makes it difficult to give that character much depth.Melodrama is defined as dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotyped characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplistic morality, and conflict LIAM fits this definition to a T. The viewer is hit over the head with the typical stereotypes of the fire and brimstone Catholic Church in the stern school marm and the wellfed priest squeezing money from parishioners. A stereotype which is becoming very tiresome. What is morethe Jewish characters are money lenders and factory owners!Much of the film was predictable...Who did not think that we would see Theresa scrubbing the toilet after her mother had told her No daughter of mine will scrub another womans toilet! I am a fan of British realism if it is done well. In my opinion, LIAM is not.","label":0}]}
