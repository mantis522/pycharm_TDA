Frank Morgan, playing an unabashed golddigger, loudly complains to Cooper about his perceived penury at the hands of his family  including his daughter, Anita Louise. I am a fan of all 3 actors. Frank Morgan is to my mind a Hollywood treasure, Cooper a legend, and Louise a very lovely, versatile and underappreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role. I also have nothing against Teresa Wright, and while not blessed with great range, she usually delivers heartwarming performances.From a promising opening, the story slides downhill all the way to the end. I found nothing humorous about burning down the home of Coopers wouldbe inlaws. The butler in such a fastidious, nonsmoking household would never just blithely walk away, allowing Cooper to continue smoking, or alternatively he would certainly supply him with some means of disposing of his illtimed cigarette. Moreover, nobody with any common sense would permit himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of disposing of it. And finally, nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket! This whole sequence just made Cooper seem foolish and gauche. It is a poor contrivance  ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not laughter. The forced medical examination of Cooper is equally contrived. Nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent! That Cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny  it is absurd! Stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense, and that, too, is nothing to laugh about. Finally, the scenes of Coopers overly fastidious, neurotic attention to his babys feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies. But to me they just seem tedious and slow. The wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes, while paradoxically, the script writer went to sleep.The lines are just not in the script to generate humor. They just miss on all cylinders. The laughs come not a mileaminute, but more like a light yearaminute. The only time the movie has any energy or humor is when Frank Morgan is on camera.The scene that is totally wasted is when both of Coopers love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together. There is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine, but none of it was extracted.In the end, one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt. Predictably, it is the Anita Louise character, who gets jilted on her wouldbewedding night! While it is not on camera, that is her fate, and it is not particularly funny  even as a loose end. She had not done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic unlike Gail Patrick, say, in My Favorite Wife. Consequently, I was expecting perhaps hoping is a better word in the context of the film! for Anita Louise to enjoy a happy ending, too. The fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movies end really undermines the effect of the happy ending for Cooper and Wright.I kept waiting for something to happen, for the witty dialog so characteristic of movies of the era... And it never delivered. A good performance by Frank Morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here.","label":0},{"index":9006,"txt":"This screwy comedy seems very forced. Indeed, the actors TRY very hard to make a go of an essentially unfunny script. And, as a result it does not really go anywhere. The idea of a woman finding out she was pregnant after getting a quickie divorce just is not all that funny. And then, when Cooper sneaks off with the baby because he does not want it put up for adoption just seems terribly unfunny and it is really pushing hard to turn this into a comedy. It is really a shame, too, as the actors were more capable than the script and I found myself just bored by the whole mess.

From the utterly terrible acting performances and do not you, Oh that was done on purpose, you just do not get it me! to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of Rockford Files, this film was revolting. I viewed it with no illwill at the outset, and, in fact, expected a pleasant experience. But the misrepresentation of the southern characters, from the ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl to the lilting, comedic way their faith was portrayed, was inexcusable. Right down to it is end, which was completely devoid of any character sentiment, it failed in every place that OConnors book shined and resonated. The actors portraying the southern policemen may as well have been eating smothered hotdogs from NYC street stands and quoting Godfather. The one redeeming acting performance was Ned Beattys lively and deadon representation of Hoover Shoates, a religious conartist who hears Moates preaching the Church of Christ Without Christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities. OConnors powerful book is most wellknown for it is creepy, religious undercurrent that jibes the seemingly lifeless cadaver of Faith. Mr. Hustons film is a shameful mockery of the authors intentions, as they are understood by me and most of her fans, if I may be so bold as to say so. While I acknowledge that I cannot know exactly what the author wished to convey, I have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan. If I viewed Wise Blood the way Mr. Huston apparently did, I would have thrown it in the trash. For Flannerys sake, and mine, I forgive you, John Huston. The forgetting....that will take some time.","label":0},{"index":9008,"txt":"I realize that bringing a novel to the big screen is always problematic. That is the only positive thing I can say about this truly horrid adaptation.Have you read Wise Blood? It is an amazing book. Flannery OConnor wrote about the south as no one else has. She was a southerner herself, a devout catholic, and a remarkably gifted writer. In her first novel she wove together a dark and deeply disturbing tale of faith, doubt, and redemption with a macabre sense of humor and surprising evenhandedness. The characters in the book may seem outrageous to those who have not lived in the rural south, but I can assure you that such people do exist. Not only do they exist, they are human beings with families, feelings, and concerns like anyone else. Flannerys intentions were so often misunderstood  she was not lampooning these backwoods zealots  she saw in them the beautiful operation of what she would have called grace...even in the most violent, distressing, and maddening of circumstances. To read Wise Blood is to be washed over with a sense of dread and impending doom. Finally, it is to think long and hard about our judgments and preconceptions  our entire world view.None of this comes through in John Hustons Gilligans Islandlike adaptation. None. It is a farce. A bad farce. The entire film is saturated with a hauteur that turns the stomach. The acting is poor, the southern accents are fake and insulting. The filmmakers show no insight into the thinking of religious southerners. Ms. OConnors intense prose are reduced to sight gags and cheap, amateur theatre. The soundtrack is a mixture of hayseed silliness and Clockwork Orangestyle cheeseball electronics that does not fit the story or even the MOVIE. I was granted free admission to this movie and almost walked out. Truly, truly terrible.As an aside, I do not agree with Ms. OConnors religious views, and while I was raised in the deep south, years ago I made my way north and have not looked back. But the south is a beautiful place full of fascinating individuals like every other place on earth, and the cartoonish mockery with which southerners and their attitudes are dealt in this movie borders on offensive. If you are into being offended which I am not, then this movie most DEFINITELY crosses the line.I do not like to talk crap about an artists work  John Huston was a man that I did not know, and I am sure he was a sincere and gifted filmmaker, to which his respected place in film history attests. My views are clearly skewed by having read and loved Flannery OConnors work. So I do not claim to be coming from any other perspective. Maybe as a standalone film it works for cinephiles. But for Flannery OConnor fans  and, I might add, for selfrespecting southerners and openminded individuals of all stripes  this movie is a waste of time.","label":0},{"index":9009,"txt":"My wife and I thought that with this cast and director, the movie would have to be at least worth watching.

The idea that Crawford, Young and Tone are British but speak with American accents was, for me, impossible to get past  hard to believe this is England when no one talks with a British accent. There is zero chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and to echo a previous comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare their love for one another without any reason is ludicrous. There is no reason to care about any of the characters, which is why we threw in the towel halfway through.

He goes in the house, walks around and finally writes a note that he leaves there. This scene comes to nothing, and we learn nothing further about the house or its history.It is never explained exactly whose house this is, or where the people have gone, but we are given the impression Hazel has probably lived there at one time.Hazel decides to go to a city. Why  we do not know. Once he arrives in this city he writes down a name  address that he sees on a bathroom wall, and goes to visit this woman, who is a surprisingly fat hooker. He sees her for awhile and then he apparently is not seeing her anymore. Like everything else in this movie, it comes to nothing and serves no purpose.A young man named Enoch, tries to befriend him, but Hazel really is not interested, although they keep crossing paths.Enoch is about as crazy as you can get. One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimps are and talk at them insultingly.We never really know why Enoch behaves as he does, or why Hazel behaves as he does, beyond the fact Hazel had an overdose of old time scary, fundamentalist religion via his grandfather.Enoch later becomes enthralled with a man who dresses in a gorilla suit, and manages to get the gorilla suit from him and then runs around in it.Hazel, who is wound rather tight and seems to be in a constant borderline rage does a bit of street preaching. I got the impression he was trying to free himself from the untruths of the religion that had been drilled into him.He has several encounters with a preacher and his daughter, although their interactions never really make any particular point, and there is no plot line.Eventually Hazel succumbs to complete religious fervor and begins selfharming.It is a very odd film. Interesting in it is oddness but other than that it has absolutely nothing going for it.The cast does an outstanding job,but this film completely fails to deliver either a point of view or a storyline.The film also has the characters tossing around the N word from time to time with no connection to the rest of the dialog.2 stars","label":0},{"index":9011,"txt":"My first exposure to the Templarios  not a good one.

There is also information about the first film in this series.I caught this film on DVD, which someone gave as a gift to my roommate. It came as a set together with the first film in the Blind Dead series.This movie was certainly much worse than the first, La Noche del Terror Ciego. In addition, many of the features of the first movie were changed significantly. To boot, the movie was dubbed in English the first was subtitled, which I tend to find distracting.The concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the Knights Templar was involved in heinous and secret rituals. Upon discovery of these crimes, the local peasantry put the Templars to death in such a manner that their eyes can no longer be used, thus preventing them from returning from Hell to exact their revenge. We then jump to modern times where because of some event, the Templars arise from the dead to exact their revenge upon the villagers whose ancestors messed them up in the first place. Of course, since the undead knights have no eyes, they can only find their victims when they make some sort of noise.The Templars were a secretive order, from about the 12th century, coming out of the Crusades. They were only around for about 150 years, before they were suppressed in the early 1300s by the Pope and others. Because they were secretive, there were always rumors about their ceremonies, particularly for initiation. Also, because of the way the society was organized, you did not necessarily have church officials overseeing things, which meant they did not have an inside man when things heated up. And, because of the nature of their trials, they were tortured into confessions. The order was strongest in France, but did exist in Portugal and Spain, where the movies take place.Where the first movie had a virgin sacrifice and knights drinking the blood directly from the body of the virgin breast shots here, of course, this is a horror film after all, and then, once the knights come back to life, they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood; in this sequel, this all disappears. You still have the same scene redone, not the same footage of them sacrificing the virgin, but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink it from that. Thus, when they come back, they just hack people up with their swords or claw people to death, which I have to say is a much less effective means of disturbing your audience. There is also a time problem in the first film the dating is much closer to the Templars, where here they are now saying it is the 500 anniversary of the peasants burning these guys at the stake, which would date it around 1473. And the way that the Templars lose their eyes is much less interesting as well. In the first, they have them pecked out by crows. Now they are simply burned out, and in quite a ridiculous manner.Oh yeah, and maybe it was just me, but there seemed to be a lot of people from the first movie reappearing in this film despite having died. Not really a problem, since the movie is completely different and not a sequel in the sense of a continuation, but odd nonetheless.The highlight of this movie is the rich fellow who uses a child to distract the undead while he makes a break for the jeep. The childs father had already been suckered by this rich man into making an attempt to get the jeep, so he walks out and tells her to find her father. It comes somewhat out of the blue, and is easily the funniest scene in the film. Of course, why the child does not die at this point is beyond me, and disappointed for horror fans.I could not possibly recommend this film to anyone. It is not so bad that it becomes funny, so it just ends up being a mediocre horror film. The bulk of the film has several people holed up in a church, each making various attempts to go it alone in order to escape the blind dead who have them surrounded. When the film ends, you are not surprised at the outcome at all; in fact, quite disappointed. If you are into the novelty of seeing a Spanish horror film, see the first movie, which at least has some innovative ideas and not so expected outcomes.","label":0},{"index":9015,"txt":"This movie was so bad it was laughable.

In my opinion, this movie pretends to explore deep issues, but thrives on stereotypes and prejudices; with little true insight. What the people in the movie and therefore, the writer failed to see was grace. They failed to understand that God is the author of beauty and He is the Creator of passion and sexual gratification in the proper context of marriage bonds. To imply that the people of the society in which the story is based believe that nudity is sinful, and both the man  the woman enjoying the act of marriage is dirty, is just an oversimplification. Such stereotypes really do not exist, for even Jewish holy writings speak clearly of the caring husband who will seek his wifes pleasure before his own. Scripture says that a man ought to love his wife as his own flesh, and that no man ever hated his own flesh, but he nourishes and cherishes it. Even if you want to ignore the New Testament, the writers  characters completely ignore that there are passages such as the Song of Solomon in the Old Testament, and the even the book of Proverbs which says, Rejoice in the wife of thy youth, let her breasts satisfy you always! How can that be read in any way other way than that God knows, and approves of, and smiles on, the marital union and the enjoyment thereof? Real men do not ignore the value and needs of their wives. Those that do deny a very basic teaching of the JudeoChristian religion. God NEVER said those things. It is absurd. Sonia rebelled because of the misapplication of the teachings of the true God of Abraham. It did not need to be so. How sad. What Sonia desperately needed was TRUTH, not tradition.

The story originally was about only the Tone, Young, and Cooper characters, but MGM needed to put Joan Crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract, and Faulkner obliged by creating a female role. Crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her costars Young and Tone, leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraphlike shorthand that sounds like a Monty Python sketch Wuthering Heights performed in semaphore. Seriously, the almost entirely pronounless sentences make Ernest Hemingway read like Henry James.The film also reflects some familiar Faulkner themes, with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister as may be found in his Sanctuary, and elsewhere. When Young proposes to Crawford, in Tones presence, in lieu of an engagement ring ALL THREE exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another. The closeness of Tone and Young is also noticeable, especially as they go off to their Thelma  Louise fate. Frankly, it is creepy.Not as creepy to this New Yorker, however, as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach, Wellington, which Crawford cheerfully catches and which is shown gamboling over her handsI had to turn away! and Young turns into a gladiator. Blech.That being said, there are some nice performances. Young is particularly engaging in a scene where he is taken up in Coopers fighter plane, and Roscoe Karns is delightful as Coopers flying buddy. Tone, despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue, has a nice moment, dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy Youngs fate. Crawford, stripped of meaningful dialogue as well, mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic, which is quite a balancing act for one role.The battle scenesnot surprisingly, for a Howard Hawks filmare the most exciting part of the entire picture.

Michael Landes was noncharismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian. His chemistry with Alexondra Lee, as well as any supposed sexual attention, was all languid. Sure the show got a funny look but overall it was unfunny work. It is clear that there was nothing more interesting than its main idea. Among Evan Katzs other works as a cowriter and a coproducer like Seven Days before or 24 later this must be a low point !. Despite the distinctive personality, it managed to be a silly jest for most of the time. Therefore if that was there goal, so they made one of the silliest indeed !

They deliver pretty good performances, especially Rosanna Arquette and JeanMarc Barr. The story is somehow interesting. But I do not know, there is something about the movie that I do not like.

There is no such thing as spanglish... either you speak Spanish, or you do not.... and from what I heard... you do not. Pedro Albizo Campos IS NOT MLK to me. MLK was a great man. Campos is a great man to those that want independence which is 1. To the rest he as loco as Osama Bin Laden. Puertoricans that want independence are a bunch of fools.

Well, despite a good cast, this is one of the poorest written and most clich\u00e9d A pictures I have ever seen. Given the talent and money spent to make this film, it is shocking how slipshod the writing was. I knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film I found myself predicting EXACTLY what would happen nextand I was always right! And this is not because I am some sort of movie savant, but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it. In fact, it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clich\u00e9s all strung together! Also, I found it a bit irritating that Fred mistreated Carole so bad throughout the film and yet, true to convention, she came running to him in the end. Uggh! There is MORE suspense in a Lassie film will he bring people to rescue Timmy or will the rope he is dangling from break?.Despite the very, very tired and clich\u00e9d script, there were a few positives about the film. It was pretty cool seeing Fred look like a broken lush at the end of the filmit was pretty believable and he looked like he had not eaten, shaved or slept in days.

Well anyway, I anxiously sat with my popcorn to watch. I realized 10 min into it that my initial apprehension was right. Rosie Perez has little knowledge about what it is like to be Puerto Rican. This documentary is more a 1st hand, very very personal account on what it is like to be a Nuyorican..and all of what that entails. She like most of the Nuyoricans I know have a watered down, partial and sometimes twisted sense of history. How could they not..they live here. Yes, all of them are proud. As they should be! But a lot do not know the ins and outs of the REAL culture, history and political background or language for the most part. It all became very very apparent with her participation in the Vieques issue. Regardless of my personal take is on this issue..at least I know what the hell the fight is for. There is she is getting arrested for something she knew little about.. and only participated in because it was a Puerto Rican Cause I really do not understand how she is not embarrassed to admit to it. For those of you that are not Puerto Rican, please view this as a partial account of a womans journey of self discovery and acceptance. Do not take this as gospel...a lot of it is not even true. Please consider the source. Rosie is an actress; not a historian. This movie is not and should never be, for other Nuyoricans, the base for their information.

Very different cultures and should not be generalized to the Puerto Rican population. Rosie, before you make a documentary, you need to do the research. You also need to check and make sure your sources are credible. Puerto Ricans are not all loud and they do have class, which is one thing the documentary lacked to show. When I saw Rosie and Jimmie on the View and Rosie on Martha Stewart I was very excited about watching. I even made sure to let my parents know since they love Puerto Rico so much. After the first five minutes I could not believe how the documentary bashed the US and made Puerto Ricans look like a bunch of guinea pigs.

Puerto Rico has colleges and well known Universities, roads, cars, shopping centers, malls The largest Kmart and JCPenneys I have ever seen, restaurants, theaters, beaches, hotelsRitz, Hilton,etc., casinos, churches, agriculture, Auto Expresso, and restaurants just to name a few. Poverty? NOT 50 of the population is. Puerto Rican culture is about family, music, food, celebrating, and trying to move forward not backward. Oh, and new cousins do not just pop up out of no where. No that is not a Puerto Rican thing, that is a ghetto thing. We are not bastards. Parents of Puertorican descent who would like to teach their children about Puerto Rico should invest in a trip with the family so they can see first hand what Puerto Rico is all about. They will see its beauty, people and culture. Please do not show them this documentary because it will only cloud their minds with negativity.

It may be just a dumb kids movie but it is the 1 most frequently requested film title in online movie forums, requested by people who remember the story but cannot remember the title. Therefore what follows is a muchneeded, detailed plot description, since I have not been able to find such a description anywhere else on the Internet.A typical 2story house is shown in suburbia. 7yearold Bridget narrates about suspecting something is going on since she and her 11yearold brother Andrew are getting presents from their parents for no apparent reason. Bridgets present is a stuffed penguin that she immediately names Sweet William. Bridget describes her relatives Aunt Ruth, a bossy nurse taking care of grandmother, Grams the hugging grandmother who makes dolls out of socks, and her brother Andrew, who is into electronics and is grumpy. Grams accidentally hangs up on the lieutenantgovernor, which indicates she is getting in the way while living with the family. The two children eat breakfast while the adults discuss moving Grams to a retirement home. Bridget makes an awfullooking pancake sandwich containing cereal, eggs, bacon, strawberries, and syrup, as Andrew looks on incredulously. The two kids then discuss Grams, and Andrew says bluntly that Grams is being put out to pasture. Bridget talks with Grams in the attic, has a play tea party with Sweet William in her bedroom, then a living doll unexpectedly pops out of her bedroom closet mirror.Bridget and the living doll become acquainted. The curlyhaired living female doll is named Huggins and lives in Huggaland. Bridget gives Huggins a baseball cap from Andrews room. Huggins hides under some laundry when Bridgets mother comes by, then the mother throws the laundry into the washing machine with Huggins in it. Bridget rescues Huggins and dries her off with a hair drier. They discuss the problem with Grams getting old and having to move away, Huggins says Bridget could talk to the bookworm in Huggaland about it, since he knows everything. They step through the mirror to visit Huggaland, but one of Bridgets tennis shoes becomes lodged in the mirror.Rather than walk around with one shoe, Bridget goes without shoes in Huggaland. They immediately meet Hugsy, a curlyhaired living boy doll in Huggaland. Huggins gives Hugsy the baseball cap. They also meet Tickles, Bubbles, Impkins, and Tweaker, and all the dolls sing a song while sitting on a bridge. Hugsy takes Bridget and Huggins in his hugwagon to see the bookworm, who lives atop a stack of giant books. The bookworm consults the old encyclopedia and finds that old age can be cured by eating the fruit of the youngberry tree. However, only one such tree exists, and it is in the country of Shrugs, ruled by the mad queen of quartz. The only way to travel to Shrugs is to jump down a deep hole that is located inside a nearby giant book.Bridget and the two dolls gulp three times, jump down the hole, and tumble out. Soon they walk down a sideways sidewalk, hear the sea of glass breaking, and fall off the sidewalk when the sideways gravity ends. They encounter the hairy behemoth, which looks like a mastodon, has four tusks, and breathes fire out its trunk. But Hugsy boldly goes over and hugs the behemoth, who thereby turns into a baby elephant whose name is Hodgepodge. Hodgepodge had been under a spell by the queen, and owes Hugsy a favor, so they all ride on Hodgepodges back to the castle. They enter the castle, are surrounded by trolllike beings, the queen Queen Admira comes, and Bridget asks for a few youngberries. The queen refuses, then eats one for herself, and brags about her own youthful good looks while looking in a hand mirror. Hodgepodge faints when the queen says he should be digested. The queen is upset when Bridget mentions that wicked witches should have warts, so the queen freezes Bridget and orders the three others to be taken to the dungeon. But the queen carelessly leaves the key to the youngberry trees dome by the lock to the domelifting apparatus.Hodgepodge wakes up in the dungeon and uses his noodle trunk to pull the jails door down, thereby freeing himself and the two dolls with him. They find Bridget standing petrified, the dolls hug her, which causes Bridget to be revived. Before they flee, Bridget finds the leftbehind key to the youngberry tree dome, lifts the dome off, and they pick some glowing youngberries and put them in a jar. The queen catches them, but the queens arm is trapped under the descending dome while reaching for the key that Bridget left on the ground. The queen suddenly turns very old since she is deprived of the youthgiving berries, and appears to die. Soon Bridget steps back through the mirror into her bedroom but trips on the bottom of the mirror, spilling the berries onto her floor, and the berries quickly vanish into smoke, one by one. Her mother calls for her and Andrew to say goodbye to Grams, who is leaving for a retirement home. Andrew drops his usual grumpy, standoffish facade and hugs Grams, telling her he loves her and that he does not want her to go away. Their father is moved, and decides to keep Grams there after all, and everybody hugs and cries, including Aunt Ruthie, who had been the main person pressuring Grams to move out.Andrew asks Bridget for his St. Louis Cardinals cap, Bridget starts to explain how she gave it to Huggins of Huggaland, but Andrew does not want to listen to what he believes are her fantasy stories, so he turns around to look for it in her bedroom. One of the dolls secretly hands the cap back through the mirror to Bridget, Bridget puts the cap on Andrews head, Andrew is mystified, and leaves her bedroom without saying anything. Bridget cheerfully waves at the mirror.","label":0},{"index":9037,"txt":"...in an otherwise ghastly, misbegotten, wouldbe Oedipal comedy.I was the lone victim at a 720 screening tonight 3 days after the movie opened , so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warnings.The bloom is off Jon Heders rose.

The only really funny thing I found in this film was Derek the wannabe black guy, but other than that the jokes were recycled crap that we would all heard before.Being of halfSamoan decent, I wanted to see how the film was going to deal with Polynesian representation. It was a complete ballsup  I know it is a supposed comedy, but I did not feel like the characters had anything new to say about Polynesian identity, even if it was in a tongueincheek manner. I was most disappointed with the ending of the film and the resolution of the characters relationships  Mikaele was the player who only messed around with white women, comes to slightly turn his ways when the Dusky Maiden comes to town, has an epiphany that maybe he should start looking for a stable relationship, then at the very last minute rejects it and accepts his position as a Polynesian Playboy for palagi women. I did not understand why they did this.All in all, it was very disappointing. My whole family went to see it expecting to have a good laugh, but ended up being really bitter about paying to see it at the cinema. The jokes are lame at best, the acting, particularly of Sefas girlfriend, APPALLING, and honestly I would have been happy if I had got my hands on one of those pirated copies of the film to save myself the 15 ticket price.I think the only good thing to come from the movie is that it is the second step behind No. 2, of course, a far superior film to this one in the birth of Polynesian cinema.

The plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a dorm at Christmas time. As they are in a slasher, someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie. The fact that this movie was on the Video Nasty list is bizarre because, despite a few gory scenes, this film is hardly going to corrupt or deprave anyone, and gorier slashers than this Friday the 13th, for example did not end up banned.

A lawyer makes more sense since he ends up representing Jabez Stone against the devil himherself he was a man in the story, but was a woman in the movie in a trial where both of their souls are on the line. As an editor, it does not seem likely that Daniel Webster would have the skill to do this.The acting was decent by all except for Alec Baldwin and Dan Aykroyd. These are two actors that I like, they just did an awful job in this movie. It was as though they thought they were acting in a comedy, but the movie was more a serious one than a comedy. This might be partly due to the fact that the movie was filmed with a particular vision in mind, and was then reedited by somebody else. Given this fact, it is surprising that it was at all coherent. I was surprised to see a fair amount of SNL cast members in the movie, which further leads me to believe it may have originally been filmed with the intention of it being more of a comedy.All in all I would have to say it was not completely awful, but it was not much good. If I could get the hour and a half back and do something else with it, I would. The ending was especially disappointing. As in the original story, Daniel Webster defeats the devil in the trial. Jabez then starts out again at the beginning of the movie...literally, we are just brought back to the first scene with Jabez, and then the movie abruptly ends. It actually looked as though they just replayed Jabez first scene over and called it the end. There is no indication that Jabez has the benefit of any of the knowledge or experience he gained, so who is to say he did not just repeat his mistakes over again, and perhaps over and over in an endless loop? It was an extremely disappointing end and did not make a lot of sense.

There are some funky elements here and there, and obviously the flick did have a decent budget.The opening title sequence is cool with its colored negative run through a cheap TV look. The dialogue is always hilarious. Near the beginning of the film, the horse and buggy driver gets out to move a dead tree stump in the middle of the road. WHAT STRENGTH! says Our Hero. Funny, then, that this dude should later not be able to fight off the wacky woodsmen when they come to make freaky fun. You will completely forget that this guy was even in the movie until he crops up again later near the end. That is how memorable these characters are.The best part about Mansion of Madness, however, has to be the wacky music and screwball hijinks that the good guys have to endure. It is like bad cartoon music that a three year old would find enjoyable. And why all the weirdo slapstick, anyway? I would say my fave moment had to be when the horse and buggy is ambushed by the forest freaks when they pull a stupid looking homemade ghost up by a stick in the middle of the road and make the buggy stop. What the hell? Oh yeah, there is plenty of boobies to be seen, too, for those of you that dig such things. Boobies, bad dialogue, and wacky music. That best sums of Mansion of Madness for me. It is well worth at least one viewing, and may be a lot better if you have had a few to drink or whatnot. I cannot say I was ever bored watching it, but I cannot deny that it is also a barrel of poop. Kinda like Magical Mystery Tour but with a plot, but not. Hmm.And Mr. Chicken PWNZ.","label":0},{"index":9084,"txt":"Although I rated this movie a 2 for showing a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror film it was a 10 on the unintentional funny scale. I could not figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were but I did not care because I knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter. Dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie but I believe this is because they started filming without a script. The fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile. It does not matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be confused with enjoyment.

And as he talks, loonies run amok here and there doing nothing especially productive. While there is SOME action here and there and some of it quite disturbing, it is amazing how dull and cerebral the whole thing islacking life and energy, which is odd for a horror flick. Even a guy who thinks he is a chicken and dresses like one becomes rather tiresome. The further this tour takes the guest, the more disturbing it becomes until ultimately you realize that the inmates have taken over the hospital and are torturing their keepers. Yet again, despite this twist, the film is amazingly lifeless in many placesparticularly when it moves very slowly as a bizarre ceremony is taking place or people are just wandering about the set. Only when the workers from the asylum found in a prison cell, starving, does the film have any real impact. Considering this plot, it sure is hard to imagine making it boring, but the people who made this cheap exploitational film have!

I begin this review by asking this question because the film that I just witnessed, Hollywood Shuffle, was neither funny or rather dramatic. While it tried so hard to make a point, because of this lack of definition comedy or drama, the clever themes and pointed remarks were lost. While I am a strong believer that there is too much racial profiling happening in Hollywood, even today, I do not believe that Townsends directorial debut did much to stop it. Instead, I feel it only added more fuel to the fire. Townsends comic timing in this film was disastrous due to the fact that the elements he was supposed to be making fun of, he was instead promoting and vice versa. The parts that were supposed to be serious were somehow destroyed by the poor lack of funny comedy. Townsend had a decent concept with this film, but sadly the execution is what ultimately hurt this film. If you watch the preview before the film which I constantly do, you will immediately get the wrong impression of what you are going to see. The preview gives the impression of a very intelligent, comic film that prides itself on the intelligence of the viewers, but the actually film could not be further from the truth.The main problem with Hollywood Shuffle is not story itself because it is lacking in elaboration; it is Townsends direction. He had a wonderful concept with this film. Exploit the Hollywood that exploits our race. Decent idea, but why could not he execute it very well? The first reason is that his ideas are too random and sporadic. The structure of this film was like watching a heart attack on a monitor at the hospital, we are literally everywhere without any warning or map. It was obvious that Townsend had quite a bit to say, but only a short amount of time to do it in. So, instead of defining his characters, developing his themes, and actually creating a smart film, he just throws it all together and prays that it works. Sadly, it does not. Instead of a smart comedy, we have a hodgepodge of so many ideas, comedic skits, and underused actors that this film goes from decent to nearly unwatchable. What hurts Townsend the most are his brief, attempt to be funny, interruptions throughout the film. From battling a villain known as Jerry Curl to parodying Siskel  Ebert, Townsends attempt to poke fun while speak a message about the film industry falters. This is because these small intermittent skits actually distract from the central focus of the film and actually destroy internally. While Townsend seems to be trying to make a joke about life in Hollywood, he actually is simply connecting to every stereotype and clich\u00e9 in the book. What could have been beautiful satire transforms into simply generic humor that never quite stands apart from the rest.So, if you find yourself not laughing at the humor of this story, perhaps there is some comfort in knowing that some of the Wayans brothers are around to help spice up this dull story. WRONG! The Wayans are in this film, but Townsend demonstrates that he has the ability to even bring the worst out even in this entertaining family. Definitely in their preIn Living Color moments, we see that comedy was something that all needed to constantly improve upon. Perhaps it was Townsends direction, or just maybe this atrocious story, but these typically funny comedians were obviously underused and ignored when it came to critics of this film. I just thought that with the talent pool that Townsend had to pull from that Hollywood Shuffle would have been funny, bright, and a true stab at this obvious Hollywood dilemma. Sadly, it was none of the above.Finally, I would like to say that this was a workable film. There were some moments while they were few and way far between that had a smile on my face, the final product just did not settle well with me. Townsend can be funny, but in this film it just felt like he was playing against himself, instead of through his personal experiences and troubles. I realize that he was probably speaking the truth, but it never came through as that. Instead, we are threaded through a weak story, which supports itself with idiotic flash clips that may have worked for a sitcom, but surely did not work for this film. Even for those that comment that this was his directorial debut and that he was learning from this film, I would have to disagree. If you are starting fresh, either have a tight script or defined themes. Townsend had neither of these, and combined with the inability to control his actors, he just failed in a ball of flames.Overall, this was rather disappointing to watch. It reminded me of a grade school Spelling Bee where it is finally your childs time to spell. The word is tough, but as the first two to three letters come out, you think that it is going to work perfectly, but then there is that random P and silent R that forces your excitement to come tumbling down. That is how I felt with Hollywood Shuffle. At first, I saw the potential, I saw the theme and the motive behind the picture, but through fuzzy and inexperienced technique and after the first couple of scenes, I experienced that deep fall feeling. Townsend sank his own ship on this one, and I do not think Hollywood Shuffle will ever resubmerge as a pivotal moment of Hollywood cinema.Grade  out of ","label":0},{"index":9094,"txt":"well i do not know what people saw in this movie i do not know. i saw this movie yesterday and i got a severe headache. other than few good dialog there is nothing in this movie.the big b rt now is preaching to fall in love with girls of half of you age. i did not like the movie at all. i wanted to give 1 rating but giving 3 as i like the role of the small girl who is called sexy by AB. my word DONT WATCHsave your self donot watch this movie.save time and money.","label":0},{"index":9095,"txt":"The subject this latest admanturnedmovieman tries to tackle in his debut adventure is quite an ageold topic of discussion by almost any cultural standard  timeless romance pun intended.However, the exploration and exploitation for Desi auds falls woefully short as the usual inclinations to pepper, spice and sugar up the usual masala mix of bg score, dialog, dance, drama, etc creates a nicelooking package with not much inside.In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen scene has been repeated at least 89 times.

This is a movie that deals in nasty, threadbare stereotypes instead of characters, preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting, and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought, wit or feeling. In short, it is no different from 90 of Hollywood product. But it is the racial angle that makes Set It Off a particularly saddening example of contemporary filmmaking. Posing as a celebration of sistahood, the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating AficanAmerican gangsta stereotype. The gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag. Not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all African Americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the Man, it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else. Worse, Set It Off exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure. Serious racerelated social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery, then they are ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished, the LAPD turns out to be a bunch of caring, guiltridden liberals tell that to Rodney King, and aspirational good sista, Jada Pinkett Smith, follows the path of upward mobility out of the hood and into a world of middleclass selfindulgence opened up for her by her buppie bankmanager boyfriend. Set It Off illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film, pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the hood while all the time despising it. While the likes of Shaft and Superfly in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed wellworn plots, they had a freshness, an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch.

It appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence. This makes the DVD even more pointless because, let us face it, a slasher movie shorn of violence is a waste of time. For slasherfilm and video nasty completists only.","label":0},{"index":9110,"txt":"We all knew even before it aired, the Ron Moore miniseries is no Battlestar Galactica. That is fine. It just means it must stand on its own. It cannot lean on Battlestar Galactica. If it is any good, it is good on it is own merits, and Ron Moore has something to be proud of. If reports are true, this is what Moore wanted. However, if his miniseries rots, he has shamed all the excellent actors that performed onscreen, not to mention the myriad offscreen personnel. And this is what he is done.Yes, this miniseries is no remake. I would not even call it a reimagining. It is a new production, inspired by Battlestar Galactica. It does not take place in the Galactica universe, with the same places and jargon and technology. It does not tell of the Galacticas search for the thirteenth tribe. Nor does it rely on the legends and mysteries that underpinned Galactica. Ron Moores miniseries is a spaceopera, action flick with a ceremonial nod to Battlestar Galactica.Maybe I should say, just another spaceopera, action flick. Because as plots go, his has little that is original, or even interesting. I could relay the whole thing to you without a spoiler warning. But I will not inflict that on you. I will just hit the most important point. Ready now? Here it is Just watch the trailer. It will tell you everything there is in the story.Yes, creations of man turn on man and seek to destroy man. I guess they forgot Azimovs rules, again. They look like humans, so there is the whole aliensamongus thing. At least there is no timetravel. Oh, and lots of fighting scenes and random acts of sex and violence. The end result was that when Moore did draw from Galactica, that ceremonial nod, it came off more corny than respectful. I mean, could not he even think up anything of his own?From the first few minutes, I wanted to watch something else. I did not care about any of Moores characters, since I could not identify with any of them. This fact hit me in the face when the Cylons began their attack. Armageddon on a planetary scale, and I did not give a damn. How depressing.Moores heroes when faced with an insurmountable obstacle, instead of overcoming it, rather tucked tail and saved their own butts. After all, it was the only way to save humanity, yadda yadda yadda. They took the safe way out, rather than risking their own lives to defend others. At least disgust is not apathy.But in the end, the Ron Moore miniseries was just activity without purpose, a movie on a treadmill, forever running yet going nowhere. And I just wanted it to be over. And by the time it was over, my lifeforce had been sucked from me. Against my own will, I was turning into a mindless, soulless zombie, probably of the type to which this miniseries would appeal. I needed to replenish myself. I needed toand I swear this is trueI needed to watch an episode of Babylon 5. Two episodes, in fact, and I felt much better. And happier.","label":0},{"index":9111,"txt":"Do not you just hate it when you order steak but the restaurant gives you chicken?Such is how I felt watching this socalled Battlestar Galactica. Arguments can be made over its quality but the fact remains, it is NOT what the fans ordered.Imagine if you were sitting down at that proverbial restaurant I mentioned. You have waited years for them to bring back their famous New York Strip steak which you loved. When your meal arrives, you find they have applied the name New York Strip to a chicken dish. You complain but the waiter merely states but ze cheeken, ees really GOOD zir! Do you really care if the chicken is good? You wanted New York Strip  a STEAK! The waiter then explains, you zee zir, ze chef wanted to to do, as you zay, zomezing NEW. We felt ze cheeken would be more popular zo we gave it the name of our previous delicious deesh. You ask if you will ever find the original New York Strip on the menu in the future but are informed that because the restaurant HAS a dish called New York Strip now on the menu, you will never see the original New York Strip  ever again.Such is the case with creating something NEW and slapping the Battlestar Galactica namesake on it. This mini series is an affront to all fans of the original show! It is a shame the production team put in charge of this new version obviously held contempt for the original. The team put in charge of resurrecting BG should have LOVED the original series  seeking to improve what the fans loved, not try to shamelessly sell this new series by exploiting the Battlestar Galactica name.If SciFi Channel wanted to give us a NEW show, then DO so! Give it a new name! Do not use the name we fondly remember in an attempt to lure in viewers. That effectively robs us of the chance to see any semblance of the original in the future.We have been waiting for 25 years to see what we knew as BG because we LIKED something about the original! We did not simply want the NAME and remnants of the basic concept. There are things we LOVED about the original series!Sadly, probably the BEST elements of the original were those which were omitted. Sure, the original BG was imperfect and could have used some updating. This mini series, however, was not an improvement in any regards but the special effects which were good but not anything unusual by todays standards.Many viewers will debate back and forth about the quality of this NEW show but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dream.That being said... I shall offer some comments about the merits of this new mini by itself not in comparison to the originalThe battle sequences were the best part. Effort was obviously put into making the effects more real in appearance and less wow  look at that effect. I would not say these sequences were exceptional by todays standards yet they were in keeping with madeforcable original movies. What was the deal with this pseudolivecam? Some views tried to fake the effect of a real camera with lagging tracking and jerky zooms. However, it was overused considering there was no apparent SOURCE of these cameras. The infinitely more intelligent series, Babylon 5, is the only instance I have seen such live cams used effectively, when we were supposedly witnessing action from Security Cams.The script, you ask? The script felt like it was written by a teenager, FOR other teenagers. The characters felt cardboard and stereotypical. Indeed, the whole story felt pieced together from other wellknown stereotypes. The only good features of the entire story were those few elements which were preserved from the original series. It was obviously dumbed down for digestion of your average TV audience.The human interaction was pitiful. Rather than drama based on subtle looks, expressions and fine timing, every moment of human tension was exaggerated to the point of being so obvious they lost all ability to move any refined viewer. Such was obvious in any interaction between Adama and son. The director must have been trying to make sure the most dense and unfeeling viewer would not miss it even if not paying attention. Sorry, but real humans do not behave like the continually.I would not have considered this a BAD show had it stood on its own. Nothing great; it will never be revered by true SciFi fans or artisans, but it would be watchable by the masses. I personally could have lived without it, though. I only watched it to see how it really DID capture the spirit of the original. How this mini series will always be remembered is as a symbol of how quality in storytelling has been cast aside to appeal to greater numbers. How even SciFi Channel has dumbed down its productions to cater to the masses as opposed to its true niche market, the Science Fiction fans. It will be the time we asked for steak and they insisted on giving us chicken, despite our complaints.I leave you with only one thought  NO MOORE.","label":0},{"index":9112,"txt":"The most horrible retelling of a great series. It should not have been named Battlestar Galactica, because it is only the same in name alone. Too many changes to just have changes. You have characters turned from male to female, black to asian to cylon all in a way to attract female audiences, when there was already strong female characters that could have just been made stronger. Gone are the egyptian feeling. Gone are the quest for earth. The lack of cylons to go to terminator rejects takes away from the film, especially when one is made a fembot. Granted the original show had a lot of cheese to it, but it had a large following. They tried to hold onto this following but give the fans nothing to work with and basically spit in their face as they make it their own story. Changes are good, when they make something better, not to just make them.","label":0},{"index":9113,"txt":"Rating 4 out of 10As this miniseries approached, and we were well aware of it for the last six months as SciFi Channel continued to pepper their shows with BG ads, I confess that I felt a growing unease as I learned more.As with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time, different people go to it to see different things. In this regard, when people think of Battlestar Galactica, they remember different things. For some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor. For others, it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time. Many forget the state of special effects during the late 70s, especially those on television. For some the memories resolve around the story arc. Others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they faced.Frankly, I come from the latter group. The core of Battlestar Galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire. Yes, evil. The Cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it. While base stars were swirling around, men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources, and somehow they managed to survive until the next show. They did not survive because they had better technology, or more fire power. They survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next show.The show had its flaws, and at times was sappy, but they were people you could care about.The writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this. In some ways he took the least significant part of the original show, the characters names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction. Since that was their goal, they can be judged on how well they accomplished it failure. It was far from a reinvention. In fact it was in many ways one of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time. It borrows liberally from STTNG, STDS9, Babylon 5, and even Battlefield Earth. I find that unfortunate.Ronald D. Moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade, and has made contribution to some of the most popular television Science Fiction that you could hope to see. One of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the Enterprise D  E. That was the inviolable rule of Roddenberrys STTNG. Like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority, Ron Moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master Gene Roddenberry. Here, instead of writing the best story possible, he has created a dysfuntional cast as I have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could. Besides being dysfunctional, some of it was not the least bit believable. Anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days in hack, they could have gotten execution, and they never would have gotten out the next day. It would not have happened, period, especially in time of war.The thing that I remembered most of Ron Moores earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of Capt. James Kirk. He killed Capt. Kirk, and, alas for me, he has killed Battlestar Galactica.","label":0},{"index":9114,"txt":"I have yesterday seen the second part. And I must say, it was actually better then the first one. At the begin, I realized, It is actually a sequel, not a remake but not a good one. I do not like the old movies and series of Galactica, because the cylons saw like toasters just as it was mentioned in this new movie and were completely harmless for the old galactica. This movie turns the sides  the Humans were harmless but the whole movie was for me completely chaotic and stupid. Many scenes were unnecessary, for instance the story of the computer expert  completely a crap. If I were a scriptwriter I would leave him die in his house, killed by the cylon woman. And the evacuation from the planet? Oh, please if it would be bombed by 50 Megatons why exactly 50 MT?? nukes, they would be dead killed by the radiation. And how is it actually possible that the big fleet of cylon was completely hidden before the attack? Aha, it was possibly this computer virus, created by the cylon  the script was probably written by tenyearsold school boy. The good side of the movie is, that the humans are at last defeated!! Really defeated, the population is near the extinction children are dieing  two times explicit in the movie 1. a baby!!! maybe one month old and a girl in age of max ten  what a violence.... And the badasses won and I think it is the first time in such scifi galaxy fight movie. I also appreciate the design of the cylons not only of the humanoid cylon a good job with these ships  I like the design of the ships by both of them  human an cylons. The human ships are a good never version of the old ones. And galactica  really pretty with these docks, I liked that. But this is all, only the design is not enough. The acting was really bad, the whole plot was expectable only two things not  the humancylon on the ragnardocks and the humancylon at the end.The dialogs were trivial and in the Slovak dabbing just stupid, but that is not fault of the movie. The whole movie looked like a pilot film for a series, but who would shoot such series? What it would be about?

Characters that I found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer. Another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket, he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting, instead, the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste, I was disappointed in his part in the end. As far as the true identity of the killer goes, when the identity was released as to who he was, I just laughed, but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed.

The box art for the video markets it as a fun throwback to 1950s giant bug movies. In reality, it is a transparent bargain basement ripoff of Aliens.The producers clearly wanted to make an ALIEN picture, but they must not have had much money. In fact, it does not look like they had ANY money, really. I hope everyone got paid who worked on this thing.The basic plot is retainedgroup of people isolated with murderous insectoid creatureand an earthbound location is inserted for budgetary reasons, I presume. Instead of setting the film in space, where no one can hear you scream, they set the film in a hospital, where everyone can see your budget laid bare. The amusing thing about Blue Monkey and there is only one thing amusing about it is, the filmmakers did not abandon the ALIEN aesthetics. Even though we are in a hospital, we still have an improbably cavernous annex where science fiction experiments are being conducted, in this case the venerable growth hormone plot device. The annex also doubles as a boiler room or something, so we can have an explanation for the monster seeking out the warmth. The boiler room is so large that it is laced with multileveled steel catwalks, perfect for allowing slime to drip down between the slats.The idea is that a man working in a greenhouse is attacked by a drooping flower from a rare imported plant that grows in an exotic location. He touches it and says Ow, so we know he is been hurt. The cut on his finger causes him to lapse into unconsciousness in a matter of minutes, and at the hospital he gives birth to a white worm through his mouth I guess in an ALIEN picture this would be called the mouthburster?. The worm is isolated, but some naughty little kids leukemia patients sneak up on it and accidentally give it some experimental growth hormone. You know everyones in trouble when some fornicating hospital staff workers are attacked by a camera on a crane, and pretty soon a maintenance man finds some obligatory cocoons, right before he is grabbed by a pair of semiconvincing insectoid arms. The rest of the movie is dominated by the semioffscreen monster, semiobscured by the semidarkness.Which brings us back to ALIEN. How, you ask, can a movie set in a hospital incorporate all those flashing strobe lights that are always in the ALIEN movies? No problem...a power outage or something causes the electrical system to go awry, which apparently causes strobe lights to blossom in every room of the hospital and flicker constantly throughout the movie. This doubles as a convenient cloak for the lessthanspecial effects although the bugs are pretty neat looking, they do not move too well, and the baby bug looks charmingly like a Cootie toy.OK, so what ALIEN bases have not we covered...OH, water dripping down the walls! Check...we will divide the massive hospital into two parts, then send some of the characters through the damp, drippy basement to get to the other side. Problem solved, we now have the opportunity for numerous foreboding tunnel shots. And do not forget the fog...well, you never really need an excuse for this in horror movies, do you? OK, maybe inside of a hospital you do, so we will create smoke by having lots of things spark  burn.I have not said anything about the negligible acting, not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow. I take it Blue Monkey was supposed to be lighthearted and fun, and if so then it is a nice try, but the pieces do not come together and the movie ends up being a real drag.

Somehow the cop gets paired up with one of the female doctors, as well as an entomologist who is brought in. There are several young kids wandering around the hospital, who I suppose we are supposed to find adorable, but who are extremely annoying little brats.

The title on the box said Insect and the illustrations on the back made clear that it is just another insignificant and poorly produced 80s horror movie. They can surely be fun, of course, as long as do not expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you are not irritated by seeing a giant amount of cheesy makeup effects. Just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy viewing is substandard here in Blue Monkey! The plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal, the acting performances are painful to observe and there is a total lack of suspense. Following the alwayspopular trend of bigbug movies, Blue Monkey handles about a new and unknown insect species that wipes out the doctors and patients of a remote hospital. The makers could not be more evasive about the actual origin of this gigantically oversized critter! All we know is that it is not from outer space and it initially crawled out of a tropical plant. Other than this, there is absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect all of a sudden comes from! Like I said, do not get your hopes up for an intelligent screenplay. The first half of the film is entertaining enough, with some nice gore and the introduction of a couple deranged characters an 80yearold blind and alcoholic lady! but the second half when the entire hospital is put to quarantine is dreadfully boring. It is also near the end that Blue Monkey begins to exaggeratedly ripoff older and better films. Approaching the climax, they apparently ran out of budget as well, since the lighting becomes very poor and the guy in the monster suit is not very well camouflaged anymore. Blue Monkey is worth a peek in case you are really bored or if you really want to see every 80s horror movie ever made.

Bearded Warren Beatty plays a turnofthecentury entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; once the profits start coming in, Beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action. Altman creates a solemn, wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this sorry little town is limitedmost of the story being made up of vignettesand Altmans pacing is deliberately slow.

Into a soggy, muddy mining camp John McCabe a hirsute Warren Beatty comes barging, full of cigar smoke and big ideas about building a proper saloonwhorehouse for the town, replete with a trio of the sorriest whores in movie history. He also comes with an unearned reputation as a gunslinger too shameful about this to blatantly advertise it, but not exactly afraid to use it in order to assert alphamale credentials amongst the locals. And thus he wrangles the boys into building his saloon at the rate of 15 cents an hour.It looks to be a rather sorry operation until Mrs. Miller Julie Christie shows up on a startling contraption that is halfrailroad car, halfautomobile where did Altman find that thing?. Mrs. Miller immediately takes on McCabe as a business partner, with the aim of classing up the new joint with proper whores and an insistence that all visitors take a bath before entering. Noting that McCabe does not know how to add, she also insists on handling the accounts. It is not clear what McCabes function will be.The plot thickens when a pair of oily representatives from the mining company show up in town and offer McCabe to buy him out for five grand. McCabe tells them to buzz off  he is holding out for fifteen thousand. The company finds negotiation distasteful, so they hire a trio of assassins to simply kill McCabe . . . though how they think they can get away with murdering a man in broad daylight in the center of town is as unclear as McCabes function in the whorehouse partnership. Excusing this whopping plot hole on the grounds that the locals would be too cowed to talk does not cut the mustard when one considers that any rewardmoney offered by the local Marshal would be pretty tempting. McCabe and Mrs. Miller, purportedly classic Seventies cinema, should be a lot better than it is. The movie tells a pretty good story; the main characters have the potential to be interesting. There are some striking scenes, especially one involving what looks to be a 14yearold stonecold killer. But it is really, really hard to enjoy a movie when you can hardly hear what anyone is saying and when you can hardly see what anyone is doing. Once again, this director hijacks his own movie with sheer barnyard laziness and sloppiness. According to the triviasheet here on IMDb, the movies editor griped to Altman that the sound was muddy; Altman disagreed; and when everyone said the sound was muddy after the movies release, Altman blamed the editor. Nice. Along with the bad sound, the movie has an atrocious look. Only Robert Altman can hire a worldclass DP like Vilmos Zsigmond and make a movie that looks as if they sprayed the camera lenses with dirty dishwater. Reviewers here who praise the dark brown glow of this picture have GOT to be kidding me. The interiors are shot through what appears to be a dark scum. The exterior photography is even worse it is as if Altman placed 500 fog machines behind the copious trees. During the climactic stretch, when Beatty is dodging the assassins while the local church is on fire, Altman insists on pretty much wholly obscuring the view with an animated snowfall that reminds one of a RankinBass Christmas special.Look  I cannot watch a movie under these conditions.

This movie is absolutely terrible. I discovered, after reading some of the other reviews, that a couple of people actually enjoyed this film, which deeply puzzles me, because I do not see how anyone in their right mind could possibly enjoy a movie as awful as Revolution. It is not just that it is a bad movie, with a lame plot and overall strangeness that is extremely unpleasant, but it seems as if the filmmakers were either mentally retarded which is a very possible explanation as to why this movie sucks like it does, though it probably still sucks even compared to other films made by retards or deliberately made every illogical decision to make this movie suck as much as possible. For example, we see Donald Sutherland running around with a huge, fat ugly mole on his face. He does not normally have a mole. The mole does not add to his character. It is extremely ugly and distracting. It is not like Robert De Niros mole; it is much worse. Why the hell has he got that mole? It is as if the filmmakers just said, Let us see, how could we make this movie even worse than it already is? I know, let us give Mr. Sutherland a giant, uglyass mole right on his face.Another example of the filmmakers stupidity is the character Ned. We see, for the first threequarters of the movie, young Ned. At one point, six months later appears on the screen. We see Ned again, and it is, of course, the same actor playing the boy. Five minutes later, three weeks later appears on the screen, and all of a sudden we have got a different actor playing as the now older Ned. What, do they think we are idiots? Good God! Again, it is like the filmmakers are saying, How can we possibly make it any worse? I do not think we can...Oh wait! I just had a terrible idea! I know a kid does not grow much in half a year, which is fine, but he at least grows more than he does in three weeks. Just do not get another actor to play Ned, or at least get him to play the five minutes when he is three weeks younger. Furthermore, the kid who plays the older Ned does not look any older than young Ned. As a matter of fact, he just looks completely different, much skinnier, and no taller or older than the original actor, which is very confusing, as I, like any rational human being, thought at first that it was a new and different character.What, did the first kid die while they were filming the movie? Because he was in it for the first hour and a half, and then all of a sudden, three weeks later, the guy from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is playing Ned for the last five minutes of the movie. And even if the original actor did die, the filmmakers should have at least gotten an actor who looks like him to play the remainder of his role, and reshoot the measly five minutes of six months later scenes. Better yet, just scrap the movie completely, never finish it and never release, never even tell anybody about it, because by that point they should have realized that their movie sucks and in finishing it they would only waste more money and time and succeed in making one of the worst movies of all time.I am not saying that this movie is so bad you should not watch it; it is so bad that you SHOULD watch it, just to see how badly it sucks.

Much of the blame should be attributed to director Hugh Hudson yes, the man who made Chariots Of Fire just a couple of years earlier \u0096 talk about a comedown!!. One of the many jobs of a director is to marshal the actors, coaxing believable performances from them, but in this case Hudson has allowed Pacino to run amok without asking for restraint of any kind. It is not just Als careerlow performance that hinders the film though there are numerous other flaws with Revolution, more of which will be said later.Illiterate trapper Tom Dobb Al Pacino lives in the northeastern region of America with his son Ned Sid OwenDexter Fletcher. He leads a simple life \u0096 living off the land, raising his son, surviving against the elements. The country is lorded over by the English colonialists, but during an eight year period 177583 a revolution takes place which ends with the British being defeated and the independent American nation being born. Dobb gets caught up in the events when his boat and his son are conscripted by the Continental Army \u0096 swept away by events they can barely understand, the Dobbs finds themselves fighting for their lives and freedom in one bloody engagement after another. Tom also falls in love with Daisy McConnahay Natassja Kinski, a beautiful and fiery woman of British aristocratic ancestry. Their forbidden love is played out against the larger historical context of the fighting.Where to start with the films flaws? Most key actors are miscast \u0096 Pacino has been criticised enough already, but Kinski fares little better as the renegade aristocrat while Donald Sutherland is hopelessly lost as a ruthless English soldier with a wobbly Yorkshire accent. Robert Dillons script is muddled in its attempts to bring massive historical events down to a personal level. At no point does anyone seem to have decided whether this is meant to be an intimate character study with the American Revolution as a backdrop, or an epic war film with a handful of sharply drawn characters used to carry the story along. As a result, the narrative falls into no mans land, flitting from grand spectacle to small story indiscriminately and meaninglessly. John Coriglianos score is quite ghastly, and is poured over the proceedings with neither thought nor subtlety. Hugh Hudsons direction is clumsy throughout, both in his mismanagement of Pacino and the other key actors, and in the decision to use irritatingly shaky camera work during the action sequences. The idea of the handheld camera is to create immediacy \u0096 that feeling of being there in the confusion of battle and musket fire. Like so many other things in the film, it does not work. The one department where the film regains a modicum of respectability is the period detail, with costumes, sets and weaponry that look consistently accurate. But if it is period detail you are interested in a trip to the museum would be a better way to spend your time, because as a rousing cinematic experience Revolution does not even begin to make the grade.

Here is a news flash Want to get prisoners to talk? Force them to watch this over and over...they will confess to anything.I will not rehash the plot since there is no coherent plot, but it does take place during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to get involved, but ultimately does. While he has no money, no education and dresses like a caveman, a very hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason, since they have only two minutes of dialogue together.Quite frankly, if Al Smith starred in this movie, instead of Al Pacino, it would have ruined their career. The script was horrible, but Pacinos demotivated performance and obvious fake accent made it even worse. Donald Sutherlands role was laughable. I really cannot describe it.

Then the story started and it all went downhill fast.Motivations were muddled, dialogue was atrocious, events had no historical or political context. What there was of a plot lurched forward on absurd coincidence; by the second or third time that alleged lovers Pacino and Kinski stumbled into each other it had become a bad joke.

Those who stayed tried to stifle giggles, then openly guffawed. I stuck it out  I figured that at least the battle scenes might be good. I was wrong.

Is not that what they call Dawn of the Dead MMIV 2004? A clever word indeed  it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate, remake that is, and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination. Well, damn, was I misled. At least I was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of reimagining, though it played a role.Still, why make a remake? Directors do it for only a few reasons really to update a movie for a modern audience, or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it. An homage, if you will. Nonetheless, it all generally I do admit exceptions boils down to one thing stealing someones idea and reshaping it or reimagining it so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it. It is like ColesCliffs notes; dump everything in a blender, purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors. In other words, a great marketing scheme.So what is wrong with this one? Well, I will start with what I liked. I liked the opening scenes. Thanks to CGI and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust Romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means. We see the city in ruins, thousands of zombies chaos and death. Two words that look beautiful on screen. Then it all falls apart.This setup leads nowhere. The movie does what almost every remake does. It adds more of everything except character, atmosphere, and story. It is noisier, in some sense bloodier, and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots. The setting, the mall which played a crucial role in the original films story and theme, is purely coincidental. The idea communicated in Romeros film, the pure ecstatic joy of having a mall all to yourself as a fortress, is gone here. Further, this reimagining has no moxie, no spirit, no balls. It assumes probably quite rightly that the audience has no attention span and does not bother to get us interested in the characters or the story. The film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original. You actually grew to care about those people in Romeros version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall. Here, you do not care when or who goes what matters is how they go.What else is their to say? The film is not scary. It has one or two jump scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects. As a story it is really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it. The humor is also reduced to a few oneliners and one really good character Andy. After that, what remains? An ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued, inevitable ambiguity of the original film.

Strange Cargo proves to be no exception. Although utilizing the talents of a superb cast, and produced on a top budget, with suitably moody photography by Robert Planck, the movie fails dismally on the credibility score. Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upsets the viewers involvement in the action and with the fate of the characters. I found it difficult to sit still through all the contrived metaphors, parallels and biblical references, and impossible to accept bathedinlight Ian Hunters smug knowitall as a Christ figure. And the censors in Boston, Detroit and Providence at least agreed with me. The movie was banned. Few BostonDetroitProvidence moviegoers, if any, complained or journeyed to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that Gable and Crawford had somehow become involved in a message picture. It flopped everywhere.Oddly enough, the movie has enjoyed something of a revival on TV. A home atmosphere appears to make the movies allegory more receptive to viewers. However, despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film, the plot of this Strange Cargo flows along predictable, heavily moralistic lines that will have noone guessing how the principal characters will eventually come to terms with destiny.","label":0},{"index":9163,"txt":"This film is pure Hollywood hokum. It is based upon a novel called Not Too Narrow \u0085 Not Too Deep by Richard Sale, which may or may not have been interesting; it would take research to find out! The story in the film takes for granted many incidents and much background which obviously existed in the novel but are nowhere to be seen in the film, so either the film was savagely cut or the screenplay was a mess from the start. There is not one millisecond in this film which is remotely realistic, either in terms of events or characters. It is pure Hollywood fantasy in every respect. Two wellknown actors, Paul Lukas and Peter Lorre, are so underused and wasted that there was no point in their being in the film at all. They must have been thrown into the mix in the manner in which one adds a sprinkling of chopped chives to an omelette, hoping that the flavour will be enhanced. The film is a ponderous attempt at producing a morality tale, and is so corny that it is laughable. The story concerns some hardened criminals imprisoned in French Guiana who want to escape from their French colonial prison through a jungle very much a Hollywood set jungle, with a rubber snake. Naturally there has to be a woman in the story, so Joan Crawford hams it up as a downonherluck tramp who for some reason becomes irresistible to Clark Gable, one of the escaped criminals. Crawford in escaping through the jungle wears highheeled shoes and keeps her makeup fresh. Gable flirts and grimaces and makes mawkish expressions, crinkling his brow as was his wont, smirking and looking suggestively at everybody, which was his manner of acting. It is hard to treat such a character as a hardened criminal when he is always trying so hard to be Clark Gable that surely he has not any time left to be a thief. Attentionseekers are by definition too busy to steal and unsuited to a task which requires that people NOT see them. The whole escapade is so ridiculous that it can only be regarded as light entertainment. An attempt at religiosity and depth is made by injecting into the story a mysterious angel of mercy who voluntarily walks into the prison and pretends to be an inmate. He helps in the escape and accompanies all the criminals and ministers to their various deaths, helping them to find peace in their last gasps. This character is played very well by Ian Hunter, who retains throughout a convincing air of secret knowledge, smiles enigmatically, makes cryptic prophetic remarks, and has a small spot trained on his face to give him a heavenly glow. The theme is meant to be redemption. You might call it the Donald Duck version of Hollywood Goes Moral and Gets Heavy. For real depth, Hitchcocks I Confess of 1953 shows how it should really be done. By contrast, this piece of trivial nonsense shows just how bare the cupboards of Meaning were in Tinsel Town, and that when they went rummaging for something that might mean something, all they could come up with was, you guessed it, more tinsel.","label":0},{"index":9164,"txt":"Probably one of the most boriest slasher movies ever, badly acted and badly written.THE PLOT Five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a dorm, but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one, the main suspect is the creepy groundskeeper John Hemmitt played by Woody Roll, or could it be one of the five characters.ACTING Not that bad not that great either apart from Daphne Zungia who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine, and the rest well quite dull although Laura Lapinski the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the end.THE KILLS Cannot really see why they banned this, the kills look fake mostly, one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake, but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car, one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alive.OVERALL Not really a great slasher could have been a lot better","label":0},{"index":9165,"txt":"I thought this was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a famous Australian story.

And he has failed in it very badly. I guess he was trying to make a stylish movie. Any way I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort.

Strange Cargo is no exception. This odd hybrid of adventure film, love story and religious parable trivializes the very insights it tries to communicate. That a figure of providence and salvation would work to match Verne Clark Gable at his most cockily mannered and selfregarding and Julie Joan Crawford, snarling and spitting out every other word in an attempt to be the Queen of Tough Dames seems ludicrous at best.

Somerset Maugham 18741965 was considered among the worlds great authors during his lifetime, and although his reputation has faded over the years his work continues to command critical respect and a large reading public. Published in 1944, THE RAZORS EDGE is the tale of a World War I veteran whose search for spiritual enlightenment flies in the face of shallow western values. It was Maughams last major noveland it was immensely popular. Given that the novels conflicts are internalized spiritual and philosophical issues, it was also an extremely odd choice for a film versionbut Darryl F. Zannuck of 20th Century Fox fell in love with the book and snapped up the screen rights shortly after publication.According to film lore, THE RAZORS EDGE was to be directed by the legendary George Cukor from a screenplay by Maugham himselfand it does seem that Maugham wrote an adaptation. When the film went into production, however, Cukor was replaced by Edmund Goulding, a director less known for artistic touch than a workmanlike manner, and the Maugham script was replaced with one by Lamar Trotti, the author of such memorable screenplays as THE OXBOW INCIDENT. Tyrone Power, recently returned from military service during World War II, was cast as the spiritually conflicted Larry Darrell; Gene Tierney, one of the great beauties of her era, was cast as socialite Isabell Bradley. The supporting cast was particularly notable, including Herbert Marshall, Anne Baxter, Clifton Webb, Lucille Watson, and Elsa Lanchester. Both budget and shooting schedule were lavish, and when the film debuted in 1946 it was greatly admired by public and critics alike.But time has a way of putting things into perspective. Seen today, THE RAZORS EDGE is indeed a beautifully produced filmbut that aside the absolute best one can say for it is that it achieves a fairly consistent mediocrity. As in most cases, the major problem is the script. Although it is reasonably close to Maughams novel in terms of plot, it is noticeably off the mark in terms of character and it completely fails to capture the fundamental issues that drive the story. We are told that Larry is in search of enlightenment; we are told that he receives it; we are told he acts on itbut in spite of the occasional and largely superficial comment we are never really told anything about the spiritual, artistic, philosophical, and intellectual processes behind any of it. We are most particularly never told anything significant about the nature of the enlightenment itself. It has the effect of cutting off the story at its knees.We are left with the shell of Maughams plot, which centers on the relationship between Larry and Isabell, a woman Larry loves but leaves due to the growing ideological riff that opens up between them. Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney were more noted for physical beauty than talent, but both could turn in good performances when they received solid directorial and script support. Unfortunately, that does not happen here; they are extremely onenote and Power is greatly miscast to boot. Fortunately, the supporting cast is quite good, with Herbert Marshall, Clifton Webb, and Lucille Watson particularly so; the thenfamous performance by Anne Baxter, however, has not worn as well as one would hope.With a running time of just under two and a half hours, the film also feels unnecessarily long. There is seemingly endless cocktail partytype banter, and indeed the entire India sequence which reads as faintly hilarious would have been better cut entirelyan odd situation, for this is the very sequence intended as the crux of the entire film. Regardless of the specific scene, it all just seems to go on and on to no actual point.As for the DVD itself, the film has not been remastered, but the print is extremely good, and while the bonus package is not particularly memorable neither is noticeably poor. When all is said and done, I give THE RAZORS EDGE four stars for production values and everyones willingness to take on the materialbut frankly, this a film best left Power and Tierney fans, who will enjoy it for the sake of the stars, and those whose ideas about spiritual enlightenment are as vague as the film itself.GFT, Amazon Reviewer","label":0},{"index":9172,"txt":"What if Somerset Maugham had written a novel about a coal miner who decided to search for transcendental enlightenment by trying to join a country club? If he had, he could have called it The Razors Edge, since the KathaUpanishad tells us, The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over; thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard. But Maugham decided to stick with the wellbred class, and so we have Darryl F. Zanucks version of Larry Darrell, recently returned from WWI, carefully groomed, well connected in society and determined to find himself by becoming a coal miner. Or, as Maugham tells us, This is the young man of whom I write. He is not famous. It may be that when at last his life comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on this earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Yet it may be that the way of life he has chosen for himself may have an ever growing influence over his fellow men, so that, long after his death, perhaps, it will be realized that lived in this age a very remarkable creature. The Razors Edge has all of Zanucks cultural taste that money could buy. It is so earnest, so sincere...so selfimportant. As Larry goes about his search for wisdom, working in mines, on merchant ships, climbing a Himalayan mountain to learn from an ancient wise man, we have his selfish girl friend, Isabel, played by Gene Tierney, his tragic childhood chum played by Anne Baxter, the girlfriends snobbish and impeccably clad uncle played by Clifton Webb, and Willie Maugham himself, played by Herbert Marshall, taking notes. The movie is so insufferably smug about goodness that the only thing that perks it up a bit is Clifton Webb as Elliot Templeton. If I live to be a hundred I shall never understand how any young man can come to Paris without evening clothes. Webb has some good lines, but we wind up appreciating Clifton Webb, not Elliot Templeton. Zanuck wanted a prestige hit for Twentieth Century when he bought the rights to Maughams novel. He waited a year until Tyrone Power was released from military service. He made sure there were welldressed extras by the dozens, a score that sounds as if it were meant for a cathedral and he even wrote some of the scenes himself. The effort is as selfconscious as a fat man wearing a rented tux. Despite Hollywoods view of things in The Razors Edge, I can tell you that for most people hard work does not bring enlightenment, just weariness and low pay. After nearly twoandahalf hours, we last see Larry carrying his duffle bag on board a tramp steamer in a gale. He is going to work his way back to America from Europe with a contented smile on his face. My dear, Somerset Maugham says to Isabel at the same time in an elaborately decorated parlor, Larry has found what we all want and what very few of us ever get. I do not think anyone can fail to be better, and nobler, kinder for knowing him. You see, my dear, goodness is after all the greatest force in the world...and he is got it! Larry and the audience both need a healthy dose of Dramamine. Maugham, lest we forget, was a fine writer of plays, novels, essays and short stories. To see how the movies could do him justice, watch the way some of his short stories were brought to the screen in Encore, Trio and Quartet. And instead of wasting time with Larry Darrell, spend some time with Lawrence Durrell. The Alexandria Quartet is a good read.","label":0},{"index":9173,"txt":"Mark Hamill should have felt mighty embarrassed with CORVETTE SUMMER!

An exclusive club, it was the perfect symbol of 70s cultural overindulgence and selfabsorption; there is even an excellent VH1 documentary about the club that could tell you everything you wanted to know about its heyday, and the stories are easily interesting enough to spawn a very captivating film.Sadly, this is not it. 54 follows the lives of a few of its employees, a bartender named Shane Ryan Phillippe, a busboy named Greg Breckin Meyer, his wife, a coatcheck girl, Anita Selma Hayek, and of course the master of ceremonies himself, Steve Rubell Mike Meyers. While the goingson at the club are well represented, this film concerns itself more with the personal lives of the workers, following Shanes story the closest.The movie works in spurts. Sometimes it captures perfectly the shallowness of the nightlife culture such as when Shane is taken to a dinner party and does not know who Errol Flynt is, and other times it waxes into hokey melodrama. Some of that is inherent in the premise \u0096 following the underlings as they mingle in the world of the rich and fabulous \u0096 but a lot of it is due to the kidgloved treatment with which both the club and Rubell are given throughout the movie. While Rubell certainly electrified the scene in New York with his penchant for overthetop spectacle and his exclusive handpicking of the crowds each night, the rampant drugs and sexuality are only briefly touched on; and Rubell himself, while his excesses are mentioned, come off oddly positive for a guy who was in life a liar, a cheat, a drug abuser, and promiscuous as all hell. Not that I was looking for the man to be pilloried here, but his ego directly contributed to the fall of his club and the diminishing of the nightlife culture he helped to elevate. A final scene where he gazes down at the regulars paternally is so emotionally false as to be patently absurd.Meyers does his best to capture Rubell, but he is given so little to work with here it is surprising his performance is effective; but he is good, and he helps to anchor the film. Philippe, whom I find generally to be a good actor, is hamstrung here by the shallowness and stupidity of his character; he is limited to a deerintheheadlights smile or a sullen uncomprehending frown, and even he cannot translate that into a strong performance. Hayek and Meyer are both okay, again, undercut by the writing, and Neve Campbell \u0096 prominently featured on the DVD cover \u0096 appears so briefly she really has an extended cameo.For some reason I still find myself interested, even fascinated, by the popular culture of the second half of the seventies. But even given that, this is not a film that particularly engaged me, despite a predisposition to like it. I would say if that era, or that club, has any interest for you, track down the VH1 special rather than this middleoftheroad melodrama.","label":0},{"index":9186,"txt":"Totally forgettable. Specially because of the weak acting. This is the first movie I have seen with Dax Shepard. To my surprise, he is been around since the late 90s. I thought he was a newcomer, since his acting was so bland. I could say the same about Liv Tyler. Although I have seen her do well in other movies, she gave Clare Cooper a strange personality. Liv is not the kind of actress that will give the character a fiery, emotional personality like Diane Keaton would be able to, but it was pretty strange to see her say her lines in whisper mode. It seemed that altogether there simply was not a very good chemistry going on between the actors, and I think Diane Keaton sensed that as well.

To make the work a bit more difficult, a murderous, Chuckswearing psycho is wandering the halls of the dorm, preying on the group in various violent ways.Registered as one of the 74 video nasties listed by the U.K. in the 1980s, The Dorm That Dripped Blood had a good reputation built up for it prior to first viewing.

So, after hearing all of that info, I settled into Pranks alt. title expecting a sleazy slasher experience. . . and that is what it tried to be, but failed pretty much completely. Visually, the films not great. The cinematography, gore except for a couple scenes, and overall direction all fail. It is simply not enjoyable to watch. The unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason like the opening kill. There are some cool death scenes, including a pretty nice face melt which can be seen on the poster, but that is about it for the positive. The acting is pretty bad, the story seems unimportant, the killer is not cool or scary, and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid it is a bit boring. Overall, for a film done by a few UCLA film students for 90,000 which would be over double that today, The Dorm That Dripped Blood is not a total mess. It has a couple good things, and is fairly watchable. . . But, as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like The House on Sorority Row and Pieces. . . it just cannot compare. Do not expect much, and you may at least be entertained.

Although it is not as satisfying as a classic piece in that genre, there are compensations. The tensions generated between Huppert and Balibar as women calmly but calculatingly at war over a boy they both claim are compelling; however, in a true European arthouse style, Ruiz does not give us release of this tension as the women alternately also try to behave compassionately towards each other. The only raised voice is that of Hupperts waking from a nightmare an uncontested irrational event in the film.In fact, if we follow the title, the film is as little about its thriller skeleton as Jane Campions In The Cut. Instead it is an intergender psychological study focusing on men. The boy, Camille Nils Hugon, decides on a practical joke, playing his mother off against an emotionally vulnerable other woman. Both women seem to pander to him rather than scold and this compounds the problem. In the background is an intemperate psychologist Charles Berling, swift to confront the women in his life  his sister Huppert, the nanny or his pa  and so acting as a symbolic adult counterbalance to the, calm and we learn manipulative Camille. It is particularly interesting that, like the father in Henry James The Turn of The Screw, Denis Podalydes lawenforcer Father is absent for the duration of the film. Ruiz fashions an Oedipal moment out of Hupperts reaction to his return at the films close.Read either as a thriller or as a psychiatric essay, this film is ultimately rather disappointing. I am officially rather fed up with Mme Hupperts screen method, which is too buried and so I will be looking to see her on stage before I come back to her European  enjoyed Heavens Gate films again. The support is good. Ruiz does the cast no favours though. Quite apart from some poor lighting and some wilfully odd shots, its as if his direction has left characterisation quite out of reach  I am thinking particularly of Edith Scobs Shamanic neighbour to Isabelle, who acts knowing but communicates bafflement.

On the bright side, Gaston Leroux does not has to turn over in his grave just yet. It could have been a lot worse.

No wonder Jose Larraz disowned it at one point and refuses to discuss it. I admire Larrazs work, especially his more obscure slashersex maniac thrillers like SAVAGE LUST or SCREAM AND DIE. His work has a kind of inescapable artiness about it that he cannot seem to switch off, owing in part to his secondary career as a painter  cartoonist. It is too bad he never made a Western, his vision would have been perfect.BLACK CANDLES is easily his most notorious film and probably his best known after the masterpiece VAMPYRES. And it is notoriety revolves around one scene where a Satanic coven enacts a bizarre rite involving extracting the reproductive fluid of a goat  symbolizing The Beast  as some kind of nauseating balm to be used in preparing the waif like sister of a murdered man for her role as the bride of Satan. The scene in question is staged in a way that looks rather convincing even without the display of any plumbing apparatus the goat may have been endowed with, relying upon the histrionics of the actress recruited to play the supplicant in the ritual and lots of guttural chanting on the films recycled musical score heard in a halfdozen films attributed to Jacinto Molina. The perverse nature of the scene is more implied than shown in graphic detail, heightened somewhat by the knowledge that said supplicant is actually the teenaged daughter of the Satanic priest. My but they had fun concocting this movie.The problem with it is that there is not much to deconstruct or contemplate aside from the paper thin ROSEMARYS BABY derived story of a woman being weaned into her role as Satans bride by a sophisticated coven of Satanists living in the hedgrowed outlands of a very sinister Britain. Led by Eurohorror sensation Helga Line these Satanists are comprised of doctors, lawyers, land owning magnates and other upper crust dignitaries who actually owe their professional success to their worship of the devil. All you have to do is sell your soul and the world can be yours, only watch out whom you may sell out to pay back petty personal conflict or you may end up being felched with a sword.The film attempts to combine this heady Satanic trip with oodles or borderline graphic sex, and should correctly be regarded as a kind of apex or culmination of the sex and horror Spanish thriller traditions popularized in part by Mr. Molina  Ms. Line, and which had amazingly flourished under the disapproving eye of one Generalissimo Franco, the dictator who controlled Spain up until 1976. While he lived his decree was that Spanish cinema was to be free of graphic depictions of onscreen sex. Spanish directors often made two versions of their films, one with the sex concealed for their own screens and one with the fornication on display for export. As difficult as it was for the filmmakers to express themselves the result was a sort of interesting tension that usually results when artists flirt with the forbidden Spanish horror from the 1970s has a very special flavor to it that is somewhat of an acquired taste. It is not for everyone.But in a bizarre turn of events, without Francos influence on their culture Spanish horror sort of dried up in the late 1970s, when their Gothic castles and demonic orgies suddenly found themselves pass\u00e9 when compared to new sensations like JAWS and the STAR WARS phenomenon. And without Francos constraints their were suddenly a flood of overtly graphic thrillers that came tumbling out of the pipes in the very late 70searly 80s, of which BLACK CANDLES is perhaps the best known due to it is emphasis on sexual deviancy with a barnyard animal. Larraz major horror films have always revolved around sexual taboos the lesbianism of VAMPYRES, the incest of SCREAM AND DIE  DEVIATION but here the effect of the depravity is to overshadow the rest of the production. Nobody cares about anything else but the traditionally censored trip to the Goat Barn, and watching a cut version without the scene in the barn is almost an exercise in pointlessness. The sex is not graphic enough to rate as porn and the chills are not chilling enough to rate as horror.So, BLACK CANDLES is essentially a behavior study  Here is how high society British Satanists might behave in their secluded mansions out in the West Midlands or whatever. Between sex scenes the actorsactresses sit around and have lots of discussions. The best thing the film has going for it is an undeniably oppressive atmosphere of claustrophobia, with most of it is action taking place in the tightly confined interiors of Ms. Lines characters mansion. Nearly every avenue of fornication is hinted at so fans of softcore sex romps with a hinting of supernatural horror will be amused, and of course the vicarious sex criminals amongst us will enjoy choking their chickens to the goat barn scene. But the ultimate conclusion of the film is silly, pretentious, intelligence insulting, and probably perfect for such an otherwise forgettable exercise in applied sleaze.210; Without the Goat Barn this movie just is not the same, and with the scene it is probably a bit too much for most viewers.

For viewers who love surfing this film will be a gigantic disappointment since the total number of minutes of surfing footage struggles to reach three.The story is a slice of life about beached surfers who are waiting not for the perfect wave, but for any wave at all. J.C. Sean Pertwee is an aging super surfer who is flirting with a commitment with his girlfriend Chloe Catherine Zeta Jones. Just as he is about to find grown up bliss with the woman he loves, three old surfing friends turn up and convince him to hit the beach looking for monster waves at the Bone Yard. The trouble is, there are no waves until the very end of the film, so most of the story dissipates itself on a meandering succession of disconnected beach happenings.The acting is mostly mediocre. Sean Pertwee has a few comical moments, but mostly his acting was mundane. Ewan McGregor was decent as the drug dealing wild man, by far the most interesting and peculiar character of the bunch. Probably the funniest performance was turned in by Peter Gunn as Terry who turned his corpulent body into a continual sight gag.

Such is the case with Blue Juice, a 1995 Brit flick about an unlikely group of surfing enthusiasts in what would seem to a dumb American, anyway an even more unlikely place to find surfers Cornwall, England. You might be thinking this has the makings for an amusing, quirky little comedy. If only. The film is just a bit over ninety minutes but it seems interminable. The easiest way to describe it is as a sort of 90s British version of Grease without the dancing, but even that makes it sound better than it is. No, the best way to take it is as a little sliceoflife set in a small town. Catherine ZetaJones plays Chloe, a young woman living with a surfing instructor, JC Sean Pertwee; you remember him. Pertwee is actually the films star, and his character is something of a surfing legend to a small group of surfing devotees, the requisite oddball group of free spirits that inevitably inhabit films like this. In this case, it consists of a drug dealer who wants to be a journalist, a former nightclub dj who wants to be a record producer, and a fat nerdy guy who, in a needlessly extended scene, gets stoned and loses all his inhibitions which of course turns out to be the best thing that ever happened to him. I cannot honestly say everything that goes on in Blue Juice is predictable, since it is set in a place and reflects customs and manners I am not very familiar with, but there is certainly nothing surprising or even interesting that takes place there or with the characters. The comedy, though, IS very predictable and tired. One can sense the setups a mile away and almost recite the dialogue in American form, of course before the actors do. The relationship between JC and Chloe is every bit as hackneyed. She wants him to grow up; he wants them to stay the impetuous teenagers they started out being. He is afraid of losing face with his gang; she thinks he prefers them to her. You get the idea. As I struggled to stay focused on Blue Juice, toward the end I felt, as the saying goes, that this was an hour and half of my life I would never get back.","label":0},{"index":9223,"txt":"A movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself, Blue Juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and Cornwall.

The beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes. Plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional.

It is like the students drawing that was torn up by one of the teachers, all the footage for this film was cut up in a freak accident involving a meatgrinder, and left half the stock destroyed, with the other half spliced into twosecond bits. Even in a tensecond scene of the local TV news, there are about six cuts and three different angles. And then there are the montages.

Okay, now with the films major flaw, and it was not the story, or lack thereof. The director made that fatal mistake of leading you astray about people and situations, not by clever storytelling, but by being highly selective about what to show about the main characters. That is just cheating. I guess he did it in order to make the central character more likable. But it just became plain annoying.

Basically, the main villain of the peace turns out be an okay guy, if a coward. Plus it turns what seemed to be the whole point of the movie, that you should stand up for a just cause on its head, by the already mentioned misdirection, and makes it into a point about the nature of revolutions, that was already made, and much better, by animal farm.

There is an awful lot of style over very little substance unfortunately the style has not dated too well in the eight years since its release. As for the substance, the film tries to pose an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of schoollife; but beneath the shiny veneer, a remotely meaningful or relevant argument fails to materialise. Characters are painted in childishly broad strokes, falling into the kind of generic stereotypes the writers father sought to question in Breakfast Club.

In the waiting area they find two other people, Ronnie Jim Wolf  a sleeping woman named Lindsay Marjorie Fitzsimmons who is currently having a terrifying nightmare...While swimming in an indoor pool Lindsay encounters  befriends guy named Billy Waters Jesse Johnson, the next time Lindsay sees Billy he dives into the pool  then seemingly disappears into thin air before he surfaces. Shortly after Lindsay discovers that Billy Water died in a diving accident 5 years ago...Lindsay wakes up  tells the others about her nightmare, everyone else responds by saying that they too have suffered disturbing dreams recently  decide to share them to pass the time...Next up is Mason who tells a story of how he  two friends, Scott David R.

The script by Boyd lacks what is needed for films such as Chillers to work, you can see the final twist coming a mile off  each story is really lame. The first one is totally pointless  did not seem to have an ending  the best thing about these anthologies are the short snappy stories that are rounded off with a neat twist. The second story is predictable , again, just ends without any payoff. So it continues throughout Chillers that each story is deeply unsatisfying to watch  have no reward for doing so. The characters  dialogue are poorly written, the stories seem to have no original ideas of their own  as a whole the film totally sucks. At least each story does not last long  I liked the idea behind the linking segments.Director Boyd was obviously working with a very low budget  it shows. All I can say is if you want to watch a 15 odd minute short story set entirely within a swimming pool then Chillers is for you. The stories are neither clever, scary or have any sort of tension or build up to anything. Having said that it does have a few nice scenes  some surprising competence shines through on occasion. Violence  gore wise there is not much happening in Chillers, a ripped out heart, a decapitated head  a bitten off hand is as gory as it gets.Technically Chillers is poor stuff that will not impress anyone. Basic cinematography, bad music, cheap special effects  below average production values. Chillers also features one of the worst closing theme songs ever, period. The acting is also of a very low standard.I am sure a lot of effort was put into Chillers as a low budget film  at least the filmmakers tried so I will give credit for that at least, but that still does not stop me from thinking it is crap. Similar anthology films like Tales From the Crypt 1972, Asylum 1972, The Vault of Horror 1973, Dr. Terrors House of Horrors 1965, Creepshow 1982  Tales From the Darkside The Movie 1990 are far superior to Chillers so watch one of those instead.","label":0},{"index":9242,"txt":"When the movie was released it was the biggest hit and it soon became the Blockbuster.

In the movie the hero of the movie Ganesh sacrifices his love for the leading lady Pooja Gandhi even though the two loved each other! His justification is the meaning of the tagline.

But, a BAD movie and a low budget AND effects. That makes for a bad combination. In this case, such a doomed combo created the craptastic film, Invisible Mom.

They would have been dated even for the 1980s, and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s have had the same or better SFX work. Certainly noone involved in the production of this film was looking for an Oscar. It is a wild departure from director Fred Olen Rays usual stuff, most of which has the word Bikini in the title Bikini Pirates, Bikini Chain Gang, Bikini Girls from the Lost Planet, etc and are little more than TA flicks, but here we are with a film rated U and aimed squarely at the kiddies. You have got to give him credit for diversifying!! This was a minor directtovideo cult hit which later resulted in a couple of sequels  Invisible Mom 2 and Invisible Dad. Dee WallaceStone whose career went downhill fast after 1982s E.T. plays the invisible mom of the films title and would return for the sequel. Russ Tamblyn whose career had been in freefall even longer since 1961s West Side Story plays the villainous Dr. Woorter. It is probably fair to say that most of the cast were at the point in their careers where they would be prepared to work on almost anything just to pay the bills that month  except maybe young Trenton Knight as Josh. It is rather telling though that although he worked prior to this movie, this child actor did not work again after the sequel, Invisible Mom 2. Maybe the film was cursed. After all, he was not that bad in this film. For a child actor, he is pretty good  no better or worse than any of his more experienced costars.As mentioned above, the invisibility effects are naff to say the least, the direction is poor, the writing obvious and the acting nothing to write home about. There are plenty of worse films out there though, and for anyone under the age of about ten, this film will no doubt be quite watchable.

He has a lovely wife, Grace Horn Rosanna Arquette, who is pregnant, and a beautiful son of about five years old. Sammy indeed loves his family, but like Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, he has a double life, having sex with many different women. Dr. Jane Bordeaux Nastassja Kinski is trying to help him. OK, it is my fault I read the summary of the other IMDB user comments, I saw the IMDB user rating, but I really did not believe that Rosanna Arquette and Nastassja Kinski could participate in such a bad movie. I decided to check it, and actually some comments are very complacent. The storyline, the screenplay and the dialogs are so silly and laughable that even in some Xrated movies we can find more intelligent stories. The photography is so amateurish and naive that in some parts it seems to be taken through a VHS camcorder. Michael Des Barres does not have sense of ridiculous being an old man, bald, would be acceptable in an advertisement of Viagra or grandfather of the small boy. But as an attractive man who gets and has sex with any woman, it is scary. In Wood Allens comedy, maybe he got a chance, but in a serious movie, it is funny. I am trying to figure out why or how Rosanna Arquette and Nastassja Kinski accepted to participate in such awful, amateurish and trash movie. Do they need money? Lack of chances in better movies due to their ages? Are they friends of the director sorry for using this word and decided to help and promote him? I do not know whether the intention of Rosanna Arquette was to show her breasts full of silicone, but it is unacceptable that such a great actress accepts such a script. The same is applicable to the gorgeous Nastassja Kinki. She is presented fat, without makeup, without any glamour. A total lack of respect with one of the most beautiful actress in the cinema history. A fact is really intriguing me how can a reader, without any personal interest, promote this trash, giving higher ratings or writing favorable comments about this movie?

Nastassja Kinski was alright in her role as the concerned sex therapist, she could have of done more though and I am not suggesting her having sex.

The writing is so amateurcharacters that have known each other all their life go into big long speeches about their life history for the sake of the audience. Not at all the way people talk to each other. What was the Director Thinking?The directing is equally bad! The forced and overly deliberate style feels amateurish. In one scene, a character is yelling Take your hands off of me and NO ONE is touching him! The most badly directed scene however, is the incredibly overthetop battle scene at the beginning of the film.Excessive Gore in a Very Fake, Silly Battle SceneThere are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene. It looks like a Saturday Night Live skit!! You can see extras waiting for their cues to walk across camera. Everyone plays their death scene like 4th grade boysexaggerating every little gasp and twitch. The blood on battle victims is so excessive and carelessly applied it looks like someone used a ketchup dispenser and just squirted straight lines of red on the costumes.This whole battle scene comes off as the spoof of a really cheesy war movie. You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride up on a horse and deliver the punchline.Who in Real Life Would Ever Behave this Way?! The most ridiculous bit of writing, directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene A little girl is standing under the dead body of her hanging fatherwho is terribly mutilated, and literally dripping blood form his gaping wounds. Even a totally idiot would know he is dead! Yet she isvery monotonouslyrepeating over and over Daddy, daddy... while looking at someone offscreen. She delivered it with about as much believability and passion as you could expect from an nonactor kid that had been repeating the line for the cameras all day.Even if the poor kid had any acting skills, the scene is completely unbelievable. The little girl would not even BE in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnagesurrounded by hundreds of dead bodies, while she calmly stands there!! Natural instincts would had the kid screaming and terrified, running AWAY from the bloody carnage! Are we Suppose to be Horrified or Laugh...?!One particularly goofy detail, that gives the scene an SNL satire tone, is the father hanging, with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek. He looks like a fish on a hook! The unintentionally funny details, make the whole scene come across as fake and silly.In Fantasy LaLaLand, Mothers and Daughters are the Same Age!

I cannot fault her for someone elses poor blocking, but she is totally unbelievable in her role. Her little girl voice works against her here. And I consider myself a Nastassja Kinski fan. She is certainly ageless and exotic, but she is outside her range with this.Alexandra Paul is pathetically overwrought. Every line she delivers is with three exclamation points. Someone must have directed her to scream at all costs. Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew?Finally, Rosanna Arquette as the sweet, maligned wife comes off okay, and probably the most believable of the bunch.

The story revolves around Sammy Horn subtle name played by Michael Des Barres. Sammy is a restaurant owner with a clueless wife Grace Rosanna Arquette and a young child. He has a sexual addiction and must have meaningless sex every five minutes with any woman in his field of vision who will agree and of course every woman on the planet finds him irresistible despite the fact that he looks old enough to be collecting Social Security.The story is centered on a conversation with his therapist Nastassja Kinski where he is describing each of his sexual exploits via flashback. This is nothing more than a convenient launching point for a parade of serial sex acts, which consumes at least 75 of the screen time.It is hard to know where to begin criticizing a film this bad. The production values are abysmal. The movie is shot on video with a look somewhere between a TV soap opera at best and an amateur porn flick shot in someones garage. The direction by Joseph Brutsman is horrible with bad lighting, uninspired framing and poor actor direction. The script is vapid and the dialogue mindless and vulgar.Women are generally portrayed as sex obsessed nymphomaniacs just waiting for an addict like Sammy to come along and rough them up while feeding their insatiable appetites with some impersonal copulation. As an example, Graces sister comes over to indignantly inform Sammy that she knows he is been sleeping around and that she is going to tell his wife. His response to that is to throw her up against the wall and begin raping her. About three seconds into it she has an epiphany and is instantly converted to one of his sex disciples begging him to give her more. Just as they finish Grace walks in and sis says to her, Oh, great to see you, gotta run to pick up Timmy and mums the word about Sammys indiscretions. The bond of loyalty has been sealed with a good ravishment. No spoiler here because it is so typical of the obvious nature of the film that anyone who had seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it.The sex depictions are all overdone, mechanical, and so poorly simulated that they are more comical than erotic. Most of them are done with both participants fully clothed. The acting is wretched. Michael Des Barres presents all the depth of a rain puddle. He really seems to get into the thrusting and profanity of the sex parts, but when it comes to actually acting with Arquette and Kinski, he is adrift. Rosanna Arquette is the closest thing to an actor in this film, giving a bearable performance and looking genuinely hurt when she finally discovers that her perfect husband is a lecherous animal. Nastassja Kinski is far too compassionate as the therapist, but at least we have some acting happening here. The rest of the cast is just a collection of elevated body doubles to whom they give thought provoking lines like hit me harder, is that the best you can do? and Oh, God\u0085YES.This movie is among the worst I have ever seen, a dubious distinction given the thousands of films I have viewed.

Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just awful as the slave owning and keeping couple, although both normally do fine work. The actors and director should not have attempted to do accents at allthey are inconsistent and unbelievable. Much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual English. The casting is ludicrous. Why have children of an African merchant thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society  been cast with very pale skinned actors, while the supposedly socially desirable Marcel, has pronounced African features, including an obviously dyed blond fro? It is as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color. It is just so weird! This could be a great movie and should be remade, but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors.

It truly felt like ten minutes.If suspension of disbelief means almost falling asleep during a movie, then this has plenty of that.

Sad thing is that viewers probably hoped director Alex Nichol was forcibly placed in a coffin, nailed shut, and buried alive for his lame effort. Jenny placed in this unfortunate horrific situation never really draws any sympathy you would feel for a woman whose anxiety is blamed on a haunted, cranial receptacle.

Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the mans first wife who he was devoted to. Maybe it is just that the 1950s did not have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie, the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane.

But there is some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home, and the gardens and pool are a nice touch. For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock John Hudson going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull, he just wades right in clothes and all, in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener director Alex Nicol in a dual role.

And even though Sam Peckinpah had a hand in the screenplay, along with Robert Towne, it still emerges as a leadenly written movie dryly directed by the undistinguished Buzz Kulik. Firstly, top billed Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is wrong for the part! He is not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His one note performance lacks the fire and gusto Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could have brought to the role. Brynner simply looks like a Russian aristocrat dressed up like a Mexican bandit who is in the middle of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian one. Also, second billed Robert Mitchum is totally wasted in the picture! His part as a biplane flying ace lobbing homemade bombs from the air in the cause of the revolution is a poorly written meager role that could have been played by any minor star. Mitch has not a decent line in the entire movie and brings to ones mind his other Mexican revolution picture the far superior Bandido 1956 which unfortunately nobody seems to have any interest in releasing on DVD. Besides lacking any kind of style Villa Rides also suffers badly without the presence of a female star! There is starlet Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl who gives Mitchum the glad eye but her casting is merely perfunctory. Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters could have perhaps added a couple of badly needed notches to the faltering story line.There are a couple of good action scenes in the movie but a couple of good action scenes do not a movie make and the less than perfect Panavision picture quality plus the over repetitive Maurice Jarre theme tune does not help matters.As is Paramounts wont there are no extras  not even a trailer!

Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin have, perhaps, the worst screen chemistry I have seen in a good while, and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street merchants about the only thing they can legitimately qualify for. Furthermore, how Angus Macfadyen got convinced to do this movie is so far beyond me that I cannot even think of an analogy. I am a loyal fan of his, but this has made me question him.To sum it up. Several people want revenge for different reasons and if you care enough to know what they are, you are a bigger person than me, so much so that it turns to violence I guess.

That is why movies like Fast and the Furious, Dhoom, Rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences, especially local ones. We live on a tiny island, and I cannot fathom why, for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system, most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with 100 tax when they reach our shores, and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one. Not only that, the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear, lest they reach the sea.And these movies are relatively easy to make. Hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic. For once, those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long, cannot compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these. Of course there are amongst us ahem those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models, and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame, however, they do not warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen, even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into Park. The guy sitting beside me, I swear he wet his pants every time his dream cars appear, and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans.So there we have it, the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie. With the Fast and the Furious franchise, the Japanese models like the Evos and the Skylines take centerstage, as does the GT. Here, the Ford GT takes on an incredibly droolworthy facade modification, that even I am impressed, alongside the latest models like the Ferrari Enzos, Porshe Carerra GTs, Koenigsegg CCXs, and every car out there that has wings for doors. But seriously, my heart goes out to the cars each time they are mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment. I mean, this are perfectly fine, high performance models that are at the apex of motoring, but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow, they do so because they can,There is no story in Redline, just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties the cars that is that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible, and with the usual shots of pedals always the accelerator, mind you, tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy, and earn you no respect, steering wheels, gear shifts always shifting up and not down, all these while having the actors make pretend that they are the baddest asses with an engine, snarling and giving each other dirty looks. Not a very tall order for an actor, and that is why we get the most woeful performances ever, with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids.The heroine yes, it made a statement that girls can drive Natasha a very plasticky looking Nadia Bjorlin is one of those million dollar finds  a girl with model looks who do not mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil, who has racing pedigree within her, and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable every line had to do with cars, and when singing about love, just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts, lubricants and going for rides. Introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called Infamous Eddie Griffin, she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a Leo DiCaprio lookalike Iraq war veteran, and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle. Everything else, well like I said, just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race.And it is almost always the same, as there is very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars, especially when you know the race is rigged for narrative reasons and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line. While Fast and Furious had quite charismatic actors, and I will put my head on the chopping block by naming Paul Walker, Sun Kang, and of course, the star it created  Vin Diesel, Redline had none, just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately. It looks like a TV movie in its treatment from the get go, with a very insipid opening sequence where it is one man, one car, and a 105 minutes race against time to get to Vegas.If not for the cars, then this movie seriously is a piece of junk, with bad acting, bad lines and bad action.

I mean songs about cars; not exactly what you would here on the radio. Since it is a Hollywood film, you have to give this story a little lee way, but in real life I do not think any average joe would come across such a hot girl as Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a race car, fix a car engine, and be a lead singer.

The movie was like listening to a 19 year old street racer with ADD who decided to buy a car instead of go to college tell a story. Being so poorly scripted, I thought the two brothers in the film were lovers at first. The scenes at the racetrack, along with the main female actor in the film kept making me think of Herbie Fully Loaded. This is the kind of film is what Grindhouse modeled itself after...only the writers thought they were being serious.","label":0},{"index":9328,"txt":"I registered just to make this comment which pretty much echos some of the ones here already The acting is worse than subpar, it expounds on commonly held stereotypes, has some of the worst displays of tasteless female objectification all bod no brain, and has some of the cheesiest lines known to man.including but not limited to allright lets see what these guys can do I should also mention that when they show the crashes involving innocent civilians, you end up feeling bad for the innocent people and start to hate the characters themselves. Eddie Griffins character is also one of the most stereotypical black guy personas that just rubs people the wrong way. He may or may not be a good actor but this movie does not allow for that kind of character exploration. You want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys? Oceans 11. This movie just makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audience.Even the cars cannot make up for this fluke of a movie. That Enzo that Griffin wrecked sums up this movie perfectly.

If not for the exotics, I would not have even rated this movie a 1.

Not only was the storyline nonexistent, but the action was crap too. I guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie. For an example, there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a SLR McLaren to win. And after the bit where Eddy Griffin got in a fight with one of his girls an Imus comment would work in this case the girl asks to pull over and get out of the PLANE and of course they do in the middle of the desert.

Scott Fitzgerald, gossip columnist Sheila Graham wrote this trashy story. Gregory Peck carries on in shameless excess as a forceful bedrunkorbedamned alcoholic; in contradiction to the gentle and soft spoken real Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on Fitzgeralds Hollywood writing era, late in his life, the muchhonored author was, in fact, living a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well known. Fitzgerald was nonetooproud to be recycling his flapper stories in order to support both his wife in a mental hospital and his daughter in college. Living in a small apartment and driving a second hand Chevrolet his life was 180 degrees different than as portrayed in this movie.Virtually every 20th CenturyFox movie made during Daryll F.

Beloved Infidel was the exception.","label":0},{"index":9336,"txt":"There is a scene in this film at about the 42 minute mark that is among the worst I have seen in some time. As F.

This dramatic scene becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic I could not help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all was...as dramatic music swelled on the television as it all came to a phony crescendo. NO ONE experiences moments like thisno one. Now how much of the rest of the film is true, I cannot say, but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an 8 Rolexand leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correctthe film is a lot of bunk. However, I am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet did not seem to clear this up, either. Just who were F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sheilah Graham and what was their relationship really like? What I do know about Fitzgerald, however, does seem different from what I saw in the film. Was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film? Well, considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with Graham and drank like a fish, I would assume he was not. Was he as obnoxious and boorish as we later see in the film? Perhaps, but if he was this bad AND yet Ms. Graham stayed with him, then this makes her out to be a complete dummyand not someone you would like to see featured in a film. And, if he was not, then the film does a poor disservice to his memory. Either way, it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experience.The sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people. In a dark and salacious way, some might find this all very entertaining, but most are sure to see this as a train wreck with no surprises along the way! Unpleasant but with glossy production values especially the music, which was lovely but way over the top it begs the question why did they even choose to make this in the first place?.

Based on Shielah Grahams autobiography, it seems like the powers that be could not leave well enough alone. They could not decide if this was to be Grahams story or Fitzgeralds story, and also how much they should softpedal whoevers story it turned out to be. So a film that could have been a story about two fascinating Fitzgerald and notorious Ms. Grahampersonalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either. Added to this there is absolutely no period feel other than for 1959. Clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing. However  and this saved the film for me  Kerr has never looked lovelier, and Peck is as always a very handsome man. They truly make a beautiful, mature couple, and I only wish they had better material to work with. There is one scene that does work  Scott goes after Shielah while in a drunken state, and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs.

This is all taken very seriously until near the end when some lame oneliners and attempts at litening up the mood do not work at all. The performances are not the problem here, but the story is.

Nazis, occult , government conspiracies. I was expecting a low budget Nazi version of the DaVinci code or the Boys from Brazil or even Shockwaves. Instead you get something quite different, more psychological, more something like from David Lynch. That was actually a plus. But the way the story is told is just awful.Part of the trouble is the casting. Andrienne Barbeaus character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid. She just does not do that well, even at her age, though she certainly tried. The actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy. Most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie, or at least acted like it, rather than simply being quirky. The only one that I thought did really well was the daughter, Siri Baruc.Another big part is the pacing. It starts off very slowly. So slowly you might be tempted to turn it off. But then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughters suicide and the aftermath. But shortly afterward, it all becomes a jumbled mess. Some of this was on purpose, but much of it was just needlessly confusing, monotonous, and poorly focused.The real problem, is it is simply not a pleasant movie to watch. It is slow, dull, none of the characters are likable. Overuse of imagery and sets. Some movies you see characters get tortured. In this, it is the viewer that does.

The one thing I thought was quite peculiar is when they landed, the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off, thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air. How did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that were not touching the ground? Did they forget the spoilers?

I was amazed in the event of an unfolding midair crisis how calm everyone seemed, surely someone would have panicked, and what a smooth flight, no passenger discomfort apparent  come on! Not sure about the regulations, nowadays some of the airline security stuff seems OTT nonsense, but why take your shoes off before the emergency landing, common sense tells me this is not a good idea! The shots of this massive airliner coming down on this remote airstrip were unconvincing and fake. In reality it would have been an awesome sight viewed from the ground nearby, in this movie it was out of proportion and looked like the model it probably was. Escape slides appeared at the front and mid emergency doors, yet nobody appeared to exit from the front, even though the drop was much less. The Captain went back into the plane after the landing  why? this was never explained. We know the emergency landing was due to being out of fuel, but even so there must have been some fuel sloshing around at the bottom of the tanks, and the risk of explosion must have been a very real danger, yet the evacuation seemed almost leisurely, and everyone stands around at the foot of the escape slides instead of getting as far away as possible, as I am sure I would have done. There were just too many inconsistencies, errors and faked action in this. I would have preferred to have seen a representation of the drama in real time, and with realistic motion of the plane portrayed. It had the potential to be quite thrilling, but doubtless due to the budget restrictions failed, and made one feel that a plane losing all engines was no big deal really, and you would safely glide down to a bit of a bumpy landing, but no real danger!  the reality of course being somewhat different!","label":0},{"index":9361,"txt":"I have nothing more to say but it was awful.

But watching this film to see Peter Sellers is a mistake.Sellers plays Amphibulos, a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the dirtpoor island nation of Gaillardia, formerly a British colony, now hosting a lot of Russian diggers during the height of the Cold War. Amphibulos wants to play both U.K. and Soviet interests against each other for easy profit, everything very friendly and all our cards under the table. TerryThomas is the title character, a lazy British diplomat anxious to show Gaillardia that Great Britain has not forgotten them, all appearances to the contrary.A positive review here says The reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated. I would argue that the reason CarltonBrowne is considered below average is because the comedy is nonexistent.After a decent opening that establishes the films only two strengths, a sympathetically doltish TerryThomas and John Addisons fullon larky score, things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes. The low opinion of CarltonBrowne by his boss and the obscurity of Gaillardia which no one can find on a map is milked to death. By the time we actually reach the island after a labored series of airsick jokes, expectations are quite low.They are still too high, though. The island itself, which seems to exist either in Latin America or the Mediterranean, is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport, and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade. The army is apparently still horse drawn, allowing for another lame aural gag by a thickaccented announcer In war, the army uses many horse.Sellers never quite takes center stage even when we are on his characters island. The plot is taken over instead by Ian Bannen as King Loris, who inherits the throne of Gaillardia after his fathers assassination. Bannen is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written. Normally this would make him the likely target for scenestealing by Sellers, but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy moustache, Sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year, The Mouse That Roared and I am All Right, Jack.Strange that this film, like Jack, was a Boulting Brothers production, with Roy Boulting here serving as codirector alongside Jeffrey Dell. Usually Boulting films combine wicked social satire with anythinggoes comedy, but here there are only fey jabs in either direction. Amphibulos works his mangledEnglish vibe for all its worth This man is like, how do you say, the bull in the Chinese ship while CarltonBrowne is generally ragged on by his superior far more than he seems to deserve.The weakest and most protracted element of the film is young Loriss romance with Ilyena. Score one point for her being played by ravishing Luciana Paluzzi, dock one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never addressed.The film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one, and a final bit of action by CarltonBrowne that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally.

The STORY of 7EVENTY 5IVE, on the other hand, is that of a horror film that had a wee little bit of promise, sadly outweighed by really bad writing.What could have been a fun, if somewhat silly, oldfashioned slasher tale is derailed early on by its filmmakers misguided belief that the audience would enjoy watching a bunch of loud, whiny rich kids bitching at each other for most of the films running time. With the exception of a police detective played by Rutger Hauer, in a minor role that is designed mainly to add the movies only star power every character on screen is a different breed of young Ahole.Male and female, black and white, straight and gay, an entire ensemble of shallow and shrill college kids carries the bulk of the films narrative. Worse, since the tale deals with a PARTY game gone awry, most of the time the scenes are completely filled with these little bds. Because of this, there are few breaks for the viewer, who must put up with the angry sniping of the thinlydrawn protagonists. Even though at least some of these people are supposedly friends, invariably all characters interact in a very hostile manner, long before any genuine conflict has actually arisen. This leads to the worst possible result in a slasher film The audience, intended to care about the leads, instead not only cheers on the anonymous killer, but wishes that he had arrived to start picking off the vacuous brats far earlier.The real shame of this poor characterization is that otherwise 7EVENTY 5IVE actually DID have some potential. Visually it is fine. Firsttime directors Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor know how to build a suspenseful mood. They also manage to deliver on some competent, if sparse, moments of classic 80sstyle gore. Surprisingly, the productions cast is also fairly able. It is not that the actors are not capable of expressing realistic human emotion; it is simply that the screenplay cowritten by newcomer Vashon Nutt and director Hooks, who fared much better behind the camera than with a keyboard is short of such moments.7EVENTY 5IVE can hardly be recommended, as its familiar premise and few thrills cannot outweigh the bad taste left behind by a story driven by a gaggle of unpleasant characters.

It is noisy, fragmented, energetic and consist of a bunch of half hearted contraptions thrown together to make something that does not have much in common with anything else present. The film is basically a series of zany action sequences that are kind of pasted together with characters and an uneven story that only kids between the ages of 69 would enjoy.The cop who is dramatically reinvented is played by Matthew Broderick, who, until Inspector Gadget, was on a success spree with movies like Election. His character becomes Inspector Gadget after an encounter with the films heavy handed villain named Claw. He is played by Rupert Everett, who has already experienced catastrophe this year with the dreadful William Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream.There is a romantic subplot in this movie as well as ample amounts of scenes involving Inspector Gadgets wacky body parts and mechanism elements. It has Gadget and Claw drooling over the attractive character Brenda, played by Joely Fisher, for both her looks and her knowledge of a specific invention made by her late father, who was earlier killed by Claw. Competition evolves into fight scenes and a reason for many happenings in the film. Also a major character is the Gadget Mobil, a life like automobile that is devised for Inspector Gadget himself. It is voiced by D.L. Hughly from the sitcom comedy The Hughlys.Inspector Gadget is a movie that I found quite bad. I know, I am not exactly a target audience of the filmmakers, but even my ten year old relative found the film to his disliking. The movie is full of distinct flaws and obvious problems. I never found myself caring about the characters. There is no mood development beyond some neat opening credits, unlike the much worse 1997 film, Mr. Magoo, which opened using clips of the original cartoon. Is it too much to ask for that same type of thing in this comedywhich is seldom funny and hardly ever convincing. The overall production design is nothing but a mess of incomplete sight gags and consists of one joke Inspector Gadgets bumbling goofiness.In movies like this the audience lusts for boundariessomething to help make out what can happen and what can not. In Inspector Gadget there are no such boundaries. This is truthfully nothing more than a party time for the actors, who surly had lots of fun. I am reminded of another lacking comedy released a few years ago called Blankman which again, contained lots of props and energy, and the actors certainly had fun time with all the gizmos and props, but it too lacked something needed for every movie audience participation.A character that I found being left out a lot is Gadgets daughter, who by the end of the movie, I still has not clue of what her name was. She is used only as a plot deviceand I question how she was used to further the plot as well. For her presence brings nothing relevant or productive to the film. We never know her reactions to her fathers operation or accidents. Thus, this is someone who could have been completely left out and would have not affected the movie a bit.In closing, I would like to state that Inspector Gadget is an awful, insufficient excuse for a childrens comedy. And believe it or not, I find myself comparing this film to last years violent and very antiyoung audience action picture Blade.

At home, the Empire is run by amiable dolts, benevolent Tories who are so inbred that they cannot distinguish close relatives; the Offices of Government consist of long forgotten archives a dig at Orwellian paranoia?, inhabited by indolent rats, and anterooms wherein lounge bored synacures, reading popular novels.Abroad, Britain clings to the old pomp; but pomp out of context looks threadbare and silly, especially when its embodied in bumbling twits. CarltonBrowne is an unsentimental picture of decline, with none of the lachrymose rot that marred the supposedly antiimperialist Jewel in the Crown.The film is also about the Cold War, bravely admitting that it is a dangerous farce, whose participants deserve mockery and contempt, not fear and respect. It is about how colonialism, characterised more by neglect than tyranny, destroys the colonies it deserts, robbing them of amenities, power, and, most importantly, selfrespect, leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboys.It is the seriousness, of course, that kills it. That is not to say that weighty subjects cannot be treated in comedy  The Miracle Of Morgans Creek, Dr. Strangelove and The Life Of Brian have all proved that. Indeed, one might suggest that serious themes should only be treated by comedy  it allows for a clearereyed view.The problem with CarltonBrowne is that every situation must have a significance beyond the merely comic, so that it becomes weighed down and unfunny. In the three films mentioned above, much of the comedy arises from character reaction to an extreme situation, not the extreme situation itself. Here, the script is too poor to sustain rich comic characterisations, and some of the greatest comedy talent ever assembled  Peter Sellers, TerryThomas, Raymond Huntley and John le Mesurier  are criminally wasted.TerryThomas, sublime so often, shows that he could not handle lead parts, and that he needed to play sneering, arrogant bounders, not brainless toffs. The music is made to carry much of the comedy, but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on screen. To be fair, unlike the majority of British comedies of the period, which were stagy and underproduced, the Boultings often try to make their points through film itself, by montage and composition Only Huntley manages to raise genuine laughs, and that is by essaying a character he could have played in his sleep.None of the Boultings farces have dated well  they are never thought through enough. Although CarltonBrowne revels in the decline of the Empire, it also seems to be antidemocratic and militaristic. I am sure this was not intended, but these blunders are bound to happen if you allow worthy intentions to take precedence over comic intelligence and film form.","label":0},{"index":9388,"txt":"This movie was so unrelentingly bad, I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who do not know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts and character relationships like one hinted at at the very beginning come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. westernepic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating true story that it attempts to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter. That is all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon Does not MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the subject matter is not good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that does not mean I am going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.","label":0},{"index":9389,"txt":"I really wanted to like this movie  the location shots were mostly filmed in Pittsburgh and the trailer had some wonderful photography.

However, that was only because I thought it was making fun of it, but then I realized it was yet ANOTHER product placement. I loved the cartoon. I used to watch it almost religiously. although i missed the last episode. I heard that they show Dr. Claw and it was nothing more than a Claw, somebody comment on the show is page The cartoon had Penny and Brain alot more than the movie had, as to that point. I hated the setup of the whole thing, reminiscent of Robocop. Then Broderick screws with the whole feeling of Inspector Gadget. He is not nearly as clumsy as the cartoon was. Another fact is his gadgets actually work to the point I saw, except for the oil slick. He also screwed with the tone of Wowsers which used to be in an excited tone. I felt so disappointed that they slaughtered the cartoon so badly. Everybody else felt that way too. Us 1417 year olds remember the cartoon fondly and we loved every minute of it.I went into the movie with an open mind, knowing that they would have screwed with the cartoon. I was taken aback at how retarded the movie was. It relied on sight gags, and stupid dialogue for humor. Disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a kids movie along. Product placement is pointless in this film, and it shows. The wisecracking car is not that good at cracking wise. The gadgets look nice, but they were almost overly glossy. The cartoon was a better look. The silly scenes were crap. In the 4045 minutes I watched the movie, not one laugh was heard, and they laughed at the DudleyDoRight preview.

Why is Rupert Everet Claw anyway? Were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes?

It was like Get Smart for kids. Bumbling boob cannot solve any case and all the work is done by the walking talking dog Brain and his niece Penny. I had heard the live action movie was decent so I checked it out at the library. I rented this movie for free and felt I should have been paid to see this.Broderick comes nowhere near the caliber of acting Don Adams had as the voice of gadget. His voice was all wrong. The girl who played Penny looked nothing like the cartoon Penny. She is brunette where the cartoon version was blonde with pigtails. But she does do a decent job given what she had to work with. Dabney Coleman gives a good performance as Cheif Quimby. Saldy he never hid in any odd place or had exploding messages tossed at him accidently by Gadget.The gadget mobile was wrong. It never talked in the series and it did fine. Why did they do this?Gadget was too intelligent in this film. In the show he was a complete idiot. Here he had a halfway decent intellect. It would have worked better if he was a moron.Also the completely butchered the catchphrase. Borderick says Wowser. It is and should always be Wowsers. It sounds lame with out the s. I got upset when they showed the previews and they did not have the correct phrase.The ONLY decent gags were during the credits. The lacky for Claw is in front of a support group for recovering henchmensidekicks. Seated in the audience is Mr. T, Richard Keil aka Jaws of Bond movie fame, a Herve Villacheze look alike, Oddjob, Kato and more. This is about the only part I laughed at.The other is at the end where Penny is checking out here gadget watch and tells brain to say somethin. Don Adams voices the dog saying that Brain is not in right now. Please leave your name at the sound of the woof. Woof. of course this is not laugh out loud funny, just a nice piece of nostalgia to hear Adams in the movie. He should have at least voiced the stupid car.Kids will like this, anyone over 13 will not.","label":0},{"index":9398,"txt":"I used to have a fascination with the cartoon back in college when it was being made.

Afterwords I wished it had never been made.Besides being miscast all around who on Earth though Broderick was even close to the role? it just did not make the grade.The effects were reasonable and perhaps the ONLY thing I liked about the movie; seeing a liveaction version of the gadgets in action! What was missing was a story and treatment which made it funny or charming or interesting.The original was a wacky cartoon with a very lighthearted attitude. It was FUN. The motion picture became murky and took itself FAR too seriously. If it had seriously had a great plot or went crazy enough to make it seem like a cartoon on film it might have been enjoyable.As it exists it does not deserve to be considered part of the Gadget Legacy.","label":0},{"index":9399,"txt":"You may want to know up front that I am not a Mormon, unlike a good number of those who have already reviewed this film. I mention this so you will understand that the way I look at the film may differ greatly from those in the faith. For some, being critical of the film might be seen as being critical of the faithand that is NOT my intention. So, my review is that of an outsider trying to look inside and learn more about who this man and his people were. Well, after seeing the film, I doubt if I have learned much at all. Since I have been a history teacher, I have a good basic understanding about Young as well as Joseph Smith as well as the teachings of the church. But anyone wanting to see this film to really learn anything will probably be disappointed because the film seems so goshdarn nicetoo nice and too unrealistic in its portrayal. Plus, you learn practically nothing about the churchs beliefs other than they are nice people, work hard and some have many wives and this latter part is only barely hinted at in the film. Instead, the people are almost cartoonlike in their simplistic portrayals. Joseph Smith and Brigham Young and their followers are angelic, the nonMormons were all devils and Brian Donlevy playing EXACTLY the same sort of role Edward G. Robinson later played in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is the troublemaker who claims to be a Mormon but just comes along so the film can have a bad guy. It is all so very simple....too simple. Almost like an indoctrination film or infomercial.Brigham Young especially was a very complex manwith many good points an excellent organizer and visionary as well as bad do not even get me started on his views about Blacks within the church or intermarriage. To portray him in such vague terms is just plain silly. It is also a lot like how Gandhi was portrayed in the film with Ben Kingsleyonly the facts that led to his being almost superhuman were emphasized. Heck, now that I think about that, this is the trouble with most religious filmsthey often come off as onedimensional, trite and bland. Let us have a full and more complete film of these menone that will stick to facts and not emotional appeals.Now if you can ignore the fact that you will not learn very much about the faith or its second leader, the film is enjoyable enough. It is obvious someone at 20th CenturyFox really cared about the film, as they had a wonderful cast of both premier actors Tyrone Power, up and coming actors Linda Darnell, Jane Darwell and Vincent Price and wonderful character actors Dean Jagger, John Carradine and Brian Donlevy. The film also had wonderful location shooting and lots of gloss. It just did not have a lot to tell us other than they were all swell. Plus, there were plenty of factual errors and a few just plain dumb scenes. A few of the mistakes include Young taking over the helm immediately after the death of Joseph Smith it was three years later, no mention of the various Mormon denominations and splinter groups, talk of gold in Californiaeven though it was 1847 and gold would not be discovered until 1948, as well as no specific mention of polygamy or Smiths many wives. Just plain dumb scenes include Carradine pulling out a gun and waving it about in the courtroom sceneand no one seemed to careeven though it was a very hostile audience! Do not you think at least the judge would tell him to put it away and stop threatening people with it?!One final comment. Do not, I repeat, do not watch this film when it is shown on American Movie Classics a one great station that has sunk a lot in recent years. While I am critical of the film because of its simplistic message, I was horrified with the complete disrespect the station had for the church and its traditions. What I mean is this. The film was punctuated with ads for penis enlargement formulas as well as tons of popups some advertising a show that features the sexiest cast. Talk about disrespectful and gross and I would be just as offended if they did this for any other religious film. By doing this, they not only insult the faith but marginalize their marketafter all, who is into hearing about these things AND the life of Brigham Young?! Is this a movie, in this form, that you can show to your kids or recommend to others?!","label":0},{"index":9400,"txt":"Once again, Disney manages to make a childrens movie which totally ignores its background. About the only thing common with this and the original Gadget cartoons is the names. The most glaring errors are the characters  Penny does not have her book, Brain has been reduced from a character to a fancy prop, Dr Claw is more a showoff than an evil villain, etc. but there are more than that. The horrors start from the first minutes of the film  having Gadget as a security guard called John Brown does not help identifying him as the classic Inspector Gadget. And right in the beginning we see Disneys blatant attempt to turn every story ever into a love affair between a man and a woman  they introduce Brenda, who only serves to make this movie Disneycompatible. Add to this the fact that the Claw seen in this film and the classic Dr Claw are almost diagonally opposite and you will see this is going to be nowhere near the original storyline. What would help would be a better storyline to replace it  but as you guessed, Disney failed in that too. The whole movie is just Gadget acting silly for sillinesss sake and lusting after Brenda. As if to add insult to the injury, Disney introduced the new Gadgetmobile  it does not look, function or think like the old Gadgetmobile at all, it is just the canonical comic relief figure. Disney obviously recognised that the Gadget cartoons were a comedy, so they made the film a comedy too, but they took out all the clever running gags like the assignment paper exploding in the Chiefs face and replaced them with Gadget being a moron, the Gadgetmobile being a wiseass, and Claw showing off. Someone should tell Disney that childrens movie does not imply total lack of any brain usage. Gadget should be targeted for children of 1012 years... not children of 1012 months like this movie. Whatever this movie is supposed to be, it is NOT, repeat NOT, the real Inspector Gadget.

I learned a lot of geography and history from the spinoff Inspector Gadgets Field Trip. I wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective ever.But the film has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon.Matthew Broderick, an actor with potential, was definitely NOT the role for Inspector Gadget. First thing in the film, Inspector Gadget is smart. Not so in the cartoon. In the film, Gadget solves the mystery mostly by himself. In the cartoon, it was almost always Penny, Brain, and the awesome book I still want her book!. If Gadget solved the mystery, it was by accident. Gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective, but in the cartoon was pretty dumb, which was where the humor came from.Another thing is that it is too much Good Guy v. Bad Guy in the film. It is not just meant to be a silly Saturday morning cartoon. Also, Gadget never should have a love story, but Disney Corporation is filled with idiots.Also I miss the true gadgets that Gadget had, and especially the Gadget car. In the movie it was a chic convertible. In the cartoon it was a sedan police car and could turn into a van. It also barely had any gadgets and was mainly there to get him from place to place.But if anything, the one thing that was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature movie. Inspector Gadget was a silly Saturday morning cartoon.

And yet heres another clean ripoff, a Spanish one this time, that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy who I must admit looks quite hot here plays the honorable priest who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leilas behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. At first the priest does not believe it but when Johns body is discovered with its neck twisted, Leilas demonic behavior becomes more noticeable... Exorcism is not only very unoriginal, it is also an insufferably boring film! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore, and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama thatll nearly put you to sleep! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, albeit very stupid, and there is quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze. The absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since Paul Naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money. This is just an awful film, end of story. Other European The Excorcist ripoffs are The Antichrist and Beyond the Door and they suck as well!","label":0},{"index":9403,"txt":"While I certainly consider The Exorcist to be a horror classic, I have to admit that I do not hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do.

In fairness to the other Exorcist ripoffs, this is often considered one of the worst, and so maybe it was not the best place for me to start. It is not hard to guess what the plot will be basically it is the same as the one in The Exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit which happens to be the spirit of her dead father. The village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this one stars Paul Naschy, who is pretty much the best thing about the film. Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the derivative Spanish Giallo The Killer Wore Gloves. I have not seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two I believe that originality was not one of his strong points.

Unfortunately, these kind of extracurricular activities have left Leila open to demonic possession from the dreaded spirit of evil. Leila also comes from a screwed up family, which does not help either. Her older brother John is a recluse who seems to be in love with her. Her mother Patricia Maria Perschy is depressed because she thinks she was responsible for the fathers death. To top it off, her sister Maria Kosti is a slutty semi pro golfer named gasp! Debbie Gibson. There is plenty of hired help around also to waste more time. Two maids a young one who takes her clothes off a lot and an old one who spies on everyone, plus Udo Luis Induni, a bald voyeuristic handyman who spies on Leila changing clothes, takes nude pictures of her and sneaks into the pool house to take a sniff of her freshly used bathing suit. Oh yeah and Borg, the pet German Shepherd.Paul Naschy is Father Adrian Dunning, the doubting priest zzzzz who starts snooping around after John and Richard both have their heads twisted around backwards. Leila tells him They say I am perverse and I am going to prove it is true! During her birthday party, she tells her guests You make me sick! I hate you all! and when mom suggests having a doctor come over she she screeches I do not want to see that fat ass! Debbie suggests they commit Leila to a sanitory, but Leila runs off and joins the cult again. She is rescued again and brought back home for the third time.By this point in the movie, there is only about ten minutes left to go and all we have basically seen is some very boring scenes of characters talking and whining about how terrible and fed up their lives are and how Leila is acting weird. It is almost as agonizing to sit through as an Andy Milligan movie, minus the gore and laughs. But finally during the last few minutes we get the movie the title implies  an EXORCISTlike possession flick. Unfortunately, the best part of it are the contact lenses Leila gets to wear. Some cheap timelapse slashes appear on her arms, legs and face, she gets scabby lips and her eyes take on the appearance of blue and white marbles. She begins reeking of rotted flesh, spits up some clear gunk, starts speaking in her dead dads voice, sneaks into her moms bedroom, slaps her around a bit and calls her a filthy bitch of a whore. In comes Father Adrian, who now finally believes she is indeed possessed, fends off her attempts at seduction, hallucinates frogs and eels are in the kitchen and douses Leila with holy water. Doors open and close, a mirror breaks, there is sudden thunder and her bed rises up off the floor. After she tackles Dunning and the two roll down the stairs, the spirit is out of her and into  guess who? Why, Borg the family pooch! The demon dog then turns on Adrian and chews him up a little before he impales it on a fire poker. Then we get one of the most irritating final shots ever committed to film. It is Leila on the floor going from her hideous appearance back to her normal sexy self. But then there is ANOTHER timelapse effect that sort of seems to suggest that the demon has possibly reentered her body.

It sort of forces you to watch the movie again but no way I am going to do that. It is that I watched this movie in the morning, I am sure of it that if I watched this movie in the evening I would had fallen asleep. To me the movie was like a poor mans Blade Runner.The movie leaves far too many questions and improbabilities. It makes the movie leave a pointless and nonlasting impression.Also the weird look of the movie does not help much. The movie is halve CGIhalve real life but it is not done halve as good, impressive, spectacular and imaginative as for instance would be the case in later movies such as Sin City and 300. They even created halve of the characters of the movie by computer, which seemed like a very pointless and odd choice, also considering that the character animation is not too impressive looking. Sure the futuristic environment is still good looking and the movie obviously was not cheap to make but its style over substance and in this case that really is not a positive thing to say.Some of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting. The main God of the movie constantly says lines such as; I am going to do this but it is none of your concern why I want to do it. Than just do not say anything at all Mr. Horus! It is irritating and a really easy thing to put in movie, if you do not care to explain anything about the plot. Also the deeper questions and meanings of the movie gets muddled in the drivel of the movie and its script.The actors still did their very best. They seemed like they believed in the project and were sure of it that what they were making would be something special. So I cannot say anything negative about them.The story and movie is far from original. It ripoffs from a lot of classic and semiclassic, mostly modern, sciencefiction movies.

We start with two different narratives, this female that is somehow turning human, a god that is for some reason being judged, but getting one last fling on Earth, and this mysterious John character who seems to be developing some sort of resort just beyond the bounds of the city. Why? None of these questions are answered. But do we care, no. There is no development to want us to empathize with any character in the story, the closest we get Jill and even then the development is spotty at best.

So many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized. The dialog was almost laughable at some points. Random characters and events that are not needed. Dull characters. Jill is supposed to be this mystery, but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer. There is nothing to her. She is uninteresting and boring to watch. She has no substance, no texture. Her character has no redeeming qualities. In fact, there is not one character in the entire film who has any purpose, any goals besides the obvious one of Horus, any motivation. They are weak and illconceived. There are no stakes  the key to screen writing. Horus will not become immortal, but, big deal, he is a bad guy. One cannot even decipher whether Horus or Jill is the main character. That is the problem devoting half the movie to each character means the writer never fully explores one character, never brings one to fruition. They are cardboard cutouts who walk around and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore the fine set pieces. First time director pacing. Slow, slow, slow.

It almost feels like there is a first half of this movie but it never got made.We are told that a mysterious pyramid has appeared over New York City and that Central Park has inexplicably become an arctic wasteland. Yet none of this seems to have caused much of a stir amongst the general population and is only of minimal concern to the government.We are presented with the evil corporation in Eugenics but that is really just a convenient conceit to populate the universe with a couple powertripping minions.

Then again, when a film is directed by a martial artist and written  produced by another member of his family, you know you should not expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble do get some amusing banter going early on, and the film might have turned out better if it had focused more on their lovehate relationship. But after about 20 minutes they get separated, and the film slows to a crawl, and even with the occasional fight scene to liven things up, it lacks excitement. The finale has Trimble fighting Qissi inside a cave and Sheperd going womanoawomano against the beautiful Ashley Hayden on a speedboat, but the fights are intercut in a way that breaks their flow and diminishes their value.

Well, there is no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk, only pretentiousness! This man should really stick to making comics, since he fails on all possible accounts as a director. Worst of all is the terrible digital animation, which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience. The graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in Van Helsing look like live actors! And since half the characters are CGIanimated, it is quite a problem that the CGIeffects look so fake.

The story is set in a futuristic New York city, filled with Blade Runnerstyle sky advertisements and some similar debates about cloningsynthetic humans. Unfortunately, the screenplay was not condensed enough for an hourandfortyfiveminute movie. Three groups exist in this world humans, artificial humans, and Egyptian gods. The artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city. The humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid modeled on the Great Pyramid of Khufu, and complete with a deteriorated exterior, leaving a smooth cap on the pyramid. Would not a floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition?. The pyramid rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why it is there. I will not bore you with the socalled plot, but there is lots of unnecessary gore and many grossout scenes. The film, as I said, looks to have been influenced by Blade Runner, and perhaps also by The Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the film credits were listed thankyous to the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. The film is FRENCH, but uses British actors who do not speak French.

Bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and he does not do a very good job at it, either.The most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the friendshiphate relationship between Nikopol and Horus. They were both out of their right time and place, forced together by circumstance. Most of all, they were funny and likable. Not so here. Nikopol has no discernible personality whatsoever, and Horus is a pompous twit who just wants to get laid.

I watched it three times, once with commentary, and I found myself getting annoyed at all the closeups, all the times the screen just blacks out, and worst of all, I feel the film never really resolves anything. Yes, the priest dies, but he did not really seem at peace with the town that gave him so much grief, or with himself. That and he was an idiot. If it were not for the commentary by Peter Cowie which explained not only the movie but the book it came from, I would not have been able to stomach it at all. I enjoy French movies, but this is one that was completely absurd.Diary of a Country Priest is filmed in beautiful black and white photography but, that alone cannot save this deadly dull tripe. Scene after scene of extreme closeups where characters do not say anything until the camera cuts away and goes to a black out do NOT make an interesting or relevant story. How this film ever became a classic is mind boggling it reminds me more of The Emperors New Clothes.Yes, Claude Laydus performance is heartfelt and thought provoking, if you are a sadist, but this film left me feeling empty because overall it is a weak impression of the Catholic priesthood, which is an ignoble and inglorious institution of corruption. The young priests triumph over the countesss pride is a weak scene but 90 of the film will drag you down with its dreary introspection and window into the young priests melancholy thoughts. This priest does not come across so much as being humble as he does just plain pitiful.Being that I do not speak or understand French I was looking forward to doing the English SUBTITLE thing to help understand the film. Well, the English SUBTITLE is at times impossible to viewread and the text rolls by so quickly that there was much I could not read and I am not a particularly slow reader  I just finished Dostoyevsky in 3 days.

Lead actor Claude Laydu, from the films opening to its end, wears the same wearying and annoying mask of agony as to be practically indistinguishable from the films eternal, dreary voiceover. Filming one over the other might have worked better than subjecting an audience to both, as they basically say the same thing The priest of Ambricourt is a wretched human being. The story, about a persecuted priest who tries to help out a troubled rich family, does nothing toward making its characters remotely interesting or sympathetic, as the family are a bunch of unpleasant weirdos, and the priest, himself, comes across as a nosy pest. The last 30 minutes suggests some breathtaking message about grace and one mans suffering equaling that of others, but due to all the indulgent closeups of a suffering Laydu and the vague subtext in Robert Bressons script, all I felt was, Finally, it is over, let us have some icecream.

The plot involves a Hollywood film star named Don Bolton Hope, and his attempt to evade military service at the beginning of World War II, followed by his enlistment by mistake in a confused attempt to court a colonels daughter Dorothy Lamour. Boltons agent, played by Lynne Overman, and his assistant, portrayed by Eddie Bracken, enlist with him and the three are involved in various escapades regarding training exercises, filmed in the Malibu, California, hills. Paramount budgeted handsomely for this effort, employing some of its top specialists, but direction by the usually reliable David Butler was flaccid, and this must be attributed to a missing comedic element in the scenario. A shift toward the end of the film to create an opportunity for heroism by Bolton is stillborn with poor stunt work and camera action in evidence. Oddly, Lynne Overman is given the best lines and this veteran master of the sneer does very well by them. Dorothy Lamour looks lovely and acts nicely, as well, and it is ever a delight to see and hear Clarence Kolb, as her father, whose voice is unique on screen or radio, but there is little they can do to save this film, cursed as it is with an error in script assignment.","label":0},{"index":9428,"txt":"Let us see...I am trying to practice finding the positive in everything, so what kind thing can I say about the Pallbearer?I know!

To find oneself in the awkward position of having to align audience sympathies with a character even MORE clueless than Ross is certainly a tough ask even for as able a comic performer as Schwimmer, but I guess he can find fault with himself for signing on to some seriously echoing situations in the first place.How will he ever escape his most famous portrayal if he is picking scripts where the characters could almost be interchangeable, even if the situations are not?

In comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX, consider that PHOENIX as made by Warners had no story, certainly no acting was allowed by the director, the photography was dreadful, and the wallofsound overbearing musical score was just a mess. I rated Phoenix a 1 because the scale does not go any lower. THE DECOY is 4 times better  in all regards.If you have the opportunity, give THE DECOY a chance. Remember, this is not Decoy 3  the Shootout or any such nonsense. It is original. If your expectations are not overblown by the foolish 10 scores here, you might just enjoy the film on its own terms.","label":0},{"index":9447,"txt":"We rented the DVD hoping for a good western. The film was pretty and the scenes reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. Here are my problems with the film.In the first part, why exactly did the bad guy kill the mine owner? Not really connected to the movie except to establish how bad he was and to have a hideout.The bank employee gone bad just acts too poorly to convincingly decide to hire killers to off his employers. At least keep us guessing. No character developed at all for the bank owners or the bank employee.Very long delay in much of anything happening.Absurd premise that Martin still needed to see the judge after the gang confessed to killing the inlaws. Even more absurd that he confesses to judge and judge will not listen to the sheriff guy. even more ridiculous that Martin his hung and rope breaks then the sheriff takes him at gunpoint to finally head back to his town and save his wife from the bad bank employee. Would not he just return after the quick dispatch of the gang to save wife and arrest bad bank guy? Just send the judge a note that gang confessed before being killed on trail????!!!

The template used in most of these films was to hire recognizable American actors, whose careers were largely in decline and dub their voices. This film is no exception except for the fact that they used some British actors as well.It is difficult to summarize the plot, but here goes. The story opens with rebels or whatever, led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau raiding a church and killing everyone inside, including the priest. Fast forward to the subject town a few years later where the Shaw character is masquerading as a priest. The mayor of the town Telly Savalas is a brutal leader who thinks nothing of meting out justice with his gun.Throw into the mix a grieving widow Alvira Stella Stevens who is searching for her husbands killer. Add to this the fact that she rides around in a hearse lying dead like in a coffin for God knows why. After the mayor is murdered by his henchman La Bomba Al Lettieri the town is invaded by a federale Colonel Landau in search of a rebel leader I am sorry but the name escapes me. The Colonel takes over the town and begins summarily executing the townsfolk to force them to reveal the identity of the leader.Even though they opened the film side by side, its difficult to tell from the dialog that the Landau and Shaw characters know each other. A blind man Fernando Rey claims he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face. He does so and..............................................I am sure the principals regretted making this film. It is just plain awful and well deserving of my dreaded 1 rating. Shaw spends most of the film fixating his trademark stare at whomever is handy. Even Landau cannot salvage this film. The beautiful Ms. Stevens is totally wasted here too. Having just made Peckinpahs The Ballad of Cable Hogue the previous year, I found it odd that she would appear in this mess of a movie. Savalas made several of these pictures, Pancho Villa and Horror Express come to mind during he preKojak period.Michael Craig is also in it somewhere as a character called Paco.Fernando Rey appeared in many of these westerns although he would emerge to play the villain in the two French Connection films. Al Lettieri would also emerge with a role in The Godfather 1972 and go on to other memorable roles before his untimely death in 1975.In all fairness, the version I watched ran only 88 minutes rather than the longer running times of 95 or 97 minutes listed on IMDb, however I cannot see where an extra 7 or 8 minutes would make much difference.Avoid this one.","label":0},{"index":9456,"txt":"This BritishSpanish coproduction is one of the countless films shot in Spain in the wake of the unexpected phenomenal success enjoyed by the Italian Spaghetti Westerns and, as is typical of such genre efforts, features an eclectic assortment of established and emerging international stars Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas, Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Fernando Rey, Michael Craig, Al Lettieri, Dudley Sutton, Antonio Mayans, etc. Ironically, however, this incoherent mess of a movie serves as a shining example as to why that most American of film genres became a dying breed in the 1970s and is nowadays practically or is that officially? extinct.I really wanted to like this film, not only because the Western is one of my favorite types of movies but also because it had all the qualities, including an intriguing premise, to be a good one  not to mention the fact that my father had purchased a paperback edition of A TOWN CALLED BASTARDs novelization following its original release! As it is, the films sole virtue if, indeed, it can even be called that is its sheer eccentricity for instance, Stevens, playing a widow out for revenge on the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband, sleeps inside a coffin! driven around in a carriage by her dumb manservant? Sutton; Savalas, as a bloodthirsty renegade, who at first appears to be the films main villain, is unceremoniously dispatched by his own henchman Lettieri very early on in the picture; the villain of the piece, then, turns out to be Landau who, in the films very first scene, is seen pillaging sidebyside our legendary heroturnedpriest Shaw!; Fernando Rey, playing a blind peasant, is the only one who can identify rebel Shaw who, in the end turns out to have been merely a front for...well, nevermind!

Fernando Rey is in it too as a blind man. The performances are not bad, but they are mightily uneven. Savalas has an accent sometimes as does Landau who is really grating here.

Another user comments that we see the entire inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning; not in any of the copies I have. There are some abrupt cuts of peasants firing their rifles, one Mexican officer is shot, Shaw and Landau celebrating, and that is it. We never find out why Shaw has become a priest if he really is, we never find out what happens to Don Carlos Savalas although I suspect he was called home to star in Kojak, as his departure seems arbitrary. And there is a strange flashback sequence where Michael Craig Mysterious Island is dancing around in a bowler hat and bad suit in the great old English music hall tradition to the 1960 hit BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, not sung by Johnny Horton here but with some lyrics I have never heard before. On the plus side, the location is great, a huge old ruined fortress with Escherstyle stairs leading nowhere, some nice scenerychewing by Robert Shaw, and good performances by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri, and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas.

To me it was rather a disappointment, especially the combination of historical facts, fantasy and the main characters internal turmoil does not work at all in Vonneguts book Slaughterhouse Five and even in George Roy Hills adaptation for the screen it does. Credibility is often overstretched. Too many questions are left open. Did I miss some central points? Or did I fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots? A boy called Campbell, Jr., grows up in upstate New York. At home his father has many technical trade papers and one book. It has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it. The boy leafs through the book, his dad does not like his doing that. What should this tell me? The family moves away from upstate New York to Berlin. BANG. It is 1938, the boy is a married man in Berlin and a theater playwright. What kind of plays does he write? In what language? Is he successful? His wife is an actress and looks glamorous. The parents move back to the USA and invite their son to do the same. He does not. Why? Because having grown up in Germany he feels more German than American? Because he is successful? Because his wife is? Because he likes his life there? Because he likes the Nazis? Because he is just plain lazy and does not like change? Do not ask me.Possibly, the man just does not care, is not interested in politics, is a kind of an existentialist. He states that he is deeply in love with his wife. He speaks of his Republic of Two meaning he and his wife. There is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie, it much more seems a Republic of One.On the request of an American agent Campbell, Jr., agrees to broadcast anti Semitic Nazi hate propaganda to American listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to American authorities who read between the lines. The crucial meeting with the agent on a Berlin park bench is short, unexciting and anti climactic, the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation, the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast.So now we have Campbell, Jr., presenting himself over the air as the Last Free American. The scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting  although one wonders what happened when Campbell, Jr., really and honestly had to cough, hiccup etc. must have scrambled the messages terribly. Anyway, the Nazis lose, the wife dies touring in the Crimean for German troops  I never heard such tours really happened on German front lines in WW II, Campbell, Jr., says he goes to the Russian front but does not go, is captured by an American soldier who recognizes his mug how come?, is dragged to a sightseeing tour in Auschwitz, is then released and resettled with the help of the Crucial Agent somewhere in the City of New York.AND THIS IS WHERE THE STORY REALLY STARTS BANG. From now on it is like a short story by Paul Auster. It is 1961, Campbell, Jr., lives in New York tenement as a hasbeen and mourns the loss of his wife. Nobody really cares  or do they? Yes, somehow they do, and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction. Auschwitz survivors. A painter. Some American supremacists \u0084discover him and want him to be their figurehead. They even find his presumed dead wife for him, or is she his wife? Anyway, in the end Campbell, Jr., calls in at the Israeli consulate, and they obligingly give him the Big War Criminal treatment, placing him in the cell adjacent to Adolf Eichmanns. He writes his life story and, once this task finished, hangs himself on the typewriters ribbons without getting sooty the least bit.While I can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss, I just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone. So I found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss. Amazingly, many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero, having put his reputation at stake for playing the Last Free American. I assume according to them this took a lot of courage. As a matter of fact, however, the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment Campbell created for himself a winwin situation, as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war. The danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story.One might argue, that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything. But even then it fails to make a point, primarily, I suspect, because the love affair in the Republic of Two falls completely flat. This is a pity, especially if you consider that the wife was played by Sheryl Lee, a talented, versatile and sensuous actress. She has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous German accent. Another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts confession, broadcast and hidden messages, but I guess this is largely unfilmable.

The idea had something promising and inventive to build on, but the languid pacing begins to wear thin by the end and disastrous dialogue do not do it any favours at all. The humour tries, but more often does not come off, despite the hunger. The seductively Ann Dusenberry is pretty cold and manipulative throughout well after the painful ordeal and likes to gracefully bare it all quite a bit. Even the skimpy stripper outfit seems to get full workout for the opening half of the story. Popping up in amusing minor cameos ranged from Dick Millar, Mary Woronov, Olympia Dukakis, Fred Willard, Robert Culp and a favourite turn by Joe Spinell.Municipalians  A serial killer who leaves copies of his drivers licence behind after each murder, is being tracked down by an enthusiastically naive rookie cop and his old grizzled partner. However the young cop learns that being tough is the only way to go, when the pair encounter one situation after another.Stupid! Oh yeah. Sure if you are going to spoof something extremely overthetop, make sure laughter will stream off it. Obviously they forgot that! Even at its 30 minutes running, boy does it drag! Robby Bensons gratingly mock performance got rather overbearing with a wearied Richard Widmark doing very little as his partner. Christopher Lloyd underplays the role of serial killer, but his creepily wry and sympathetic performance works well and pretty much shows up the other leads. Elisha Cook Jr., Rhea Perlman and Harry Reems appear. When the jokes come, they truly feel out of sync and get rather stale with its repetitiveness of making fun of these cop clich\u00e9s.In all, the idiotic material laced with its skits comes across as disposable, and the unbearable script is basically inept and witless. Only one or two few gags make it out each segment, but really there is too many cheap stinkers or plain misses which stick in your head. This is because it virtually becomes what it is trying to poke fun at and this basically shows in each story. It loses sight. The performances range from hot to cold, but who cannot deny the embarrassment that is felt on most of their faces. Director Bob Giraldis first taste is a vapid one for Growing Yourself , but Success Wanters showed some minor flourishes of mild effectiveness. Henry Jaglom does a labouredly jaded job on Municipalians . Rick Meyerowitzs vividly crass drawings that opens the film, are neatly devised and go on to set the style and mood.This lowbrow comedy flunks it by overplaying it, with the main interested being derived by the familiar cameos. But really, is it worth going through this putridly lame and restless getup, just to spot them. Well, that is up to you.","label":0},{"index":9473,"txt":"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies is the worst movie ever made, surpassing even the witless Plan 9 from Outer Space. At least that movie was just inept; the Lampoon film, on the other hand, is both inept and mean. Once upon a time, movies used to respect their audiences intelligence. This one, however, holds a fetid, rotting carcass up to our faces  and then tries to rub our noses in it.Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are the nude scenes; and I agree, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh, and very nice flesh it is. But the directors seem not to realize that even TA needs a good story to surround it. There is none of that here.Perversely, the film makers save the worst for last. The third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio. In this vignette, Robby Benson plays an eagerbeaver young police officer reporting for duty on his first day on the job. He is paired with a weary, cynical oldtimer played by Richard Widmark. For just a moment, we are given hope that this film will end triumphantly. Surely, we think, the youngsters spunky attitude will rub off on the cynic and change him for the better.Forlorn hope! Instead, the cynic wins the day  and the youngsters spark is doused forever.

The acting, well other than one of two exceptions, is pointless since there is nothing in this material that merits any real effort.It looks like a bunch of little ideas, leftover from various writing sessions, that where thrown into a blender.

Good Night Elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff.

Skip it. Low budget, not funny, lousy script. Acting not quite as bad as the writing, but still bad. That is all you need to know, but I will continue for the sake of writing more than necessary.This is a film with three segments, each one parodying some other type of movie. A MUCH funnier film with this same exact idea is Movie Movie, with George C. Scott. Very obscure, but worth searching out. MM parodied films of the 1930s, and did it with elegance, precision and dry wit.This movie did not. It parodies three types of films, supposedly from the late 70s, early 80s era, only it is parodying films I have almost never heard of. The first is, I guess, a parody of Kramer Vs. Kramer, in a way. Peter Reigert does his best with a dirt poor script. The second is a parody, of, I do not know what...a Danielle Steele novel? I mean, you might see a story like this on Lifetime TV, but in a movie theater? I mean, I remember the 70s, I was there. This is a soapopera type parody about a fetching young woman who sleeps her way to power. These type of things usually parody themselves, so I do not see how this was even necessary.We are on somewhat easier ground with the third segment, The Municipalians, which parodies cop movies. I noted elements of The New Centurians and some Dirty Harry, both of which were almost 10 years old when the film was created. Yeah, nice and current. Robby Benson plays the idealistic young rookie overthetop wimpy while Richard Widmark plays the grizzled veteran cop who drinks whiskey while sitting in the police car OH! Stop! My sides! He is actually drinking booze in the Police car! How irreverent! Note that this was the first film after Animal House to have the National Lampoon name attached. Wow. To go in five years from that classic flick to this pile of dung is nothing short of shocking. I could go on for hours about the sad decline that caused one of the most cuttingedge and original voices in American humor that would be National Lampoon, the original magazine for about its first 10 years or so to sell out and begin a long, slow slide into a world of crap, where now the magazine is long gone and it only exists as a brand name to slap on lowbudget comedy films for a fee.

I laughed out loud during the notarizing of the margarine company handover pun intended.There are three segments in this movie. The first one is supposed to be a spoof of woman grows up and launches career movies. The Tampax\u00ae box was the funniest thing in this segment. Most of the cast members are not listed here on IMDb. They are the lucky ones. Few other people will be able to connect this thing to the ruin of their acting careers.The second segment is a spoof of sharkish woman sleeps her way to the top and seizes control of huge industry movies. Robert Culp has several funny moments, all physical humor, including the aforementioned handover. After his character dies the segment sinks lower and lower as Dominique Corsaire rises higher and higher. By the time she becomes First Lady I wanted to rip the cable out of the TV and watch snow. I switched to Pakistani music videos instead. I do not understand Urdu, or whatever language the videos were in. It was still better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully dull story.Then came Municipalians with the big stars, half of them on screen for less than a minute Elisha Cook, Jr., Christopher Lloyd, Rhea Perlman, Henny Youngman, Julie Kavner, Richard Widmark and ... Robby Benson. It is supposed to be a spoof of young cop teams with hardened, substance abusing older cop who needs retirement badly movies. The horizontal flash bar on the police car is very impressive. It was interesting seeing old RTD buses, and a Shell gas station sign, and an American Savings sign  none of them are around anymore. Nagurskis Never stop anywhere you might have to get out the car made me smile momentarily. Then they discuss how boring the young cop is. A lot. Back and forth about how boring he is. That was as boring as this description of how boring it is. Nagurskis Law Number Four, Never go into a music store that is been cut into with an acetylene torch, made me think that the music store is a real business at the actual location the dispatcher gave. Thinking about that was more interesting than the setup for the gag which followed. Young Falcone Benson gets shot. A lot. He becomes a hardened cop like Nagurski. The segment keeps going. On and on. And on. It will not stop. It rolls relentlessly onward no matter how many times you wish he would just die already so this thing will end. It does not. It goes on and on and on....

Whether you liked the stoner hippie days of the late sixties or the smug and sassy cokehead days of the seventies when the comedy was fortified with plenty of naked babes depends very much on your date of birth, but everyone agrees that by the early eighties, middle age had killed off whichever remaining sparks of anarchic humour that the drugs had not, and offerings like this film and the increasingly terrible spinoff records shot further holes in the hull. Outside of a nicely illustrated title sequence, there is absolutely nothing to recommend this singularly depressing stinkbug. If you make it through the baffling opening segment, Growing Myself, hoping things will get better, tough luck  they do not. Whoever thought the idea of a woman being brutally raped with a stick of butter was comedy gold deserved to have his head handed back to him on a platter of dog mess.

National Lampoons Movie Madness1. The movie is poor, even by Lampoons typical standards. 2. It is not funny. 3. No one goes to see a movie.So, after I finished watching it, I began wondering why on earth it is called National Lampoon Goes to the Movies, and why it was ever conceived, much less actually made. It would be like calling Austin Powers An American Guy Goes to the Movies. How lame. He is not American, and he does not go to movies. None of the characters in Lampoons socalled satire are funny, and none go see movies, which causes a bit of a problem. I had hoped it would be something in the vein of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it is not.This was National Lampoons first film after Animal House, although you could not tell it from the quality of film. Poorly developed, rough and amateurish by any standard, it induces headaches \u0096 not a good sign for an 89minute movie that seems double the length.I have noticed a pattern. Really bad movies are typically renamed \u0096 and this little disaster falls under that category. It has two separate titles  probably to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning it received from home video critics in 198283. Hmm, Movie Madness \u0096 I have never heard of this movie before! Let us rent it! And then, the realization Hey, wait a minute, this is just National Lampoon Goes to the Movies!It was shelved by MGMUA, never to be released into theaters or DVD; it occasionally pops up on television a few times per decade, which is just about the only place you will manage to find it.It is split up into three stories \u0096 a parody of selfenlargement videos, butter and corporate ruthlessness, and police brutalitycopbuddy films I guess. The first segment stars Peter Riegert Animal House as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff. I am not sure what because it was so boring my mind started to drift. Until the sex scene popped up.Part II is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter do not ask who decides to become Queen of the Margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products. Ouch! This contains the only funny line in the movie Only I can make love with my son! If you think that does not sound very funny, you are right \u0096 it is not. And just imagine \u0096 it is the highlight of this film!Part III is about a cop who chases down a serial killer Christopher Lloyd only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy. It does contain one funny scene but it is extremely overacted \u0096 only Lloyd really exhibits any humor, playing his character dry and compassionate, yet strangely surreal. The part where he is choking his victim and the meek cop stands by watching it all unfold, at least, evoked a chuckle or two.It is a shame to watch such a cast of semifamous names resort to low standards. The writers of each segment clearly believe that they are being very ironic and clever by spoofing socalled stereotypes \u0096 the fault being that the movie becomes one huge contradiction, favoring the standard T  A instead of plot; crude humor instead of witty dialogue; desperate performances instead of inspired ones. It is easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled with the material, muttering their lines, often so embarrassed they can seldom make eye contact with the camera.The movie is not funny, as I said before. I laughed once, at only one line, and even then it was a halfhearted one. Two chuckles, a smile, and a very weak laugh. Compared to Movie Madness, a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracks.I like National Lampoons Vacation series or, at least three of four installments, and their classic Animal House, but their recent slew of directtovideo bombs such as Golf Punks with that great comic genius Tom Arnold provide a good example of why their magazine went out of print more than a decade ago. It gets really old, really fast.Sad to see a new film, called Gold Diggers, is being released with their stamp of approval. It is like condemning a film before it even hits theaters \u0096 maybe they should start not advertising their name all over the place\u0085Distributor This movie is bad. It gets the National Lampoon stamp of approval. Thatll teach you not to make something so awful next time.Forget the death penalty. Just stick a bunch of criminals in a room and make them watch this over and over every day for a month.It is so bad that I cannot even begin to explain its putrid vileness.

National Lampoons was trying to follow up 5 years later on the success of Animal House, but they completely missed the mark. I will go chronologically with these short flicks.Short Film 1 Poor Peter Riegert Boon from Animal House. Apparently, he was not working back then, so the boys at National Lampoons probably called and said hey, we are making a cppy movie, wanna be in it? Peter was like well, I am not doing much these days, why not? He was a great side character in Animal House, but he could not carry this sorry short flop for 5 minutes.POSSIBLE SPOILER The premise is funny enough, with Jason Cooper Riegert telling his wife to leave him, she needs to find herself. It is too weird that they are actually in a happy marriage. So he chases her off, there she goes, and Cooper is in charge of the kids. This, off course, leads to him burning the house down, losing several of the kids, and sleeping with an assortment of New York bimbos including an ever so young Diane Lane. Then the wife comes back, wants the kids, and the film ends with a coin flip thatll decide the fate of the children. The idea was actually somewhat clever, but the director stunk. The characters all seem like they are falling asleep, they HAD to be doped up. Sorry Boon, your legacy was tarnished with this flop.Short Film 2 MORE SPOILERS Enter Dominique Corsaire. Pretty girl, recently finished college, not sure what to do with her life. So she becomes a slut, starts sleeping around with some mega rich guys, takes their money when they die, and she does not stop until she beds the most powerful man in the world, Fred Willard Ooops, I mean the president of the United States. Once again, it could have been funny, and though I was happy that Corsaire Ann Dusenberry in real life was not afraid to bare all, her acting was horrible. What a waste of time.Short Film 3 I cannot believe I made it this far. Heres the rookie cop Brent Falcone Robby Benson with veteran Stan Nagurski Richard Widmark. Falcone is young, naive, thinks he can really help people, though he becomes cynical after being shot several thousand times. Nagurski, really, has just given up caring. He watches muggings, assaults, you name it, and never intervenes. He figures the world is lawless and he will probably get sued if he does anything. Even Christopher Lloyd at the end of Taxis run gets in on the action, getting the police called on him, committing a crime, but having his lawyer there to protect him. God bless America!!Once again, could have been funny, the performances were intentionally campy, but goodness, no energy whatsoever. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi should be ashamed of having their names on this schlock. I think the writing was not bad, the ideas were there, but the execution was pulled off as well as the rescue attempt in the Iranian hostage crisis. If I had been a part of this film, I would want my name removed, it is horrible. Then again, that is why I watched it.The only good thing about this garbage is that Dr John did the film score repeating Going to the Movies over and over again and the film is not much longer than an hour and a half.

The movie edited down to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional, but alas it became so boringly long that I can only give it a 2 of 10. It is way below average.Some other problems also exist in this marathon. 1 Ralph Fiennes plays a whole family tree. The guy who played the Greatgrandfather looks nothing like him, but the Grandfather, Father and the son who gives us constant unneeded voice over are all Ralph Fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bullheaded personality. No one seems to notice that each of these children look like a clone of the last, even though photos of them are being snapped at every turn. This one is minor, but if the movie had not been 3 weeks long it would not have been so annoying.2 The fact that no news from Germany was even whispered for the longest time about Jews being rounded up and sent off is ridiculous. Some word would have gotten to them and the thought of trying to run off would probably have been discussed. The uncle in France would surely have sent warning to try and get them to leave.3 The love stories in this movie are totally wrong. You are spending forever telling us this thing and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short. Suddenly... people are in love and almost instantly... married.

This name literally translates to Sunshine. The family has humble beginnings, then is prosperous, becomes upwardly mobile, changes it is name, and hopes to assimilate into Hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally. The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who missed the WWII and the Holocaust in Europe, the Sonnenschein approach to life does not work out very well.Sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success, but it is an opportunity missed. The story line, dominated by world history, is predictable and transparent; this is reinforced with voice cover narration and newsreel footage. The family plot lurches from one predictable event ie. the Hapsburgs, WWI, WWII, Fascism, Communism, etc. to the next with little continuity, depth or detail. The Jewish assimilation theme is unfocused, and important subthemes the secret diary and family philosophy that could have given the family character and credibility are l ost until the very end. Alternatively, the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest  infidelity.Ralph Fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance but his performance is far from award winning material. The 3 for 1 casting format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater. Sunshine is basically Hungarian History Channel material.

Walker also meets a cute homeless Mexican kid who sleeps at the jailhouse. One night, Andres is snoozing when a villain and another man dressed in Army blue take the remaining brother into the street and kill him, pinning the murder on Walker. Not good for your first twenty four hours on the job. Walker visits the local Army fort, and rankles the chains of the commander. The bigwig hears of his brothers deaths, and rides back to town in time to get his chains rankled as well. The local native population, who get short changed by the Army on their beef, also get rankled in the chains area. With all these chains getting rankled, Walker still has time to woo the local hotel owner. The Army guy involved in the murder ends up dead, the local cattle buyer is implicated, the indians do a lot of hesitant speechifying, and the climax brings about an unlikely showdown as Walker must prove to the town that the villainous cattle buyer had a boss, someone we have suspected as being too helpful all along.There is a semisubplot involving the death of Walkers family at the hands of Army raiders, and I think this would have been the force behind the series, had it been picked up. Instead, the film ends abruptly, and I kept waiting for scenes from next weeks exciting episode. Because of the fade outs for nonexistent commercial breaks, the pacing is all off on this and its story jumps in fits.Walker is handsome, rugged, and has a voice deeper than a well. The rest of the cast is full of television actors you have probably seen in other television movies. Much of the action is pretty lame, and the violence is tepid. The first brother killed gets a shotgun blast midtorso, and falls without a scratch on him. I did not expect Reservoir Dogs, but this is the wrong film to use to teach children about the evil of guns! Speaking of children, the Mexican kid here goes from cute to aneurysm inducing annoyance very quickly.If you dislike westerns, then you will dislike Yuma.

Money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film. But this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to rebound.If you were stuck out in the woods, your childhood best friend dying from an unknown disease, other friends dying around you, stranded in a strange place, what would you do?A. Run away from everyone and try your luck on your own. B. Have sex with your friends girlfriend. C. Take a hot bath to relax your sorrows to include shaving your legs. D. Bash in the head your childhood best friend and lifelong crush with a shovel. E. All of the above.According to Eli Roth, none of these answers are that far fetched. In fact, all are plausible and well represented in Cabin Fever. The total lack of reality and illogical attempt at explaining what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film in the bonehead bin at your local rental store. Stay away. Stay far away.","label":0},{"index":9496,"txt":"no redeeming qualities can possibly be expressed. i wish i could get my time back. nice skull face broad really smiles, bright at the camera when the disease has already wreaked enough havoc on the ill informed script. i was spoiler happy to see all the characters dead or severely incapacitated by the end, especially the party poopers that drink the tainted juice on their way to the alleged sunset. Eli Roth does shine for moments of maybe ten, putting forth the theory on how well weed smokes in the woods when others really fiend on top of beer consumption. overall, i found most of it pointless, though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity, happy to witness the demise of cast, in a way though, wishing that journey never happened probably should have been getting laid instead of watching TBS late night, ugh.","label":0},{"index":9497,"txt":"Sure I have seen bad movies in my life, but this one was so bad that I actually became angry in the theater.

Unfortunately for this show, the only two ingredients of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility.","label":0},{"index":9499,"txt":"If the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless, one might well refer to Ned Kelly as an Australian Western. For the people Down Under, Ned Kelly was, apparently, a folk hero bandit akin to Robin Hood, Jesse James, Bonnie and Clyde, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The descendant of Irish immigrants, Kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an Australian law officer, a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison. To get back at the government for this mistreatment, Kelly, his brother Dan, and two other companions, became notorious bank robbers, winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where Irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country.Perhaps because we have encountered this gentleman bandit scenario so many times in the past, Ned Kelly feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genres stereotypes and clich\u00e9s on its way to the inevitable showdown. Ned is the typical heartofgold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and, even then, only with the deepest regret. He also has the pulse of the common folk, as when, in the middle of a bank robbery, he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers, after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it. What movie on this particular subject has not featured a scene like that? It is acts of selective generosity like this, of course, that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powersthatbe and the status quo. Geoffrey Rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment. There is even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers, so turned on is she by the romantic derringdo of the criminal lifestyle. And the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another.Heath Ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role, providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging. It does not help that he has been forced to provide a droning voiceover narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film.Ned Kelly might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in Australian history, but as an entertainment, it is just the same old story told with different accents.","label":0},{"index":9500,"txt":"This film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods. One of the friends catches a horrifying flesheating virus. Suddenly, the friends turn on one another in a desperate attempt to keep from contracting the disease themselves.Cabin Fever is a horrible film. For one, it tries to be many genres at once. Is it supposed to be a homage, a slasher, a black comedy, or a scary movie with unintentional comedy? Nobody can tell. There is a serious scene at first and a second alter, it turns funny. When the film tries to be funny, the humor is quite bland, excluding the ending. I liked the ending a lot.But apart from the ending, I was pretty disappointed and disgusted. The violence is cringeworthy, more looking away from the screen than being scared. The tone changes within each scene, sometimes funny, sometimes scary, and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see a girl doing karate in slomotion. What are we supposed to get from that? This same girl would bite one of the characters. Was that supposed to be funny? I do not know.Some of the performances were decent, and many were quite amateurish. I did not care for most of the characters. I liked the plot but the execution was done horribly. As a horror film, I did not know what it was trying to be. I did not find it funny, tense, nor scary. By the end, you are left indifferent, thinking, What have I just been through?

The film follows five college graduates into a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal as one after the other succumbs to this mysterious, fastacting, flesheating disease. It is not long before the friends turn on one another, and can barely stand the sight of one another, much less want to be in the same vicinity as them. As gross as it all sounds, there is a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked, in the hands of a less cocky filmmaker. Unfortunately what we end up with is poorly drawn characters whose sole purpose seems to be to look beautiful at the beginning to make the inevitable decomposition more contrasting, a hackneyed script so profanityladen as to leave the viewer tuning out the dialogue, and several incomprehensible subplots that motivate little more than in one instance an onscreen appearance by director Roth.

There are so many scenes in this movie that makes one just stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew just stopped caring at some point.

As it turns out, the first film from the new impresario Eli Roth, it is just a soso effort with the IQ points dropping as the film progresses. There are worse movies out there, and surely more gory ones while I am not sure how the hypemeter got so high on the bloodcount for Hostel, there is a good amount for genre fans here. The premise is not necessarily bad either though kids go to a cabin for a week of partying, only to come across a very sick man, covered in blood, whom in a panic they set on fire. He winds up dead in the water that feeds the reservoir, and soon the characters all succumb to the flesheating virus one way or another. The characters, either the lead college kids including Rider Strong as the hero and James DiBello as the goofy sidebar or the supporting village folks are archetypal to the point of inertia, if not painfully so. As they meet their fates, the townspeople get pretty weird, and it just seems to be nonsensibly thrown together without the many laughs; Pancakes kid comes out of nowhere, and maybe might have been funnier in another movie or by itself, but in the context of the rest of the movie, it just does not work. There is also a young police character who is even dumber and less convincing than the others. And the family that goes after DiBello following an incident has some possibilities that are not realized. But all the while, Roth pumps up his script with common sense out the window and sudden scares and frights with people hacking up blood on one another and a killer dog rambling around. Which is not all for not either. Now, unlike lesser Troma horror movies or even lesser ones of the 70s or 80s to which I am sure Roth is a diehard fan he does not make it unwatchable. It is also smart to not have any explanation for where the virus comes from. But unlike those films too, he also does not really have a fine idea of what makes for great campyhorror times. His film tries for that, of course, and only once or twice does he make it a goofy, bloody time I did like the random bunny Strong sees while on the gurney. It is not even very poorly shot a lot of the time albeit with its own contrived stylechoices ala red tint on the lens or that story with the bowlingalley worker. It simply contains a lot of illogical scenarios and choices made shave your legs with a deadly virus, uhhuh, and it aims for fairly typical ground. If that is your cup of tea, more power to you. But at the end I found it to be actually unexceptional genre territory that does not offend audience sensibilities ala Saw, but does not swing for the fence either as a clever Bmovie. Roth also has the temerity to end the movie on a true note of whatthehell as the Santa Claus bearded convenience store clerk from earlier in the film serves a bunch of black people. It could work if he followed up on it with something better, or if he dropped it altogether. Same could be said for a lot of the movie.

A group of college teens after finals in the fall? goes to a resort cabin in the woods where one by one they are attacked by an unseen flesh eating virus.Unfortunately, the first paragraph is where any remote elements of film quality stop. Cabin Fever is little more than college kids looking for sex, booze, talking nonstop about nothing, and seeing how many Fbombs they can get into 140 minutes or however long this mess is.The kids act and react stupidly to everything around them. One of them for instance discovers that the skin virus has infected her legs, so what does she do? She keeps shaving her legs failing to take proper medical attention for her wounds. The scene is little more than a gross out. In another scene, Rider Strong from Boy Meets World gets bitten on the hand by some kid who only says Pancakes and likes to do karate kicks on those who sit next to him. If you can figure out the reason for why the Pancakes kid was included, I would love to know. Anyway, Rider pets a wild dog and goes off to wash his bitten hand in a most likely contaminated creek. Another kid likes to drop Fbombs in reacting to everything around him and shoot squirrels. Why? Your guess is as good as mine!Rider Strong is the ONLY kid with any recognition in this movie. He tries to calm people down inbetween the yelling and screaming and F Y! bombs that people are throwing around. When the kids are not yelling, they are having or talking about sex or talking nonsense to the other adult characters who are EVEN MORE if that is possibleidiotic than the kids! The idiot cop with an IQ of 60 at best may be one of the WORST acting jobs I have ever seen in a movie. You talk about people not playing with a full deck, this dork does not even know how to find the cards! LOL! I was like, Will you PLEASE shut up already?! He makes the kid actors look like geniuses! The only part that I sort of liked was Riders scary story although gory about the deranged bowling alley guy. In interviews, Rider said that he had a great deal of respect for director Eli Roth. But the problem is that Mr. Roth appears to be going for little more than shock and gore. There are far too many bad things about this movie for Mr. Roth to get any credit. I wish I could agree with Rider and find something likable about this movie. Maybe the fall scenery in the beginning? Actually, Rider Strong JUST saves this movie from being a 1!

When would hospitals ever through out such people for lack of a cure?

WRONG! He should watch and learn from better horrorcomedies such asFright Night, The Lost Boys and The Return Of the Living Dead! Those are funny!Cabin Fever is THE reason why I registered to www.IMDb.com so I can release my thoughts of discontent about it.I have decided to watch the movie a second time AAARGH! and make notes for my partial review to show how foolish the movie is. Resident Evil horror or Dude, Where is My Car? comedy I can watch over and over again and still enjoy! But this...!How bad can a script and a director be??? This bad. Here are the awful scenes in chronological orderIn the early scenes we see Henry, who does not realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and deadglazed stare is dead!The movie does not explain anything about the blonde longhaired kid who like to bite people.And my answer to Marcys unanswered question What is wrong with the woods? is nothing. The script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for suspense.Then the smartest of the 5pack, Bert, almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire. He meets nowinfected Henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the Fword. Bert starts to freak out because Henry looks awfully ill. BertDo not make me shoot you! he forgets to add ...with my BB gun!Bert heads back to the cabin but how about that? He meets Marcy and Jeff who were having sex, but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk! Marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire Bert had started earlier A moment of clarity for a change? Bert does not mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his BB gun.Later, as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire, another weirdo shows up with his dog. Maybe that is what the warning about the woods is all about? It is filled with weirdos...and their dogs!? They let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis. Their brains are completely intoxicated! No wonder why they are all so DUMB! This is the last time we will see this forgettable character...alive!Henry shows up at their cabin, NOTE He was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin!!! looking worse, almost like a zombie, covered in goo! He says he needs a doctor. But the Young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker. He gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition. Henry almost seems smart enough to drive the Hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard, seats and windows. The Fantastic Five come out running, armed with a BB Gun, a knife, a baseball bat huh? Ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods???, a poker, and a insecticide? spraycan, ready to combat the single, unarmed and terribly sick man. clever script! Bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his BB Gun, which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth. What else am I supposed to do? Bert yells in his defense. Jeff and Paul try to knock Henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the trucks windows instead. Henry walks up to the dumb girls who say He is coming towards us! Thanks for the info, dumb broads, I can see that! But I do not think he wants to do you any harm! Marcy sprays in his eyes, making Henry yelp! And our hero Paul touches Henrys arm with a burning log from the campfire, which they recklessly left burning while they were INSIDE the cabin! Where has all that wisdom gone? I guess the cannabis had started to take its toll! Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away, screaming.The following day, Bert and Jeff head out for a mechanic. And Marcy decides to go for help all by herself, in the woods, as Paul stays behind with Karen...Does not that sound idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already going for help!I skip my comments now to how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE rowing over a huge and winding river! How did she get a canoe? Does she even know where she is going!? Anyway, she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and, like in most horror movies, walks inside the cabin sayingHello? Is anyone there? Bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her and me at first. And along comes Jeff, as well. How did THEY get here!? Did they swim across the river??? Do you see how brainless the script is!?Deputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin. He somehow does not notice the blood on their truck. This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the DVD out.

My question to the filmmakers what was the point of the ending with the Black kids? Was that to force me to forget about the initial racist comment made earlier? To smooth things over with Black viewers, by making a joke out of it? Well, I for one, did NOT find that pathetic attempt at humor funny in the least bit.

But as far as I know, it is much closer to being a joke than anything else. A few years ago, the community of horror film makers decided to take a new step and make fun of the genre, thus giving birth to the Scream series. A list was given in Scream, of all the stupid things horror film characters will do that are predictable, and the characters in Scream ended up doing exactly the same things, which added a lot of humor and irony to this analysis of the genre, and led to hope that horror films from now on would show a bit different, either full of irony towards the genre, selfderision towards the film itself, or at least different in their dramatic process than all the old films that responded to the same tired criteria. In seeing Cabin Fever, alas, many will see how unoriginal, serious, pretentious, boring and even not scary some supposedly scary films are now, even a few years later. First of all, this film lacks originality in a way few others do. It has been said several times, how little imagination horror directors have today, remaking remakes of foreign sequels, but setting the film in a cabin in the woods just does not seem to be an hommage to anything, it seems to be, simply, a ripoff. Whoever wishes to be surprised by other factors of the films story will not be once again, we are dealing with a film whose characters are all in their early twenties, who will not think rationally when placed in front of a problem, will rather argue for hours and pick up fights than try to think and do something about it. Not much excitement there either. For the umpteenth time in a horror film, they are tempted to kiss, make love and just basically have fun, all sorts of things that do not really make them any different than any other horror film victims seen previously. Secondly, this film is unimaginatively serious. Every situation the characters are in, every dialog, every situation in the film is treated with such seriousness that any viewer with a little sense of derision will be relieved when some characters finally end up dying. Nothing in the way the film is directed, written or acted shows any sign of humor or sarcasm, which is quite amazing considering the film is about an invisibleneverheardofbeforeflesheatingvirus no laughs please. I will not even bring up the acting, since there are no actors in this film. The cast was most certainly hired for being friends or neighbors with the director. Thirdly, and this will strike whoever has seen a good horror film before, the screenplay is absolutely empty. Nothing really happens, some actions are repeated several times let us try to get help!, nothing makes sense, either in the facts, the psychology of the characters, or even the hilariously lame last sequence of the film, which is probably supposed to be funny according to the director and screenwriters. In the end I will only remark that a horror film is supposed to have something scary in it. Gallons of fake blood, whether they are being vomited, squirted from severed limbs or simply dripping from wounds, never were enough to scare an audience. Such major features as screenplay, ideas, and even cruelty are requested for whoever claims to have shot something scary. If I was not considering it to be a total failure, I would agree to reckon that the film has one talent it is filthy disgusting to watch. Yet being grossedout and being scared are two very different feelings, let it be known.I would like to encourage anyone a tad curious or interested in seeing this film to check older major horror films first, why not from the 60s, the 70s, the 80s, films made by Wes Craven, Dario Argento, Sam Raimi, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, Roger Corman, William Lustig, John Carpenter... it might not only give a good definition of what is scary, or selfderisory horror, but also convince viewers that new is not necessarily better. A good example related to the film is the few tracks composer Angelo Badalamenti provided for this film, even although they are unmistakably close to his previous compositions, they are below anything he has ever done before.","label":0},{"index":9514,"txt":"I wasted 5.75 to see this crappy movie so I just want to know a few thingsWhat was the point of the dog being split in half at the beginning of the movie, the disease had nothing to do with being split in half.What was the point of dragging Karen into the shed, she already totally infected her room, they could have just locked her in there where she would have been safer.Why would the Hermit be running around the forest asking strangers to help him when he could have just asked his relative, the hog lady, to take him to the hospital?Why did not any of the characters bother to walk into town to get help when things started getting bad, are they all really that lazy?Even if Paul was threatened by the guy w the shotgun for peeping on his wife, Paul could have just sent Jeff or Bert back to the house to ask for help. the girl he loves is deteriorating.What was the point of the box?Why did Jeff go back to the cabin after he left when everyone else was getting infected, if he was that big of a jerk to leave in the first place would not he have just gone back home?If the police went to all the trouble of gathering up the kids and burning them on the fire pit, why did they throw Paul halfway into the river, it was not even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminated.Who makes lemonade out of river water, that crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it.

Well, take that analogy a step further with this irredeemable gutter trash and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth extracted without novacaine. Do that, and you will have a general idea of what Eli Roths Cabin Fever is all about.I never believed any one film was capable of topping the sheer agonizing dreck that Uwe Boll cranks out as the worst film ever made. But, in all honesty, I have to say Cabin Fever comes very close. This is yet another sad excuse for a motion picture that had absolutely no valid reason to meet with any form of theatrical release. For somebody who claims to love the horror genre as much as Eli Roth does, he has created the single most annoying and convoluted patchwork of a movie I think I have ever seen in my entire life. How do you screw up a story like this? Think of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written characters, without the bad writing, and without all that unnecessary and unfunny comedy. A movie dealing with a grotesque flesheating virus could and should have been so much better than what Roth dished out for us here. This script failed on so many levels with me. And, while I do not doubt the evident talent this director possesses, I do know that he fumbled the ball big time on an idea that could very well have redefined the horror genre.To say this was a production of missed opportunities would indeed be a gross play on words. A generous amount of blood and unsettling special effects cannot even save it, and that is one element I normally go for. There really was nothing about Cabin Fever that I could easily recommend to anybody. When three quarters of the crowd walks out of the theater halfway through, you know the movie is sinking fast. My best advice to those reading this would be to simply rent before purchasing. One viewing was more than enough for me to know that I will most likely never bother with it again.","label":0},{"index":9516,"txt":"OK let us get right to the point.

I am not.When looked at by a purely objective observer, the film is an unbalanced narrative that presents us with more undistilled neuroses than are capable of being absorbed in one sitting. It is quite difficult to watch. The Brooks character Robert Cole is so unsympathetic and unpleasant that it is hard to relate to himlet alone root for him as he stumbles from one dysfunctional selfabsorbed situation to the next. And he should NEVER do a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context. No man could have that much exposed foliage and be supposed to turn on a babe like Kathryn Harroldunless, of course, he is Albert Brooks in an Albert Brookscontrolled production.Modern Romance has its amusing momentsbut they are fragmentary and infrequent. More often than not, I felt as if I were on a confined journey with a thoroughly dislikable person and wishing that it would end already. It confirms the problems that can develop when too much control of a film is placed in only one personsomeone who lacks the selfdiscipline to be able to step back from it and see what is clearly happening.As most people probably know, James L. Brooks, who played the director in this film, is in fact what he portrayed. Six years later, he cast Albert Brooks in the very successful Broadcast News. James showed us how Albert can shape a credible and entertaining comic performance. Albert allowed us to see James generally not cast as an actor do a rare comic turn in a surprisingly effective manner.Fans of Modern Romance will by now have moved on to the next laudatory comment about it. To you I saythere is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a film intended as an entertainment.","label":0},{"index":9519,"txt":"This is a depressingly shallow, naive and mostly unfunny look at a wildly improbable relationship between Brooks psychotic film editor and Harold, his vapid girlfriend. The two have ZERO chemistry together  primarily because Harold is incapable of doing anything besides looking pretty at this stage of her career; but also because Brooks character is neither interesting nor likeable. There are 15 static, excruciating minutes at the beginning where Brooks, having just broke up with Harold, stumbles about his apartment in a depressed, drugged out state  unbearable.Sappily and unimaginatively bookended by Joe Cockers You Are So Beautiful, there simply is not enough material here for a feature film. There is hardly anything going on on the periphery of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world. I am sure Brooks intention was to shine a white hot spotlight on the affair and, in a way, deconstruct it; but if you are going to do that the writing and acting needs to be far far better than what it is here.","label":0},{"index":9520,"txt":"when you get to the scenes that involve Albert Brooks without his shirt... try not to gag on a fur ball.I like Albert Brooks. I have seen most, if not all of his movies but it was the first time seeing this one. Modern Romance is an interesting take on the subject of love. There are few movies that handle the desperation of love as well or as overtly as Modern Romance, although 1979s Chilly Scenes of Winter comes very close. They both essentially deal with obsessed men that are too psychologically attractedobsessed to their respective women.Whereas Chilly Scenes of Winter borders on the subject stalking, this movie has a more grounded foundation with the subject of love because both people are already in a relationship.. and out of the relationship.. and back in it again.And because it is a movie that was released in 1981, it is of its time in terms of styles and such. That is the main reason I like this movie. My basic rule when it comes to movies is If it sucks at least it may have some historic relevance, you know time capsule stuff.Which leads me to the horrific scenes of Albert Brooks sans shirt.The man is hair. Very hair. Like he is wearing a black curly fur sweaterhairy. And what is worse is he almost looks burn victimhairy. It is not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him without a shirt go on and on. Back in the early 80s hairy men were seen as normal and nothing shocking. But in 2009 the sight of something like this is just plain revolting. Sorry, Albert! I wish at some point someone said hey let us try this scene but with you wearing a simple tshirt, I mean you might scare people. It is just really bad and I feel sorry for the poor pretty actress that had to deal with Albert Brooks naked body on top of hers. She was probably pulling out his hairs from her teeth for days after that.Anyway, it is an OK movie. It could have been better if I had not see Albert Brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 long continuous minutes because that will forever taint my viewing of this movie.","label":0},{"index":9521,"txt":"Mike HawthorneGordon Currieis witness to the brutal murder of his mother and suicide of his father MortyJon Fedele.

This dull suspense film is a fragmented mess, attempting at once to be a stalker thriller, a murder thriller, a tale of loyalty and betrayal, and a steamy erotic thriller. The film, my friends, is not thrilling in the slightest.For instance, who thought of casting C. Thomas Howell as a desirable leading man? He is not ugly, but for crying out loud, it looks as though Fiorentinos toughcookie goddess is getting it on with a kindergarten teacher. Howell has neither the authority or screen presence to fill the leading man role.The script is by far the worst aspect of the film. There is no tension as Fiorentinos character gets eerie phone calls, there is no mystery concerning her guilt in the murders that are the focus of the film, there is no sense of liberation as Fiorentino gets wimpy Howell to lose his inhibitions.Look for interesting but poorlydone cameos by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes, and one really, really good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino.

The plot was nonexistent, the cinematography was hopeless and the acting was on par with an alevel performance. It was unfortunately long and the subplots were incredibly unrealistic....for example....if your best friend slept with your exboyfriend of 6 years after only 2 weeks of being broken up you would not all remain the best of friends.

Writers using characters as mouthpieces to speak for themselves. Predictable, plodding plot points say that five times fast. A childs imitation of Britney Spears. This film has all the earmarks of a Lifetime Special reject.I honestly believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo set out to create a thoughtprovoking, emotional film on a tough subject, exploring the idea that things are not always black and white, that one who is a criminal by definition is not necessarily a bad human being, and that there can be extenuating circumstances, especially when one puts the wellbeing of a child first. However, their earnestness ends up being channeled into preachy dialogue and trite situations planted to move the plot along. The decent production values and interesting use of documentarystyle camera footage are not enough to accomplish their aim when the script and the acting fall flat.Logic is often compromised for the sake of creating tension Soid first tries to blackmail Pablo into participating in her documentary in exchange for helping them escape, then in the same breath basically tells him not to trust her because she is not helping them out of altruism. Well, duh. And for a man on the run, Pablo is far too swayed by a temper tantrum. Cristinas wellbeing is so important to him that he is fleeing capture and jail or deportation for her, but he is willing to risk all that to appease her when she does not want to go to Mexico. Right. Talk above overpermissive parenting. Third, when Pablos employer Charlie gives the phone to Detective Bright, she is remarkably unprofessional, especially given her seniority  did she really think she was persuasive? Oh, yeah, I would have turned myself in. CCH Pounders Detective Wims could wipe the floor with her.To be fair, I would like to list the things I liked. Um, I liked the midget. And I liked the fact that the midget was named Sexy. There is crossdressing, always a plus; juvenile crossdressing, no less! Harry is infinitely cuter than Cristina. But my favorite moment in the film has to be when Cristina kicks Detective NotSoBright. I also find it interesting that, in a heavily minority cast which I much appreciate, by the way, the black character is the racist one. Too bad it is just thrown out there and not further explored.There is a distinctive, unconventional score, but it is nonetheless generally contextunspecific, not enhancing mood or tension in any scene, except the pathetic, anguished wailing every time the main character is in anguish, as though they think his acting does not show it enough Just in case you were not sure, he is upset, and we have the musical cues to prove it.Stilted, clich\u00e9d dialogue results in a depressing lack of subtext; everything has to be spelled out in dialogue, even when the body language had been up til then conveying it just fine. For example, every impassioned speech Pablo makes, and Mrs. Knights lament that her child will not be crawling into bed with them in the morning.Papi, tell me about Mama again  what shameless, blatant exposition introducing the generic dead wife! She is always the most beautiful woman the widower had ever seen, the kindest he had ever met. Why cannot we see a man cry over a woman like Shakespeares  she may be fat, ugly, obnoxious, but his love for her is deep as oceans? Now _there is_ a story which would move me.The police always being literally one step behind them gives many scenes the outofplace feeling of a French farce. Most boring foot chases ever  Bright and Lightning are so outofshape and easilyfooled he certainly is not quick as lightning, and she, well, I do not feel the need to spell things out. Some guy dragging along a small child outrunning a bicycle cop, complete with macho biker picking a fight but then being felled by a child? To quote Margaret Cho, that is so sad. Would we ever see this on Cops ?Hackneyed and overthetop deus ex machina as an employer, would you really waive checking his green card just because he can quote the author of the inspirational saying on a poster behind your desk?Plus several scenes, including the above, threaten to devolve into porn Well, I will do this favor for you, as long as you do something for me... I can almost hear the bowmchickabowmbowm.When the parents view the footage shot of Pablos remorse, the grieving moms freakout is the most real the movie feels. Unfortunately, this is diminished by the fact that she looks completely swayed by his emotional speech right up until she goes ballistic. A more ambivalent look would be more convincing here.I am in constant awe of the stupidity of the main character doing things for the sake of plot holding up a convenience store without a mask, visiting the dead girls grave. And why does not the mother recognize his face from when she saw him before he drove off?! You seem awfully familiar...What is the purpose of that wholly unnecessary, somewhat gratuitous scene with Soid and the artificiallyenhanced bartender? Character development? Tch. Too little, too late.Speaking of unnecessary traits that never went anywhere, Detective Lightnings saying skeptical Detective Bright must be a Scorpio shows how little he really knows about the occult. And I do not think that believing in fate quite qualifies as voodoo mumbo jumbo.At the end, when Bright holds Pablo as he dies  wait, why does she care now? Her character is as inconsistent as Soids. What, she has to shoot him just because she said Stop, or I will shoot? She is cared _so_much_ about her integrity thus far. He was unarmed. There was no need for lethal force. What is wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize him?Finally, Cristinas childlike acceptance of her mothers death giving Dr. Knight peace over his daughters death  so forced. And the contrivance of the family whose child was killed becoming Cristinas new family... It angers me that she could be a replacement for their little girl. It is also unrealistic that a white couple would take in the Latino daughter of the man who killed their own daughter. I am not saying there are not generous, loving people who would do that. I am just saying that the characters here are never developed far enough for me to believe that _they_ would do that.I find it offensive that another IMDb reviewer said that of course as a woman she was moved by the sappy scenes. I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that do not wax sentimental in a manufactured manner.Cowriter, codirector, costar Nebot said himself he wore too many hats during this production. Too many cooks may spoil the broth, but one cook alone just might end up making an afterschool special.In conclusion, this films title has less to do with the story and more to do with the feeling of regret, helplessness, and loss accompanying the revelation that you will never see your money again.","label":0},{"index":9530,"txt":"I see a lot of people liked this movie. To me this was a movie made right of writing 101 and the person failed the class. From the time Lindsey Price the videographer shows up until the end the movie was very predictable.

Clich\u00e9 1 moviesTV always kill off the the mother parent if the child is a girl, or a brood of boys so the single father can get swoon over his dead wife and seem completely out of his element taking care of the children. Starting from from My 3 Sons to 2 12 Dads. These movies are usually dramas and comedies are TV shows.Clich\u00e9  2 When a pushy woman has a video camera in her hand she will play a big part in the movie. And will always have solutions or even if that person is a airhead Clich\u00e9 3 If the person in peril is a foreigner they have to be of Latino origin. And they must be illegal. Apparently there are no legal Latinos and illegal Europeans, unless if there is a IRA element involved.Clich\u00e9 4 The said Latino must be highly educated in his native country. In this case he was a Profesor who made 200 per month. And the said highly educated Latino must now act like he has not brain in his head now and lets the air head side kick take over.Clich\u00e9 5 The crime the person committed really was not a crime but a accident. But because in this case he has lost all of the sense he had when he crossed the boarder he now acts like a blithering idiot and now has put his own daughter in peril by taking her along on a fruitless quest to the border with the idiot side kick.Clich\u00e9 6 One never runs over a hoodlum running from a crime , but some poor little cute kid. This is because the parents of the child have to play a big part of the movie, and because the the person who accidentally killed the child can have ridiculous interaction with the parents.Clich\u00e9 7 Name me one movie in which one cop is not the angry vet and they get paired up with a rookie. Even if they are homicide detectives who have to be the most experienced cops on a police Force. Sev7n and Copy cat and Law and Order come to mind right away. And the vet even though gruff on the outside has a heart of gold.Clich\u00e9 8 Let us go and round up some unemployed Soap Stars. Now I like Lindsey Price. But Susan Haskell IMO can not act her way out of a paper bag and when she use to be on One Life To Live as Marty he swayed from right to left every time she opened her mouth. It use to get me sea sick. She might be anchored on land better now, but she still cannot act.The movie might have been more insightful if it was not filled with clich\u00e9s. I do not think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good. But this was just bad.SPOILER Now I am not going to spoil the ending. Oh heck I will because I feel it will be a disservice to humanity to let a person waste time they will never get back looking at this movie. It involves Clich\u00e9 6 and 7. Unless a person has never seen a movie before you had to see what was coming. The father makes even a dumber mistake runs from the cops at the end and gets shot by the angry veteran, who all of a sudden is very upset. You would think she thought the poor guy was innocent all through the movie and she shot him by mistake. When she did not. Now for the little girl who the dad brought along with him. Guess what happen to her? Times up, she ends up living with the family whose child was killed by her father!! Come on! You all knew that was going to happen, because she is a replacement child!! That is why she did not go and live with the Lindey Price character. This movie was a insult as far as I was concerned. Because there were so many avenues this movie could of explored and went down but it chose to take the clich\u00e9 ridden one.

Shoddily written characters who exhibit no motive for their behaviors compromise the quality of acting all around. Lack of character depth especially diminishes Selma Blairs performance, whose character Shawn vacillates from being morose to acting cool and ultimately comes across as a confused dolt. This is unfortunate, as under other circumstances Ms. Blair is an appealing and capable actress.Compounding matters for the worse is director Dana Lustigs insistence on using rapid cuts, incongruous special effects e.g. look for an unintentionally hilarious infrared motorcycle chase at the end, and a hip soundtrack in the hopes of appealing to the short attention spans of the MTV crowd. Certainly Ms. Lustig proves that she is able to master the technical side of direction, but in no way does her skill help overcome the films inherent problems and thus the movie drags on to the end. Clearly, Lustig has a distinct visual style; however it is perhaps better suited to music videos than to feature film.The producers Ram Bergman  Lustigcan be commended for their ability to realize this film they were able to scare up 1.5 million to finance the film, secure a good cast, and get domestic and foreign distribution.

But the story line with the detective who is sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just plain terrible.

Gave me the impression that the story had originally been meant as a short 2030 minutes, and then stretched into a feature as a labour of love between director Grieve and star Zelniker they cowrote the screenplay.It might have been more entertaining if any of the characters had anything to say that I had not heard said in many other films before, or if the ending was not  disappointingly  the one I had predicted three minutes into the film atypical for an independentsmaller studio film.

Widdoes is a very mannered Beatrice giving a particularly poor performance. Waterston, a fine actor, is not much better as Benedict.The poorest performance is in the role of Don John  it makes Keanu Reeves look good. Perhaps the desire to make it a caricature along the lines of the villain who ties the maiden to the train track fits with the keystone kops capers of Dogberry and his men  but the acting makes you want to cringe.Successful setups include the scene where they fool Benedict into believing Beatrice loves him  were the acting competent it would be superb.

It sort of follows a similar plot, but it is impossible to connect to the original, with the exception of the presence of Morty, the mannequin monster made of wood. Here is a brief overview.Twenty years after Mike Hawthorne Gordon Currie, in a decent performance witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life, Mike is still suffering from the fear of that day. In hopes of ridding his fear, Mike takes his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his grandparents home. His plan is for everyone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears, and then present the fears to the mannequin Morty. According to an Indian friend, this process is supposed to magically take away ones fear. What Mike does not know is that Morty is possessed with his fathers spirit, and begins killing off the friends...or is it really Mike himself doing the killings? Who cares?A have a few troubles with this film. The first lies with Morty. I thought the original made Morty look rather convincing. This time, it is painfully obvious Morty is a man actor Jon Fedele in a fake looking suit. This can especially be seen in early scenes, where Morty is still supposed to be inanimate, but if you watch closely you can see him blinking. Another trouble is that most of the characters do not try hard enough. Some of them do, namely Betsy Palmer, of Friday the 13th fame, who was excellent in this film. But most of them do not make the effort or were not given the chance. Finally, there are the killings. The opening scenes involving ax murders were very convincing. Actually, when I saw them I thought I was in for a good movie. When the second half of the movie arrives, and the killings really start, everything falls to pieces. Deaths are either uncreative, unseen, or foreseen glimpses of the next scene as Currie has a blackout. One character dies in the end and no one, including the viewer, even notices. While more characterization was needed in the beginning half, it was not too bad. The second half was. I think new director Chris Angel got to this point and really did not know how to shoot the violent scenes, so they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian. A silly ending does not help either. Thus, unless you really loved the original and enjoy plucking splinters out from under your skin, you should probably skip The Fear 2 Halloween Night.

But her past returns to haunt her as Chi Lam is kidnapped for the ransom of security software belonging to the company Cat works for. In order to rescue him, she calls on her old friends from her orphanage days, six other feisty women, to save the day...I may have told the synopsis cheesily, but this is a cheesy story. In fact, the whole script and direction lacked any quality at all. Much of the dialogue was meaningless and coupled with a plot that was as thin as ricepaper in water. If I could sum it up, take a bad Jackie Chan movie, remove the comedy, remove the choreography, throw away the budget, and you have Martial Angels a formulaic piece of work with no imagination at all.Mind you, I do have to give credit where credit is due, and Shu Qi was probably the only person to emerge unscathed from the terrible action, as it was her performance that shone through. Okay, you cannot say she was excellent  after all she had absolutely nothing to work with  but she did manage to dig some character out from her role. Other than that, only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin made any other impression  although these were mostly glimmers and very brief.Elsewhere, the film just fell to pieces. Scenes and dialogue were completely unnatural and unbelievable, special effects were obviously done on the cheap with no attempt to clean up edges between persons and the mask of the blue screen, poor editing involving numerous discontinuities in fight scenes, camera angles that were elementary and unflattering, and direction I have seen better from a lost dog.I guess this film was a too many cooks affair.

She has even started up a friendship with her attractive, slightly younger perhaps, landscape architect  gardener who is black. But then horror of middleaged womens horrors, ANOTHER 20 something female she took on as a tenant to let a room to, starts taking over her life.What this new younger woman threat really does is mildly flirt with the gardener, and offer him a glass of wine that  gasp  really belonged to the divorcee!! She runs up the utility bills by not turning down the thermostat!! And backed up the toilet! And leaves old food gone bad in the refrigerator! And hangs her pieces of African artwork in the living room!! And so on. Well she may have killed the cat as well. Yeah, ok, the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough, but its more than a little ridiculous, especially as it turns into a campaign. The character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular prissy woman insane. So why did she rent the room  and to horror of horrors, a much younger woman?Supposedly this increasingly arrogant natch younger woman has a mania for seizing control. And our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil and erotically hot looking, of course 20 something. But there is this problem. Anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her POWER  and just flirts or has sex with some guy, and escapes the consequences. Well, there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings. It just is not  generally  used in quite this sort of way.The premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her. Of course the 40 something does not know about these things, and the 20 something has had help. The lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period, with utilities thrown in at the fixed price. Even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending, the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman, supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something. You know, the judge is sympathetic to all the woeisme of the sexy sweet young thing. Finally the 40 somethings heroic battle back for THE HOUSE then begins. Woopie!!The only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy TROs or orders of protection are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so  although they are generally only this easy against men. They are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here. Indeed, girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever, but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats, and sometimes without even hearing his side. Even when there is a hearing, it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats to prove a negative, when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused, rather than the accuser. This is one of the only areas of American law where that is true  and it is a signal outrage of feminist overreaching, and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller. Of course that is not likely to be the subject of any Lifetime movie in this lifetime.The absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic, and is not taking her medicine. Even so it makes no sense. She is not after the successful lawyer exhusband, though she does con his help to the ex wifes fury in her quest. She is after THE HOUSE technically, to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease. This second younger woman is after ALL That is LEFT after the divorce, after affairs with other 20 somethings STOLE her husband!! The exhusband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling  does not matter, he still strayed!!!The protagonist is good enough looking for her age.

There she climbs the stairs with a knife, demonicly stalking her nemesis 40 something, who is taking a bath by candlelight, secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life. There is a struggle  and the 40 something mom wins  by sticking the 20 something with a hypodermic needle full of antipsychotic medicine she had found.

Morty, a lifesize wooden doll kept in the attic by the Indian handyman, becomes possessed by the dead fathers spirit and kills them off using their phobias. Characters are thrown out a window, drowned in a toilet, eaten by rats, blown up, etc. Morty morphs into the dad and a tree, walks around and makes stupid wisecracks. After finding a girl chopped up and stuffed in a cardboard box, the characters remain in the house, act cheerful, crack jokes and have sex.The Morty design is good and Betsy Palmer Mrs. Voorhees from the original Friday THE 13TH is surprisingly delightful as the grandmother, but this thing is even more senseless and confusing than the original and is full of false scares, bad acting, braindead characters, repeat flashback footage and annoying distorted camerawork.

It is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the lethal virus. However, the head honcho who decides to remove it from a bank security deposit box, does so at the same time a bank heist is going down, at the same FBI agents have been informed of this, and at the same time a terrible earthquake erupts. Needless to say, the aftermath of the quake is messy in more ways than one. However, the results do not make for an enticing action film, but instead, one that has been obviously zgrade junk from the beginning of the film. Perhaps this is why some of the screen captures on the packaging look to be created with computer graphics rather than being actual screen captures from various sequences of the film.

He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear, and together with his Indian friend Crow Byron Chief Moon, they would perform an ancient Indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy Morty Jon Fedele that would eliminate their fears forever. The greatest fear of Michael is to become a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong and Morty turns into his father, killing his friends.The Fear Resurrection is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows, but in a messy screenplay full of clich\u00e9s. There are some exaggerated performances, like for example Ms. Betsy Palmer; others very weak, but in general the acting is good. Unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live; further, in spite of being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies.

What I also do not get is, if they had to dub SOME of his lines, why does his own voice appear on the rest of them? I expect Seagal to age like the rest of us. But the Seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger, confidence, bravado, charm, and sexappeal he so easily showed us in ALL of his previous movies. What I found myself missing most of all was his cocky, selfassured attitude and his badass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin.

In the end the story itself did not deliver what it promised, but I actually thought that the acting, characterization if I may use such a big word and the rest of the production values delivered exactly what a true Steven Seagal fan would expect.

It is painfully obvious that this movie was supposed to have a different storyline. That results in woeful voiceovers in which Steves voice does not nearly sync up with that of the dubbed voice.

A mishmash of plot lines, a choppy mess, and a horribly stagnated pace, make the film hard to watch start to finish. I managed this and I am proud. As a fan of Seagals work mostly of his old days, it is painful to see him star in such tripe. True Seagals last half dozen movies or so, have sucked a lot, but some of them at least had some redeeming features. Attack Force is a mess. From conception to delivery this film has undergone many changes, from an alien plot line, to the current one about a highly addictive super drug, about to be unleashed on the Romanian the film has several settings, none of which are Romanian, but all look like Romania because they are in Romania! populace. The film is tacked together with little regard for whatever state the original shooting script was. Plotholes and loose ends are abound in the film that is for sure. That is been a problem in Seagals last few films as well, but never has the result been so boring. There is a whole plot line about the water supply being poisoned with CTX that is the drugs cool name that is never resolved! Of course in recent years the plots have not been the main draw in the Seagal canon so there was a big onus on the other departments, especially the action. Before I regard the action though, all the other departments are poor. The direction is poor, or perhaps better put, made to look poor. Who knows how director Michael Keusch originally intended this film? Between him finishing his job, the reshoots by stunt man Tom Delmar, and the editing, a coherent auteur vision is completely lost. The best way to describe the film is that it is just all over the shop! The cinematography is dull, nearly inducing sleep, while the droning score sounding like it was produced on the cheapest of cheap synthesizers does nothing to excite matters. The cast too are poor, unable to salvage anything here. Seagal looks bored beyond recognition, and is dubbed through much of the picture, clearly when plotpoints are being changed. He looks tired and overweight, and lethargic, unlike he is looked in previous pictures too remarkable as the aforementioned have been key complaints in Seagals recent pictures. The only redeemable cast member is Adam Croasdell as one of the villains, doing a slimy Brit routine. He seems to be a throwback to the alien plot line, because he is playing it inhuman. He seems like a cross between a body snatcher and a vampire ditto to the lead villain played by some hot chick who appears on occasion, seemingly waiting for her husband\u0085 Dracula.Finally the action. Well it is poor. Poorly conceived, poorly shot. There is not much either, and there is even less featuring Seagal. Stevo does not really bring out the stunt double here, because there is so little to do. There is even a lengthy repetitive and boring action scene on the hour mark that intercuts occasionally with little flashes of Seagals stand in because clearly Seagal was not there while the scene was being shot, and they wanted to have him feature in the action scene. Seagal eventually appears in person to shoot two guys in the head. Seagal has a producers credit here and a script credit, but from what I understand the film has been altered behind his back to the current state it is in. Seagal will apparently not be working with these people again, or with Castel Studios who continue to deliver horrifically subNuImage that is saying something, material.Overall this is one to avoid if you are not a Seagal fan. Seagal fans can also be safe in the knowledge that the big man probably will not want to do anything this bad again. Unfortunately his next film which has already been shot, with the same people, promises to be even worse than this.

My doubt is if this is the work of a regular guy who happens to love films or if this is the work of a cinema student, since there is a reference to Oporto School of Arts in the final credits.Nevertheless, director Ricardo Pinho demonstrates with this movie a total unawareness of some basic notions about cinema. What is a movie? How to tell a story? It does not matter, for the novice director. One of the first things you learn in school when you are studying cinema is how to tell a story. You learn that, just like in novels, in movies you should also construct your story in three acts the introduction, the development and the conclusion. You learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax. You learn this is valid for a 3hourepic, for the regular movie, for a short film and even, believe it or not, for a 30second commercial. You also learn there can be levels of subtleness in your approach to the academic structure and that, ultimately, you can even deconstruct it.In rough terms, TIM WATCHER introduces us its main character and then, the movie ends  the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in Jeunets AM\u00c9LIE. There are no second or third acts in TIM WATCHER. This is not a parody or an art film, thus you cannot even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure. You are expecting to be told a story, and it does not happen. Worst than that, TIM WATCHER defines itself as a warning; and one with no real purpose. It does not make a point, or at least, not a valid one. Its point is childish, with a sense of vengeance. The situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is Manichaean.I was expecting a lot more from this short. The movie opens with a rather goodlooking credits sequence and you quickly realize you are watching something with better production values than the regular Portuguese short film. I do not know the budget for this movie, but judging for the thankslist in the end credits, merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country where is difficult to have doors opened to young filmmakers.TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in style, color and carefully chosen plans, combined with a fine score. That is all. There is nothing else. There is no plot. And that is a shame because it feels like a waste of production values. Hardly, you can see in the regular Portuguese short such diversity of locations and so many available extras to enrich a story.As absurd as the comparison may sound, I must refer the BMW shorts as a fine example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely conditioned to product placement and overthetop stylish cinematography.","label":0},{"index":9605,"txt":"Unfortunately I have to agree with the critic written by halopes.For a short film the cinematography, costumes, sets, sound, editing and everything else is very, very good. This might seem surprising at first but I was told that the technical crew working on this consisted of professionals, so the quality is to be expected. The problem, as usual, resides in the story itself.Thing is, it is not really a story. To tell a story or in cinemas case, SHOW a story you need plot and conflict. You need things that happen to the protagonist events. These events happen because the protagonist wants something and, for some reason, he cannot get it. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. He is a kind of supernatural entity who observes mankind. That is it. So what we have here is pure exposition. Instead of being shown a story, we are simply learning things about this Tim Watcher individual. Of course, considering the peculiar nature of Tim Watcher and the films short duration, it is hard to give enough background about him so the movie resorts to VoiceOver Narration. In this case it is used in the worst possible sense which is to give information that otherwise we would never glean. In fact, if it was not for the VO we would think the character was just a kooky old man going around looking at things. To make it worse the VO also explains what is happening on the screen! The images we are shown are just decoration for the text we are listening to.I could say that this short film would make a good video for a band or something, but because the images do not stand on their own it is impossible to say that.

I have nothing against any of the actors and for their credit they do a good job but this show is flawed from the premise.We have a character who is unlikable. He is full of flaws, not enlightened, and a complete jerk on a good day. Yet the reason why anybody should care just is not there. While creating an American sitcom centered around a complete bullheaded jackass is revolutionary and full of potential, it just is not met here within this show. Most of the supporting characters are not fully fleshed characters but rather sad punching bags that want empathy from the audience for being punching bags. As in any sitcom, they are the ones who are made the most normal for the audience to relate to, and in doing this they negate the lead character to such an extent that we see Bittinger being himself and harming people and they just stay there because....why? There is no reason. Any normal people would have simply left the abuse. Keeping them there without any real reasoneven the really unbelievable one given by Joanna Cassidy in the very special 2part abortion episode that has major problems of its ownis where the show just falls apart. To simply believe that people put up with this guy because we are told he has a heart of gold does not mesh with the reality of the situation. If anything, this is not even dramedy. This is a badly plotted, conceived, and executed premise that had a few moments but overall met the fate it deserved. Someone had the guts to go out and make a very good idea, but the execution is so haphazard that it just looks like a weirdly scripted version of the Jerry Springer show where someone is abused by this tyrant that we are supposed to root for because we are told to. A show like this requires a deft touch that the actors here could have provided easily, but somehow are not able to. And that is a fatal error that really killed the program.Chalk it up to a show in its infancy. Regardless, the show is worth a watch. But it really screwed up when trying to aim for the stars, and made the whole enterprise not what it could have been.","label":0},{"index":9608,"txt":"Going down as the most expensive film in Finnish history, to date, Dark Floors is a horror film with an extremely Lynchian narrative that recounts an ever increasingly decrepit series of Floors ironically enough in an abandoned hospital, in which our protagonists are trapped. Lead by an autistic daughter and her father, himself disenchanted with the hospitals apparent lack of medical progress with his daughter, make their way into an elevator debating the issue with one of the hospitals nurses. Accompanied by a security guard, a businessman and a seemingly intoxicated tramp the collective soon find the complex abandoned, but they are not alone. Directed by Finnish born Pete Riski, more known for his television work, Dark Floors is filmed in English, using mainly English actors but has the notable inclusion of Finlands arguably most famous group Lordi 2006 Eurovision song contest winners as themselves, i.e. in their on stage monstrous costumes, as the films antagonists, yet for all this razzmatazz the production fails where it is needed most, in convincing the audience.Any film that has their lead character use the phrase it is too quiet is already headed down a dubious path, and this Lordi influenced horror does not break that convention. For all the good ideas that are thrown into the mix there are a handful of ripe clich\u00e9s alongside and worst of all, anything that is interestingly original is not fleshed out enough for it to resonate. The concept of the degrading floors is initially highly ominous and does provide a sense of inevitable doom as the audience is aware those trapped in the hospital must progress ever further down in the mire. However, there is not enough atmosphere created to scare and intimidate the audiences into the unknowing fear, the viewer is aware the journey will become ever more dangerous, as the levels degenerate from shiny white through to hellish black, but I do not think the characters are aware enough of this fact for it to be threatening. Also, the entire film taking place in what is essentially its own time bubble is again a very nice touch, a concept not often used in the horror genre, but the characters do not confront the situation with enough fear and trepidation when they stumble across this fact, they continue about their business far too readily and without enough genuine concern for the idea to mean anything to the audience. These initially good ideas are just left to go to waste, as if the director andor Mr Lordi who had many of the ideas used within the film had these thoughts, but could not agree or decide on how to best use them and as such lose their purpose and point. Yet for all the frustration there are large quantities of comedy, yet not for the reasons the creators would have hoped for. Too much is clich\u00e9d, too much is recycled and too much is just simply ridiculous. While the lead is amicably acted by Noah Huntley, the characters are mere cardboard cut outs that have been pasted into the story from other films. We have a lead man doing everything possible to protect his daughter alongside a clunkily developed love interest. Accompanying the couple we have the traditional token black man as a hardnosed security guard, with the nigh on infinite clip for his sidearm, and a weasely disbelieving businessman only on the look out for himself. Worst of all though, unfortunately, is the introduction of the cast of Lordi as the creatures of the night that torment our wandering band of misfits, but not for them appearing as themselves. What makes a horror film scary to the viewing audience is contextualising the fear. The Shining is scary because it is a member of your own family hounding you, in Dawn Of The Dead it is our fear of each other and the primordial cannibalism and irrational thought patterns the zombies possess, in Alien the fear is explained, the creature is rationalised and in Dark Floors there is none of that. Perhaps it is unfair to compare this production to these monoliths of the genre but when you do it shows it pales significantly and that it is aggressors feel like nothing more than demented Klingons where you can almost see the zip on the costumes they wear, without a build up of any atmosphere Lordi just are not scary.It is infuriating because we all cheer for the underdog and hope they do well, you want the smaller productions to say that they can create the same quality of film as Hollywood churns out, much in the similar way that George A Romero started out, but it does not always materialise. I enjoyed the film and did not feel as if I had wasted the ninety minutes I had just sat through, but I felt enjoyment on a completely hollow level as if nothing that had occurred mattered or affected me subconsciously, emotionally or critically. I felt the almost Lynchian narrative was a standout plus point, but it fades out into nothingness. Why did it happen? What does it mean? Will they go through this all again? Without even the slightest insight into what will happen the film is simply puzzling for the sake of trying to be arty. Was the entire sequence of events real or was it merely a dream sequence? Had the autistic girl watched the Eurovision Song Contest of 2006 and simply had a highly bizarre nightmare given the stress she was under? Who knows? And unfortunately I fail to work up the energy to even care. Dark Floors is an infuriating experience that while ultimately shallow hallmarks potential and at the very least shows a plethora of creative energies from Mr Lordi, who perhaps should look into working solo to fully develop his ideas. It is one that fans of the group or the genre should perhaps pursue but will leave you feeling left in the lurch for not having enough light shed on the situation.","label":0},{"index":9609,"txt":"Hines and Goforth, the perpetrators of this crime, begin on the wrong foot first step, by assuming that Wells wrote Gothic horror and that all of his lines are meant to be taken seriously. That simply is not true. Wells was very much an inheritor of the Enlightenment, and his main concern was that Victorian selfsatisfaction might leave the British unprepared for the world the new technology could produce  both the good and the bad.Two terrible consequences follow  the protagonist is portrayed as a wimpy screamer I was reminded of Fay Wray in the original King Kong, rather than a man struggling to live out the ironies of an unbelievable catastrophe; and the dialog reeks of Victorianisms uttered seriously that Welles clearly meant to be taken tongue in cheek.All of this looks suspiciously like Ed Wood with an enormous budget to waste on CGI effects  which by the way are so poorly accomplished, the Warner Bros. cartoon factory of the 1940s could have done a better job. Gobs of spattered blood looked like red balloons, I expected them to float away any minute. Think The Yellow Submarine as done by the old EC Comics.Worse yet is the loss of theme, which robs the film of any reason to exist. Although the makers of this film return the story to its Victorian era, they utterly miss the uncanny way Wells story predicted many of the horrors of the First World War  a fact not unnoticed by Wells himself, who, after the war, reworked the theme in The Shape of Things to Come.Without any theme, all we have here are a lot of people running around getting blasted into cartoon balloons, when they are not trying out for a high school production of a drunken students rewrite of Macbeth.Really, this is the worst, most senseless piece of drivel I have suffered through since a friend talked me into seeing the Eastern European cartoon Fantastic Planet thirty years ago. That film was so pretentiously dull, my friend and I and two total strangers gave up ridiculing it about halfway through, and sat near the screen playing cards, using the movie as light by which to see the cards  its only usefulness, as far as any of us could tell.But I already have electric lighting in my apartment, so I did not need this putdown of Wells for anything.Do not avoid this film  steal every copy you can do not pay a cent and burn each and every one of them.

In none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though.

As monsters are the true stars of horror, I could not wait to see what was lurking in the halls of the hospital the main characters had found themselves trapped in...And then the first monster showed up, and I found myself greatly underwhelmed. By the time the second appeared, I boggled at the fact it looked like it had just come from a Megadeth concert, and the silliness turned me off completely.Over the course of the movie the atmosphere did remain intact, and the story left you wondering just what was going on, but the scares were pretty much nonexistent. However, I held out hope that the end would make it all worthwhile. Unfortunately that was not to be the case. By the time the movie had reached it is climax, I was in utter disbelief, and I immediately recognized the big bad in his final reveal... The lead singer of Lordi? Seriously? Was that what the movie all boiled down to? A bunch of poor souls being chased around a hospital by Lordi band members? The silly monster design suddenly made sense. If you are going to be that corny, may as well through the members of Marilyn Manson, or even KISS in there too. Not to mention the fact that I am pretty sure I saw the ending in one of Lordis music videos a few years ago. They had to go and make an entire movie off of it? Worst of all, when I found out what really had been going on, all I could manage was a yawn. I am not going to ruin it for you, but I can safely say it is probably a plot device you have seen before. Most likely more then once.So, unless you are a huge Lordi fan, stay away from this. It is not scary, it does not bring anything new to the table although it does a decent job of borrowing from other horror movies, mainly Silent Hill. And, I cannot stress this enough, LORDI is the antagonist. LORDI. Talk about a buzzkill. Really, you would be better off trying to scare yourself watching Slipknot music videos. In other words, it is just not possible.","label":0},{"index":9616,"txt":"I think they really let the quality of the DVD production get away from them.

Random stuff starts happening at various times like ghosts and monsters appearing, a hinting that time has stopped, and dead people as this small group try to escape whatever they are in. Of course, the autistic girl is the center of everything somehow and I really hate how they used this girls affliction and insinuated that she was the cause and to place it in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame.

A group of unlikely heroes including a black guy that gets it first yeah, that clich\u00e9 seems to be still very much alive even in Finland, seem to have trouble trying to exit a mysteriously empty hospital. There are shrieking ghosts very imaginative, zombies at one point I thought at least they did not use zombies, but they came, and Finnish glamrock band with demonic makeup on, getting in their way. There is also some timeshift doodle present, but it adds up nothing to the storyline. Autistic girl and a hobo seem to have some deeper understanding of a situation, but they never spell it out to the viewer, or their confused friends. Their lines consist only of profound life lesson thoughts like What happens will happen... or Light cannot live in the darkness... or the ominous I need a red crayon... red crayon.

Wells outstanding novella. But other than that  well, to call a spade a spade  it sucks bigtime. What the Master Ed Wood could have done with the alleged 20 million dollar budget! Timothy Hines really does make Mr. Wood, who was a flawed genius anyway, look like the best filmmaker of all time. The special effects I guess you would call them that are not even up to computer game standards. The acting is, well, perhaps about dinner theater comparable, and the accents are atrocious. At the risk of sounding offensive, a lot of the acting from the principal male characters is especially Poor Ogilvy, well, ahem, . . . GAY! Poor Ogilvy minces and flounces about the bogus English countryside, waving his asbestos white handkerchief about as if it were heat resistant armor. Hey, the Stormtroopers in Star Wars had neat white body armor too, and it did not work either, they still got blasted. Even when Ogilvy and Company get fried by the Martians Heat Ray?, they flounce and mince in some weird kind of dance, even when they are theoretically DEAD and reduced to skeletons, which persist in unseemly dancing and writhing. Maybe Timothy Hines rented the skeletons from Ray Harryhausen, being left over from Jason And The Argonauts. Or was it Josie And The Pussycats? I dunno. The soldiers, presumably because they are military, all seem to just rather unconvincingly explode, like the soldier on crutches and his unfortunate comrades carrying the stretcher just beyond him. Wow! I loved it! But the soldiers all looked like they were either fascist troops from the Spanish Civil War, or Boer Commandos which would be more or less correct for the period. Perhaps that was some bit of shrewd subtlety on the part of that wicked genius Hines?. Oddly enough, the character of the Curate looks exactly like he is drawn in the original illustrations by Warwick Goble, and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting. Oh, yeah. Musnt forget the THUNDER CHILD. In the book, the warship is described as an ironclad torpedoram. It was MEANT to RAM enemy ships. Yet, it is bow was crumpled after ramming the TinkerToy constructed Martian War Machines, with a tiny jagged hole in the forepeak, and she sank. An ironclad warship like THUNDERCHILD could have rammed the TITANIC and survived, but I guess the Royal Navy was bound by the same lowestbidder constraints as our own Military. The costumes are all wrong, especially the British Army and Police uniforms, cobbled together mostly from USMC Alphas. And Timbo, in an obvious homage to Western Films Of Yore, has obviously set his movie in Wild Western England, because all his riders are using western saddles. The accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of Scottish regional accent used by Clan Macabre, and magically delicious Irish accents from County Malarky. On the credit side, and contrary to what one reviewer wrote, the only genuine, authentic feature of this Thing is the artillery. The guns are not from the Civil War, but appear to my eye and research as bonafide British nine or 12 pounder Rifled Breach Loaders, perfectly authentic to the period. So was the ammunition shown being used. But the Artilleryman, who is a driver in the Horse Artillery, was not shown correctly driving his limber. You do not sit on the frigging limber box and drive a gun team, you ride the nearside wheel horses. The Opening, using what I believe is authentic period film footage, is okay, and the scores not bad. However, to the best of my knowledge Weybridge has never had an underground, and it certainly did not in 1898.But growing up reading this novel, I am very disappointed. Even more disappointed then I was at Spielbergs zillion dollar, special effects laden version. Maybe his version would have profited by swapping Anthony Piana for Tom Cruise, and vice versa. I have a lot more to say, but I will let it go at this for now I wish somebody would make a GOOD version of War Of The Worlds that is faithful to the original. Timmys vision is fine for a high school film class, or maybe I should say pretentiously stupid for a collegelevel film student, and about as bad, which is about the best I can say for this thing, but that is about it. Oh, yeah. Just where DID the budget go? And what happened to Michael Caine? I would like to hear HIS comments!

I must add here that I thought Blackmoons dubbed and abridged version was not only a vast improvement, but an absolute, hysterically funny in a good way treat to watch.

But, let us face it, their victory most likely had very little to do with their great musical talents. The Eurovision contest gradually turned into one big political circus over the years and Lordi probably just won because their song finally brought a little change and \u0096 even more importantly  because their whole act sort of ingeniously spoofed the whole annual event. The absolute last thing Lordis first and hopefully last horror film brings is change and ingenuity. Dark Floors, based on an idea of the lead singer and starring the rest of the band in supportive roles, is a truly unimaginative and hopeless accumulation of clich\u00e9s. The immense budget Dark Floors supposedly is the most expensive Finnish film ever definitely assures greatly macabre set pieces and impressive makeup art, but what is the point where there is no story that is worth telling? The film takes is set in a busy hospital where a bunch of people, among them a father and his young daughter with an unidentifiable illness, become trapped in the elevator during a power breakdown. When the doors open again, the floors are empty and it looks as if the hospital lies abandoned since many years already. Trying to reach the exit, the group stumbles upon several morbid and inexplicable obstacles, like eyeless corpses, screaming ghosts and Heavy Metal monsters emerging from the floors. The only three points I am handing out to Dark Floors are exclusively intended for the scenery and the adequate tension building during the first half of the film. For as long as the sinister events do not require an explanation, the atmosphere is quite creepy, but as soon as you realize the explanation will a be very stupid or b never come, the wholesome just collapses like an unstable house of cards. Lordis costumes never really were scary to begin with except maybe to traditional Eurovision fans and, in combination with a story more reminiscent to Asian ghosthorror, they just look downright pathetic and misfit.

Stevens leads her girl gang of three, and they find out that they must act much quicker than had been anticipated. Despite some neat looks at Las Vegas in the 70s, very average yet credible acting from most involved, and a plot line with potential, Las Vegas Lady lays one big boring egg. It seems forever for the film to kick into gear,and when it does it just sputters here and there and never really speeds up. I was somewhat disappointed with this film. Sure, I was not expecting anything great, but I at least thought this might be one of those neat exploitation films from the 70s or something like it. Not even close. No one dies. There is a lame gunfight between creaky Stuart Whitman and officious George DiCenzo, one year prior to his grand performance as the prosecuting attorney Bugliosa in Helter Skelter. The gunfight has all the suspense of watching a waterfall. There is one punch and one head hit with a blunt instrument. Beyond that nothing in terms of action. And as for the girls, do not expect much there either. Stella and her girlsboth very mediocre yet pretty talents, get in a sauna and a bath. What do we see? Nothing but a fleeting side profile. Stella wears these nice open blouses accentuating her real talents, but I wish she would have been a bit more open with her performance. That way I could write one thing that would recommend the film. Alas, it was not to be, and I have little to say in this films favor. It is not a horrible film in any way, it just has nothing going for it either.

Williams outclasses everything right and left, and looks like he would rather be doing anything else, ANYWHERE else.

I was understandably a little cautious. But, since the item was a gift, I really did not truly pay my common sense much heed. After all....movies for free! So what if they are a little ropey. After much consideration, Alien Intruder was the first of those movies. Ironically, it was first choice because it looked the best of the bunch. All I can say is, if this is the best of them, I shudder to think what the rest are like.On the surface, it had some good things going for it. Four count em! actors that I was familiar with. Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conaway. I told myself...Billy and Tracy have been in some good scifi Star Wars and Babylon 5, respectively so they would not sign up for a turkey. Max is a veteran soap actor who never really managed to break into film....but not too shoddy an actor. An Jeff....well...he is done the good and the bad as far as films and TV go. I was soon to discover that Jeff had decided to add the ugly to his repertoire of movies.The first clue was in the opening scenes. Jeff mugs his way with gusto through an I am mad scene before finally killing himself. An amusing cameo performance, really. Unfortunately this is, without much exaggeration, the highlight of the film. It goes downhill from there.Next up we have the commander of the mission Williams who is being sent out to see what happened to Jeff and his crew busy picking his new shipmates from among the ranks of the criminal element. But this assortment are not so much the Dirty Dozen  more like the Unconvincing Foursome. Plus, one of the crims, a computer hacker, is shown in his cell working away on a laptop computer. Is not that a bit like letting a murderer run a gun shop in the slammer? Pretty lame prison, if you ask me.When they finally take off the effects are truly horrible. It looks like the spaceship model was knocked up in an afternoon by some bored 8 year old who had parts left over from his Airfix kits.But the horror does not stop there. Whilst on route to the area where Jeffs ship vanished, the criminal crew are rewarded for their good behaviour by being given weekends of virtual reality, in which they indulge their male fantasies. All well and good, and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to the Alien Menace which begins to appear there. But did they have to drag it out for quite sooooo loooooong? Alien Intruder? Alien Boring, more like.Finally they make it to GSector and the alien presence makes them fight against each other for her affections until only good old Max is left. The ending, in truly optimistic rubbish film vein, hints at a sequel  as if! Also making an appearance in this movie is a character I will nickname the Sweatdroid. He is supposed to be an android, but apparently that fact was lost on the makeup crew, who provided him with sweaty features at any opportunity. But do not worry, he is just there to make up the body count numbers at the end.Williams and Scoggins, to be truthful, do very little in the film. They only just barely stay awake, let alone act. And, as I mentioned earlier, Jeff gets an early trip to the showers, so his manicness is not allowed to enlighten much of the film. Max tries his best, as do a couple of the other cast members, but the movie is just direly atrocious, to be honest.The one, and only, halfway imaginative thing this movie offers is the ship naming convention. They are all named after musicians  Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the film is bland and uninspired.Made in 1992, I had thought, on initial viewing, it was one of those 80s straighttovideo jobs. Looks like they still made crap movies well into the 90s, it seems.It is best avoided.

In this case, the majority gives it a one. How right they are! To start my review, I will first admit that I am completely clueless as to why this movie is titled Alien Intruder. It does involve space and even an alien I suppose, but there is no rhyme or reason at all for anything in the long run, at least, no actual plot basis or resolution that I can make out anywhere.There are quite a few scenes that are so atrocious with regard to both the lines, the timing, and how they are spoken, that it far exceeds the weird feeling you get when watching similar really bad movies. I have no idea about that part near the beginning where an electronic Bugs Bunny seems to be ranting about something.The plot solely involves an area of space known as the GSpot, sorry, make that GSector...and a virtual reality program infected with some sort of alien? virus. I think it is alien since the image of the otherwise normal Ariel appears as a photographic negative.For most of the movie, we see people getting shot with space weapons, falling out of lofts, and seemingly endless, pointless close shots of Where is Ariel?, Cannot find Ariel pointless because most of the other shots INCLUDE interaction with Ariel, anyway  whatever on a computer monitor. Commander Skyler Billy Dee, sits and watches each fantasy of the convicts VR programs hoping to find this Alien virus and become one with it...??? Or maybe I missed something...Billy Dee Williams took a few courses on how to act in despair prior to the filming of this. We know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers down over his face and looking mournful.The docking scene with the nose of one ship going into the rear of the other was semihilarious at least, and provided for a laugh in addition to the early scenes where we see several shots of the ship as it is just spinning in a circle, looking much like a Lego experiment gone awry.It seems everyone dies in this movie, so why bother? Even the VR females get killed, as if that is supposed to mean anything especially since everyone else dies anyway...outrageous.Because of the money I save on groceries, I will not rant about wanting my money back that I paid for the DVD of this. The dollar that I saved on that bag of vanilla wafers paid for this reviewers time.I will just add that the story itself, at least as a novel, and with far more detail added, could probably be quite interesting with the right author.110","label":0},{"index":9642,"txt":"Who me?

Actually, it would have been more interesting if she had been a vampire, or doing more than just standing around looking at people, which is all she ever does. This is enough to make all the men kill each other. Go figure...This is not really a space flick. There are far more shots of the old western trail, 1950s Easy Rider trail, Film noirs night club scene, even a jog on the beach in fantasyland, none of which has any real depth or even makes any sense. The night club scene is in black and white, of course. Worked with The Wizard of Oz. Does not work so well, here. This is probably a good thing, as those few shots they DO show of space are depressingly silly. You will probably cry during those moments, especially upon seeing that swirling space ship, which looks about three inches long.Nothing is felt for any of the characters, not because they are convicts or have no personality, but because they are in serious need of acting lessons, except for Billy Dee Williams who really does look depressed and at a loss, probably by being in this work...This is one of those movies that, when viewed with friends, is going to cause some extremely loud silences, especially when the nerd throws out his attempt at comic oneliners including the line about Frenchkissing a meteor...?

The fourth of the series to be hospitalbased, it is possibly the least of the genre. There is a curiously flat feel throughout, with all seemingly squandered on belowpar material. This is far from the late70s nadir, but Williams, James, Bresslaw, Maynard et al. are all class performers yet not given the backing of a script equal to their ability.Most of the gags are onrunning, rather than episodic as Carry Ons usually are. So that instead of the traditional hit and miss ratio, if you do not find the joke funny in the first place you are stuck with it for most of the film. These continuous plot strands include Williams \u0096 for no good reason \u0096 worrying that he is changing sex, and Kenneth Cope in drag. Like the stagy physical pratt falls, the whole thing feels more contrived than in other movies, and lacking in cast interest. Continuing this theme, Matron lacks the customary pun and innuendo format, largely opting for characterisation and consequence to provide the humour. In fact, the somewhat puerile series of laboured misunderstandings and forced circumstance reminds one more of Terry and June ... so it is appropriate that Terry Scott is present, mugging futilely throughout.Some dialogue exchanges have a bit of the old magic, such as this between Scott and Cope What about a little drink? Oh, no, no, I never touch it. Oh. Cigarette then? No, I never touch them. That leaves only one thing to offer you. I never touch that either. That said, while a funny man in his own right livening up the duller episodes of Randall and Hopkirk Deceased no end, you do feel that Cope is not quite tapped in to the selfparodying Carry On idealology and that Bernard Bresslaw dressed as a nurse would be far funnier. This does actually happen, in part, though only for the last fifteen minutes.Williams attempting to seduce Hattie Jacques while Charles Hawtrey is hiding in a cupboard is pure drawer room farce, but lacks the irony to carry it off. That said, Williamss description of premarital relations is priceless You do not just go into the shop and buy enough for the whole room, you tear yourself off a little strip and try it first! That may be so, counters Jacques, but you are not going to stick me up against a wall.

Polly Walker is a lovely and accomplished actress see Enchanted April and Patriot Games, in which she also costarred with Sean Bean, but she appears colorless and lackluster. She has a cold sore on her lip that makeup cannot hide, and the costumes do not seem authentic. The late Robert Stephens does a respectable turn as Sir Ensor Doone, although he only refers to Lorna as his favorite rather than his granddaughter, which she was reputed to be in the book. Also, it seems to me that Owen and Walker are too old for their roles maybe it is the makeup and the scenery is brown, cold, gray and barren, without so much of a hint of a sunny sky. I understand that it is set in Southwest England, but it is green there and they do get their sunshine!!! The portrayal of Tom Faggus character and his death, which does not happen in the novel, depresses the film even more. The one positive note is Sean Beans performance as Carver. Although it does not even come close to matching Aidan Gillens portrayal in the AE movie, Bean does make one mean villain. In short, watch this only if you have got a few hours to kill, but do not expect anything exciting or for it to be true to the novel. See any other version  but I highly recommend AEs film over this tired adaptation.","label":0},{"index":9664,"txt":"Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many missing characters, no romantic scenes, changes in story line, too short, appeared low budget. Hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you are not familiar with the novel. In some scenes it looks like Lorna has a cold sore on her upper lip. I am sure makeup did it is best to hide it. I guess they did not want to halt filming until it healed up, pity. Most likely why this movie lacked kissing scenes. Only one disappointing kissing scene at the very end. Lorna Doone is a great epic tale and should be told true. The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long, more romantic, much more enjoyable and more true to the book.","label":0},{"index":9665,"txt":"Holy freaking God allfreakingmighty.

Then it switches to a farshot with a ridiculous CG horse. And the CG in general seems to be subpar to 1992s Beyond the Minds Eye. I mean, Come on, really.

The tension was just not there, since the killer was known very early. The finale was, again, neither dramatic nor tense nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next.

Moreover, Jared Letos character does not really contribute to the story whatsoever except saving one main characters life at one point, but that scene is as necessary as a windshield wiper on a submarine in the first place ;Speaking of unnecessary scenes  the main complaint is really the tangled and clich\u00e9ridden storyline The detective of course! has to settle a personal matter with the villain and is of course! suspended from his official duties courtesy of his personal entanglement. The killer of course! wants to be tracked down and plays a catandmouse game with his opponent for years ...

However, I felt it deserved the benefit of the doubt. I had no high hopes of Joe Dirt eitheranother recent comedy starring an SNL cast memberand I ended up being pleasantly surprised. But this film is just as bad as it looks in the previews. Chris Kattan is actually a talented comic actorcontrary to what you might think after watching this moviewith great energy. He is been in many hilarious SNL skits, and I think he is one of the most talented cast members on SNL as of now. In this case, he is given a lame, pointless script and he tries to remedy each scene with his incessant mugging. Throughout each scene, he attempts a lame Jerry Lewis act and fails miserably. Jerry Lewis knew how to pull off this type of physical comedy, not to mention he worked with much better writing. Kattan simply looks like some ignorant fool with ADHD who had one too many Cafe Lattes. He does not even wait for the punchline; he assumes we will all laugh once he starts jumping around like an ape on crack. In one scene, he ends up in a tugging match with a dog who has a package of cocaine in his mouth. The package explodes and the cocaine splashes all over him. He comes back to the job, strung out on coke. Now, how are we supposed to laugh at the fact that he is acting hyper and onedge, when he is doing the same thing throughout the whole film? As for the rest of the cast members...Vanessa Shaw is really hot, Peter Berg is wasted in a thankless role and so is Chris Penn. Peter Falk is also wasted, though he has a few funny lines that I am pretty sure he improvised. I hope Falk gets a decent movie someday soon. That is too much talent too waste on a clunker like Corky Romano. I did not like Falks last movie Made all that much either, but at least he had a decent role. I chuckled a few times, but I could not get a single laugh. Each gag is performed with no sense of timing or delivery. And it is made worse by Kattans hammy acting. And there are certain gags that are streneously dragged out. For example, when Kattan is about to fart in his two brothers faces. He stands there for 2 or 3 minutes, trying to get out a fart and when he finally he does it is a little tiny one. It is bad enough when you have a gag that is funny and drag it out, but when you have a lame gag and you drag it out it is a hell of a lot worse. And another example of this is when he tries to translate what those two Asian men are saying during a drug bust.

I like bad films, as they are often the most entertaining. I love bad special effects, bad acting, bad music, and inept direction. With the exception of the music which was better than I had expected, this movie had all of those qualities. The special effects were amazingly bad. The worst I have seen since my Nintendo 64. Some scenes to watch for include the Thunderchild, the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot, the Big Ben scene, the train wreck... Wow, there are so many bad effects! On the plus side, though, SOME scenes of the alien walkers are well done.The acting was about as bad as it could possibly have been, having been based directly on H.G. Wells book. For having such good source material, it is almost as though the actors were trying to be so overthetop as to make it funny. And then there is the mustache... the single most distracting piece of facial hair I have seen in a long time. Of course, only half the movie contains acting. The rest is characters walking around aimlessly and poorly rendered effects shots.To say that Timothy Hines is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors. With the use of different colored filters between shots for no particular reason, the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside scenes, the bad green screening, it is amazing to me how this man ever got approval to direct a movie. I would not imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this bad a movie. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Bravo. My advice to anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what I did have some friends who enjoy bad movies over, drink, play poker while watching it, keep drinking, and maybe you will make it all the way through.

It does not take long to realize that this movie is big, bigger than Kindergarten Cop or Police Academy 7. The sheer greatness of it left me speechless as I walked out of the movie theater and proceeded right back to the ticket counter to purchase myself another dozen of tickets.This is a movie that simply requires multiple viewings. The first watching will surely leave you with that strange Huh? feeling, but do not feel embarrassed  it happens to the best of us. The story is so diabolically clever that one has to wonder about the mortality of its authors. What seems to be a simple story of an idiot infiltrating the FBI, turns out to be an allegorical story that works on several levels and teaches us all about the really important things in life. The complexity of the plot structure will baffle you on your first viewing, but do not give up! Not until my sixth or seventh viewing did I only begin to unravel some of the hidden mysteries of Corky Romano. And watch out for the unexpected twist at the end, otherwise you might be caught completely off guard when it is revealed that FBI agent Brick Davis is FBIs mostwanted criminal, Corky is not a real FBI agent, Pops Romano is innocent, Peter Romano admits he is illiterate and Paulie Romano comes out of the closet as a homosexual. Surprised the hell out of me, I can tell you that much.Chris Kattans comedic talents are unmatched as he leads his character Corky Romano through a maze of totally unpredictable situations. Reminiscent of John Reynolds performance in Manos, the Hands of Fate, Kattan takes on innumerable multiple personalities and tackles all scenes with perfect comedic timing. However, Kattan is not just about comedy. He is a master of drama as well, as he controls the audiences feelings with the slightest moves of his face. His facial expressions reflect life itself, in a way. For example, in the scene in which he farts into his brothers faces, you can see the expression of social injustice and alienation clearly reflected on his anguished face. At a moment like that, it is hard to find a dry eye in the house.Screenwriters David Garret and Jason Ward are the real heroes of Corky Romano. With a story of such proportions, it is easy to understand why two experienced writers had to be employed to complete this ambitious project. Their skillful storytelling and unorthodox structuring makes Pulp Fiction look like a mediocre Saturday Night Live skit. Garret and Wards story is so compelling and alluring that it grips you by your hair, swallows you entirely, shakes you around and spits you right out. At the end of the outofthisworld experience known as Corky Romano you find yourself a different person with different worldviews and different ideas, and with only one question on your mindWhy, God? Why?!?","label":0},{"index":9679,"txt":"Direction must be the problem here. I recently heard John Cleese speaking of working a skit for Fawlty Towers. He was supposed to attack his car with a branch. The first branch was too flimsy and not funny. The second branch was too stiff to be funny. The third was just flimsy enough to be funny. This sort of attention to detail is missing from Corky Romano. No matter how embarrassingly unfunny a comic bit was, it was not fixed, and was not left on the cutting room floor. The one value I can find in this movie is as a study of a very flawed movie which somehow escaped into distribution without being repaired.I have scanned dozens of other reviews here. The number of reviews praising this absolute waste of time bolsters my suspicion that some people are getting paid to promote titles. I cannot fathom how anyone over the age of 9 could rate this title more than a 4, MAX. I mean, come on, 5 is average.

I stopped the DVD after watching for half an hour and I suggest anyone thinking of watching themselves it stop themselves before taking the disc out of the case.I like Mafia movies both tragic and comic but Corky Romano can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy.The problem is Corky Romano simply tries too hard to get the audience to laugh, the plot seems to be an excuse for moving Chris Kattan Corky from one scene to another. Corky himself is completely overplayed and lacks subtlety or credulity  all his strange mannerisms come across as contrived  Chris Kattan is clearly acting rather than taking a role  it bounces you right out of the story. Each scene is utterly predictable, the comedic event that will occur on the set is obvious as soon as each scene is introduced. In comedies such as Mr. Bean the disasters caused by the title character are funny because you can empathise with the characters motivations and initial event and the situation the character ends up in is not telegraphed. Corky however gives the feeling that he is deliberately screwing up in a desperate attempt to draw a laugh from the audience.If Chris had not played such an alien character who never really connects with the other characters in the movie and whose behaviour is entirely inexplicable except for trying to draw laughs and the comedy scenes were not so predictable and stereotyped  all the jokes seemed far too familiar this movie could have been watchable.

Well, if being so stupidly annoying and unfunny is a reason, then this film is it. The character of Corky Romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst. The gags are predictable but that is not what makes it bad. They are the lame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would say.Corky Romano is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy. His quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once spurned him now needs him to infiltrate the FBI to destroy any trace of the familys crime history. However, it is not that easy for Corky because the FBI believes him to be a super agent and pegs him with the duty of spying on his very own family. Mishaps and mayhem ensue but it really does not feel like any comic hijixn are there. Corky ends up in love with his beautiful FBI partner and has to set the record straight with both the FBI and his family if he is to settle down to the quiet life again.I think what makes this film irritating is both the lead actor and the supposed jokes. Chris Kattan reveals his alarming limitations as and actor here as his one note slapstick routine falls flat about 10 minutes into the film. It is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb, slap stick humor. Will Ferrel, Kattans SNL partner, seems to have made a full career out of it. The only difference between Kattan and Ferrel is that Ferrel knows when to tone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke. There is absolutely no diversity in Kattans routine. It is hard to hear the same joke twice, but for a whole movie that is just pure torture.The other problem with the movie was the lack of truly original and FUNNY jokes. The gay mafia brother, the awkward guy schtick, and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it. It seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it. Even with a cast that has some comedic talent Chris Penn, Peter Falk the jokes that commence are tired. There is no chemistry too. This film was obviously one for the pocketbooks for the actors. No body seemed to care about it, or even try. Sad thing is, no body told Chris Kattan that.","label":0},{"index":9685,"txt":"Probably the only thing that got the movie up to a four for me is the fact that I love Peter Falk. One of the worlds great portrayers of bumbling incompetence . . . and yet he is one of the only anchors that prevents this from being a chaotic disaster. As Pops Romano, he provides a respectable mix of gangster charm and straight man to Chris Kattans manic foolishness. Respectable performances are also offered by Richard Roundtree as the harried boss, Vinessa Shaw as a talented female FBI agent bouncing her head off a glass ceiling and Fred Ward as Falks advisor and Benedict Arnold.The plot concept actually has some wonderful possibilities and, in the hands of a young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase, could have proved a great comedic vehicle. Kattan, who seems to idolize Ernest or Pee Wee Herman, just provides a muddled mess. Sadly, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who portray his misfit brothers, both fall far short of their proven capability.There are some very funny scenes, but they are far too few and separated by way too many boring ones. What I truly miss here is what always attracted me to the Leslie Neilsen movies. There is no second level of wit riding over the slapstick. No cultural references that only the adults get. . no double entendre. . it is just silly.And, by the way, this does not all mean that I am recommending it for your 9yearold, because hopefully they have better taste and less fascination with some of their body parts and their functions.","label":0},{"index":9686,"txt":"The script for this TV soap opera is so bad that even A.

Let me start with what is actually good about this film. It does stay true to the book AND there are a few good performances in it. I can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film. But good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible... and I do mean horrible special effects. Any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with the CGI. To me, most of it looked like stop action card board cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated CGI software that a 20 Million project should be using.There is no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film. My own partner and I sat down and recreated our version of the Ferry scene using software that cost less than 1500.00 and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what Hines created. I have seen films with budgets of less than 2 Million look better. Much better.In my opinion the special effects used in the original King Kong were more sophisticated and better than Hines special effects in this film. IN fact, I have a much better appreciation for Attack of the Killer Tomatoes because of this film. There is no excuse with todays technology for a film to look like a 50s BMovie unless that was the intention, which should not have been with this particular project.A problem I had with the DVD transfer was that the film is jerky, another demonstration of amateur filmmaking.Overall, I have to say that I produced a 45,000 project in 2003 that have better cinematography and special effects than this film.I strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good filmmaking or who is a fan of WOTW to leave this film on the shelf and watch Attack of the 50 Foot Woman instead.

But whatever chances you are ready to give to Cama de Gato, they shrink to zero within 10 minutes it is an unbelievably preposterous, verbose, ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray Brazilian uppermiddle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neoNazis hooked on bad sex, drugs and violence and they are made to look like closeted gays too, made with no visible trace of talent, imagination, expertise or notion of structure. Visually and aurally, it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on YouTube  only here it lasts NINETY TWO countem minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness, and it is not even funnybad.We have all seen the story before bored young guys want to have fun, go partying, take drugs and everything goes wrong  there is gangrape, spanking, murder, the accidental death falling down the staircase!! of the mother of one of the boys, culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill. Moral and literal garbage, get it? The film is heavily influenced by Larry Clark especially Kids and Bully, but Clarks films  though also moralist and sexploitative  are highclass masterworks compared to this crap.I do not think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audiences throat Stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his nonstop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion  you DO get numbminded with so much babbling, yelling, inept direction, shaky camera and terrible acting going on. Stockler does not care a bit about technique the quality of the images, framing, sound recording, soundtrack songs, dialog, sets, editing, etc is uniformly appalling, but he is a narcissistic controlfreak he anticipates the criticisms he is bound to get by adding subtitles with smartiecutie comments, and by making the protagonists comment at one point how farfetched and phony it all is I could relate to THAT. Despite his megalomaniac ambitions, Stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure  he cannot even decide if he wants gritty realism handheld video camera etc or stylization repetition of scenes, use of alternate takes, etc. Damn, he cannot even decide WHERE to put his camera there is use of subjective camera for the THREE leads! The dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever; the plot exists simply to justify the directors profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for. All you see is a filmmaker being hateful, preachy, condemning, moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent or technique to go with it.It is very disappointing to find Caio Blat in this mess. Certainly one of the most promising young film actors in Brazil, with his sleepyeyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall Sal Mineos, Blat can be highly effective under good direction as in Carandiru, Lavoura Arcaica, Proibido Proibir. Here, he is told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly underequipped actors in recent memory. He also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes so goddawful they look rather like webcam porn.The film opens and ends with real interviews with typical ? middleclass youth  Stockler wants us to take those interviews as proof of what he is trying to preach in fiction. But he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees, selecting a highlight of abject, racist, sexist, stupid statements which only shows assholes exist everywhere. Stockler wants to prove that Brazilian middleclass youths are ALL present or future fascists BECAUSE they are middleclass and enjoy recreational drugs is he saying all neofascists are on drugs?? Or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior?? I could not tell. With its dogmatic selfrighteousness, headacheinducing technique and mindbending boredom, Cama de Gato is bad for a 1,000 reasons but, above all, it is harmful in a very insidious manner it gives detractors of Brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument.

Well, this Neil Simon comedy looks at what it is like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office. Sometimes, it is just not worth going, know what I mean? And, sometimes, it is just not worth doing something when it is already been done before, in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis... and much better also.It is not that Steve Martin is a lousy comedian or wrong for the role as the harried and stressed advertising exec; quite to the contrary, on both counts. And, it is not that Goldie Hawn is equally inept either; her work has been consistently good, if not great, ever since I first saw her in TVs Rowan and Martins LaughIn of the 1960s.The problem with this movie is that it is not about the hapless couple at all it is really about New York and why everybody should come to New York to live and love their lives away in married bliss \u0096 sort of \u0096 in the greatest city in the world. That is if you are a New Yorker...Look, the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere, and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment. This 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous tangents specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess. For example, not content with the star appeal of the main players, there is a cameo relatively long also from Rudy Giuliani, then mayor of New York, as we all know. What \u0096 Giuliani bucking for President even then? Worse \u0096 a walking talking advertisement for the kinder face of New York.And then we have John Cleese, reprising his role as Basil Fawlty \u0096 but this time, as a prancing crossdresser also \u0096 once again browbeating hotel staff, sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is, in this role. And, in the process, doing great damage to the memory of Fawlty Towers, arguably the best British comedy series, bar none...Why was this 1999 movie made? In the 1970s, New York was a dying city, in many ways. It was almost literally bankrupt. So, when made in 1970, that was the city you saw grim, dark, moody, unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the Big Smoke as it was then, polluted and all. By 1999, things had gotten better glitz was back, New York was thriving, it was the Big Apple, ready for you to bite into, if you had the moxie...So, naturally, the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and finally join the fabulous fray to continue the American dream of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Hence, this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps envisaged. As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in comedy, this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great Jack Lemmon.

Valkyrie 2008 at long last tells the world there was a German resistance during world war two professionally organised with bureaucrats, military generals, soldiers and civilians who tried to over throw the Nazi political regime, install a new chancellor, obtain peace and close the concentration camps. However, these unknown absolute heroes received no help at all from the allies who helped the French resistance just next door. History writers have used an institutionalised agenda ever since to conceal an allied evil which cost many tens of millions of lives with everyone conditioned to believe a deception that the German people completely supported the Nazis and consequently deserved the 24 hour bombing genocide and unconditional surrender that was imposed on the Germans. The German enigma codes were broken by English scientists in 1943 so much of what the Germans were doing was known. During 1943 the Germans developed new jet fighters and jet bombers by companies including Arado, Heinkel and Messerschmitt. However, even if the Nazis were eliminated and the German resistance succeeded the allies would not allow any democracy in the world to have jet fighters, jet bombers, high speed submarines, ballistic missiles and radio guided missiles without the USA having them first! This is where the institutionalised agenda is relevant. Consequently, the German resistance got no help at all from the allies although they always had crucial intelligence to eliminate Adolf Hitler. The 20 July 1944 coup is proof there were significant efforts by the Germans to obtain peace. Instead, the Germans got ultimatums of unconditional surrender and 24 hour saturation bombing in an agenda to avoid peace. The allies wanted to steal the worlds greatest technology and scientists from the Germans and contain complete ownership through an unconditional surrender. It was a premeditated allied agenda to allow the war to perpetuate and keep the Nazis in power to justify the 24 hour bombing but it took one year after dday before allied armies advanced into Germany to steal the worlds greatest technology and scientists at the barrel of a gun. However, tens of millions of people had died since the allies abandoned the German resistance for their own greed. The allies imposed unconditional surrender on the Germans as a pretext to complete ownership and control of German property and government and it was done without using the German resistance to over throw the Nazis. The allies wanted to steal the worlds greatest technology and scientists from the Germans to achieve world technological supremacy. Consequently, everything else took second place to the evil allied agenda which killed millions of German people in the 24 hour bombing; the concentration camps stayed open; the war was prolonged and led to the cold war with weapons based on German industrial achievements, technology, and scientists taken from the Germans in world war two.The 1946 Nuremburg war crimes trials were a public relations deception and mass murder perpetrated by the allies as retrospective justice to the Nazis. It was a smoke screen to hide the evil and greedy allied agenda for world technological supremacy rather than help the German resistance overthrow the nazi political regime.Tens of millions of people died because the allies abandoned the German resistance to an agenda but they inflicted retribution against the German chiefs of staff anyway whom paid with their lives at Nuremburg war crimes or not although the allies had perpetrated genocide to achieve world technological supremacy.","label":0},{"index":9712,"txt":"Apparently most viewer knows nothing about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and the whole Central and Eastern Europe as well as the Hitler and Stalin Era.

They rang louder when a title card referred to Americas Civil War as the War Between the States the circumlocution preferred by diehard southerners. Jesse James  thief, slaveholder and murderer  is described as a quiet, gentle farm boy.How dishonest is this movie? There is NO mention of slavery, far less of the documented fact that Jesse Jamess poor widdered mother owned slaves before the war, and that Jesse and his brother Frank actively fought to preserve slavery. According to this movie, all those Civil War soldiers were really fighting to decide whether Missouri is a northern state or a southern state ... that is ALL. Missouri It is a candy mint! It is a breath mint! Black people are entirely absent from this movie, except for two glimpses of a pair of beggars, one of whom wears a HELP THE POOR sign that is very implausibly typeset instead of handwritten. Some shots of 19thcentury newspapers are inaccurate too, with 20thcentury type fonts.This film has a weird flashback structure. There is some very impressive stunt riding and some fine work by stunt horses, and one excellent montage. I savoured one line of dialogue Some of those boys will never taste beans again. The movie gets a few facts straight Agnes Moorehead, as Jesses mother, conceals her right arm in the scenes following the raid by the agents of Pinkerton here called Remington in which Jesse Jamess reallife mother suffered injuries requiring the amputation of her lower arm. Some errors here are pardonable during his bushwhacking days, the real Jesse James accidentally shot off part of his left middle finger, but Robert Wagner in the title role here does not have a stumpfinger. I have seen a photo of Jesse Jamess real wife; if she had looked half as glamorous as Hope Lange looks in this movie, Jesse James might have stayed home more.There is plenty of revisionism here, and most of the male actors wear 1950s hairstyles. But many of this movies errors were avoidable. Jesse Jamess mentor William Quantrill is mentioned several times, but all the actors mispronounce his name. We see Jesse and his wife moving into an elaborate twostorey house where he will soon die after paying a rent of 18. Actually, Jesse Jamess last residence at 1318 Lafayette Street, St Joseph, Missouri was a simple onestorey cottage, renting for 14. There was no upper storey ... so, when Jesse James is killed, his wife could not come running from upstairs as Hope Lange does here. She was actually in the kitchen.One continuity error Robert Wagner with no stunt double does an impressive job of taking a slug to the jaw and falling over while his hands are tied behind his back ... but when he gets up, the rope binding his wrists has vanished.The screenplay does some weird and unnecessary juggling of dates. Following the Northfield robbery attempt, Jesse says he expects to get home by his birthday. The actual Northfield bank raid by the James Gang 7 September, 1876 was two days AFTER Jesse Jamess birthday. Maybe he meant next years birthday. Later, we see Jesse and his wife moving into their St Joseph home on a fine summer day, while Jesse tells her what he plans to do when Christmas Eve arrives ... but in real life, Mr and Mrs Jesse James moved into that house on 24 December, 1881 ... so this scene should BE on Christmas Eve! These errors were entirely avoidable.Some of the fictionalisations here do not make sense. According to this movie, the Northfield bank raid failed because one fictional henchman was late in cutting the telegraph wires. If this had actually happened, it would indeed have hampered the James Gangs getaway ... but it would not have affected the robbery itself, which failed for other reasons.There are good performances here by Jeffrey Hunter as Frank James, Moorehead, Alan Hale Jnr as Cole Younger and by stage actress Marian Seldes in a rare screen role. I was disappointed by Robert Wagner, normally an underrated actor. Elsewhere, Wagner has proved his impressive range by convincingly portraying heroes, villains and morally ambiguous characters. Here, he cannot seem to decide whether to depict Jesse James as a goodie or a baddie ... so he does not much bother. John Carradine phones in his performance in a brief role as a fictional jackleg preacher who baptises Jesse and his wife at their wedding. In fact, Jesse James was baptised in childhood by his uncle, a Methodist minister ... but perhaps this second baptism is a toppingup.Jesse James was no Robin Hood. I doubt that Robin Hood was Robin Hood either, but that is another story. There is not one single documented instance of Jesse James ever sharing his loot with anyone beyond his own family. After some of his holdups, he did not even split the swag with the rest of his gang. In this movie, Jesse gets gunned down right after he vows to give up his bandit ways forever. In reality, the night before his death, Jesse James and the Ford brothers stole horses that Jesse planned to use the next day in a robbery of the Platte City bank. As preparation for most of his robberies, Jesse James stole horses from local farmers ... the same poor folk who in the inaccurate legends were supposedly the beneficiaries of his largesse. I cringed at one scene here, in which the fictional Jesse James is so goldurn refined that he disapproves of an oil painting which tastefully depicts nudes.The True not much! Story of Jesse James is wilfully dishonest about a thieving murderer, and likewise dishonest about the Civil War.

This was a major error on Zanucks part as Wagner proved to be a less than a suitable replacement. With the possible exceptions of Broken Lance 1954 and Between Heaven  Hell 1956 it is hard to think of Wagner distinguishing himself in anything! Also, Jeffrey Hunter was nothing more than a Fox contract player before being assigned to play Frank James to Wagners Jesse in The True Story Of Jesse James. Borrowed from the studio the previous year this actors one distinguishing mark was his excellent and revealing performance in John Fords classic The Searchers. But his playing here, along with Wagner as the second half of the James Brothers, is nothing short of boring. Neither player bring any personality or colour to their respective roles. They totally miss the mark, lacking the charisma and appeal so vividly displayed by Power and Fonda in the original. The movie is also marred by too many flashbacks and with the all over the place screenplay Wagner, as the Robin Hood of the American west, comes across as a charmless introverted twit that you can feel no empathy for whatsoever.

He is the critics darling because he supposedly makes films with a message or he is just so bohemian in his approach that it makes critics that are waterlogged from formula Hollywood films eat his stuff up just for being different.Summer Of Sam does not even do that well. The cinematography and editing style is Oliver Stone, and so is the narrative. The plot is a lot like Do The Right thing. The portrayal of Guidos or for the PC set ItalianAmericans of which I happen to be one is straight out of Eddie Murphys Raw. Only Eddie Murphys impression of a macho Italian guy picking a fight with a much taller AfricanAmerican is much, MUCH more believable than the cartoonish, broad Italian caricatures shown here the John Leguizamo character being a possible exception.Is there anybody who saw this movie that could not figure out how it was going to end up? As soon as Richie came into the film I could already see the fist in his face and the foot in his stomach, I could already see him being accused of being the killer. This character had the most integrity in the whole film so, of course, Lee is going to show what happens to people that stand out in a crowd what a white bearded clique!Someone please, please give Spike Lee a lifetime pass to all the Basketball games he wants. So, maybe he will be enjoying himself too much to pick up a film camera for a long time and we will not have to be subjected to his self important drivel and furthermore I will not have to see critics some of them whom I respect ohhhh and ahhhh to an Emperor with no clothes.","label":0},{"index":9723,"txt":"I went to this movie expecting a concise movie relating the effect the Son of Sam had on the society.

All in all, we were very disappointed at this Spike Lee effort!!","label":0},{"index":9725,"txt":"Before I give Spike Lees mess of a film SUMMER OF SAM a welldeserved thrashing, I would like to make one thing clear. I do not revile this film simply for its abundance of sleazy and unpleasant images. What makes this film so unwatchable is the fact that Lee seems to believe that SUMMER OF SAM should be taken seriously as a socially enlightening drama. The crime caper films of Quentin Tarantino, for example, are filled with violence, profanity, and other sleaze, but are nonetheless highly watchable because Tarantino does not attempt to pass these films off as socially redeeming works of art. He knows that such films are for entertainment value only. On the other hand, serious dramas such as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and SCHINDLERS LIST are often unpleasant to watch, but the unpleasantness serves to develop the films plot and characters, with the end goal of getting the audience emotionally involved with the story and characters onscreen. SUMMER OF SAM, unfortunately, merely wallows in its own sensationalism and sleaze, while believing that it is serving as social commentary, much like other trash epics .SUMMER OF SAM does not serve as a serious drama because its characters are merely cardboardcutout stereotypes. Its plot purports to show the emotional impact of the hysteria over the Son of Sam murders on the residents of the predominately ItalianAmerican north Bronx neighborhood where the murders ocurred. However, instead of of presenting the locals as a diverse mix of personalities, Lee simply wheels out every negative Italian stereotype imaginable. The men are ignorant, lazy, oversexed goombahs. The women are split between weak, complacent good girls Mira Sorvinos Dionna and promiscuous bad girls Jennifer Espositos Ruby. Lee seems to vindictively wants to payback Hollywood for their years of negative AfricanAmerican stereotyping by wheeling out stereotypes of his own, and few critics seem to care. If Martin Scorsese, for example, presented residents of an AfricanAmerican neighborhood as a bunch of Amos n Andy and Aunt Jemima stereotypes, critics would rightfully condemn such blatant stereotyping. More importantly, onedimensional, stereotypical characters undermine any film that attempts to be a serious social commentary.Without exception, the cast of SUMMER OF SAM is excellent. However, the acting, for the most part, is uninspired. The cast is either just going through the motions, or they have little to work with scriptwise. Additionally, there is notable miscasting. Comedian John Leguizamo is very talented, but his Vinny character seems to be a stale, comedic impersonation of John Travoltas Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. And Michael Badalucco, a perennial nice guy actor, is badly miscast as serial killer David Berkowitz, coming across as funny rather than frightening. The only performance worth paying attention to is Adrien Brody as the troubled, but sincere, neighborhood misfit Ritchie. The Brody performance and the typically stylish Lee cinematography are this films only virtues.12 out of ","label":0},{"index":9726,"txt":"I am afraid that I have to disagree with the majority. I found Spike Lees latest a wee bit boring! Although he was trying something different, i.e. not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer, I do not think it worked too well.There is really a bit too much going on  Vinny John Leguizamo and Dionnas Mira Sorvino relationship, Ritchies Adrien Brody lifestyle and then the local mafia types. The story is good, but at the end thats all you have  2 or 3 stories. With such a provocative killer could Mr Lee not have put more into that side of the film? There are some good points though.

They are already living caricatures, so Lee only amplifies them, rather than simply portraying them.When someone has a caricature done of themselves, they do not go home and say, Hey, let us make the ears and nose even bigger! That is what Lee has done in this film. The most interesting characters in the film are the two Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito who wish to escape the Guido lifestyle. Top it off with an uninteresting storyline for the characters, particularly John Leguizamos, and you get a nice film to fall asleep by.

The directors star appeal and the subject matter was sufficient fodder to spark interest and ticket sales, but this is a flop. The multiple story lines all go from bad to silly by the pictures end, and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten. What Spike is able to achieve is revenge against any Italians who may have beat him up when he was a kid or insulted him, as the movie does quite a number on perpetuating outdated and probably offensive Italian stereotypes. As with any Spike Lee film there is some really thought provoking and magical camerawork.

Summer Of Sam conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer, David Berkowitz. It is not. It is a gritty, earthy portrait of NYC street life during the hot summer of 77 when Berkowitz terrorized that city.The film follows several young fictional characters in an ItalianAmerican neighborhood, and their reactions to the Son of Sam threat. There is Vinny and his wife Dionna; there is Richie and Ruby, and several other characters.The problem is that these characters are not likable. They are routinely annoying, and at times unbearable. Lee then belabors their high energy, chaotic lives, which are filled with anger, lust, and general turmoil. There are at least two protracted fight scenes between Vinny and his wife, redundant disco dance scenes, countless gabfests ... Over and over I kept wondering where is the film editor?Meanwhile, with all that bulk, the film passes up the chance to convey any real sense of fear or dread arising from the Son of Sam menace, which is too much in the background. Lee is more successful at showing a different kind of menace, that arising from neighborhood vigilante groups.The acting is uniformly good. That, combined with 70s disco music, and lavish attention to costumes and production design, make you really feel like you are in an ItalianAmerican neighborhood in NYC in 1977.The films atmospheric authenticity, however, is not nearly enough to offset a rambling, overblown script about the lives of grossly irritating people.","label":0},{"index":9731,"txt":"Why?That simple question had to be on the lips of every single New Yorker during the 12 months of terror that David Berkowitz created in 197677.

He presents an ensemble of despicable losers who hear their own barking dogs as they live lives devoid of love, honor and humanity  no different than Berkowitz. Lee browbeats the audience in nearly every frame with not one of us are what we seem to be. Often a critic of the white establishment, Lee perpetuates the stereotype by including a scene where Mira Sorvino, playing a newlywed with a cheating husband John Leguizamo, hopes to have oral sex with a black man in the back of a big black Cadillac. An Italian Mafioso tells a black detective that the famous Willie Mays overtheback center field catch was lucky. Lee even makes sure to deliver the racist musings of one middle aged black woman who declares I am happy it is a white man killing all these white people because if it were a black man killing all these white people  there would be the biggest race riot in NYC history.Other than an outstanding opening pan shot of an arrival at a disco reminiscent of shots from Martin Scorceses Goodfellas or Orson Welles The Third Man, this film has no soul, purpose or passion. He parades characters on the screen bereft of human decency. Although we learn nothing about the true victims of this horrible spree, Spike Lee seems to be saying New York City got what it deserved during that frightening, boiling summer over two decades ago.How could anyone wreak such havoc on his beloved city?

That said everything previously mentioned about this film is true. For a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all. The list of problems with the film could drag on forever. Chief amongst them is the film is simply too long. It dragged on for a few minutes short of 3 hours. Nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly. Secondly, as many had pointed out from the trailers, the special effects are anything but special. The tripods looked OK in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was gradeZ 1970s or 1980s quality. Probably the worst effects of all were the horses, which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved. The heat ray effects were laughable, as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles. Also pitiful was the Thunderchild sequence, in which the Thunderchild, described in the book as an ironclad ram, looked nothing of the sort. Instead it resembled a World War 1 era destroyer, complete with deck guns which fired but had no visible crew, and torpedo tubes. The colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects. Most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out Mars to her in the sky. Well, the sky is black, but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight. There is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape, bathed in full sunlight, and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars. To detract even further, the color of the scenes made no sense. In some they are bathed in orange light. In others green light. In still others it is blue light. In some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue. The framerate and camera is very shaky, giving everything a stuttering look.Finally, the acting is overall subpar. One man portrays two characters who is sole difference was one lacked a mustache. This led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were. The English accents, even to American ears, are outrageous. In summary, this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times. I have not seen Gigli or some of the other recent flops but this one, because of it is poor quality in every respect, must easily be worse then anything that mainstream Hollywood has put out.

Well that is the idea anyway, but instead most of the film is devoted to displaying these frat boys relationship escapades, abound with an outrageous lesbian subplot. Very little of the actual story is devoted to Halloween or the mysterious spell book. It actually makes me mad that the film makers thought they could get away with making such dribble. The film is essentially about frat boy relationships. This IS NOT what the movie is billed as. I am tempted to track down the producers and at the very least threaten them with bodily harm.

There is not really any gore to speak of, nor are there any real scares.I have thought about this one from almost every approach. If it was supposed to be a tight, suspenseful horror movie which would explain why things moved so slowly, the pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters would invalidate it. If it was supposed to be a genuine blood  guts horror movie which would explain the schlock... where is the blood and guts?

A bunch of frat boys, along with assorted girlfriends  volunteers, is setting up a charity haunted house. The project is being presided over by a thoroughly repellent character, whose main purpose seems to be verbally  physically assaulting as many cast members as possible. I had a hard time believing that anyone would even attempt to work with this person in any capacity he is nothing but rude and abusive to everyone, including his girlfriend and his buddy. Regardless, the kids are visited by local character  annual pumpkincarving champion Pumpkin Jack, an elderly coot who is described as the Santa Claus of Halloween, and who drops off a load of props for the house, including an ominous book that figured prominently in the irritatingly strobeflashed prologuewhere a gaggle of robed cultists get turned into stirfry. Needless to say, some damn fool starts messing with the book, and eventually most of the costumed monsters turn into real ones, and the remaining few normal folk have to try and survive. There is some good stuff in this film, but not much everything is shot well, and the makeup effects are decent. On the other hand, the performers either underact, or overact drastically; much of the plot makes little sense outside of a this happens so that can happen series; there is hardly any musical score to speak of, just snatches of songs throughout the film; and the movie takes an hour to actually get anywhere.

If Mr. Hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience, perhaps he would have cut 75 or the walkingrunningstrolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutes.Film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is good enough can truly be.

It was obvious from the opening shots this was not a real movie, not even a Bmovie. It is more in the category of the DeCoteau horror movies like The Brotherhood that are shot on filmlook video for about 50 cents in fact, I was half afraid any minute one of his beefy college boys would stagger out rubbing himself in his underpants or something. There were no cutaway shots too expensive to do multiple camera setups and flat lighting but...it is hard to pinpoint. There is something refreshing about watching a director with no money pull off a halfdecent movie. The fact that he is doing even a halfdecent job is commendable, and this movie has it is share of meritsthe acting is not bad, the photography is pretty good if too bright to be scary, there are some surprises, and the whole thing is sort of...different somehow.A bunch of college kids are for some unknown reason stuck in the warehouse where they are decorating the annual haunted house. A creepy old man gives them a satanic book and they accidentally summon up the powers of hell. This results in the costumed people in the haunted house becoming who they are made up to be, and causing a lot of mayhem and human suffering. Along the way we are treated to an oddly complex and thoughtful lesbian relationship subplotit is interesting that this couple seems to be the most wellrounded in the movie. Yes, there is a sex scene but it is not salaciousor at least no more so than you would find in any legit movie about lesbians that shows them having sex. It is rather unusual for a horror film to take the time and effort to do this without resorting to cheap exploitation. The other thing about this that held my interest was how it was clearly trying to emulate the stupid kids have sex and get killed vibe of the 80s slashers. It is hard to take that on because there are so many of those films that already exist, the genre has been done to death. I am not sure if it is good or bad that these filmmakers simply tried to make another entry in that genre, without irony, as if it was still a LIVING genre, but I appreciated the attempt.Which is why I sat through it; sometimes you just want to watch a mindless, nobudget, Aforeffort horror film. There really was too much set up, not enough gore, endless plotholes, deadends and clich\u00e9s and the unfortunate overall feel of a movie that simply did not have enough money behind it to be the film the producers envisioned...but at the very least the haunted house scenes were pretty cool. I would pay to go to that haunted house if it existed, and did not mind paying a dollar to see it on DVD even if I will never watch this again.Oh, and possible spoiler, but there was great, brief business with the vampire girl in the coffin I used to be claustrophobic. But I have changed. Ha ha, good one.","label":0},{"index":9746,"txt":"Wow...where to begin...picked this up at Big Lots for only 2.99. That is three bucks I will never see again...ever...and for what? I will tell ya. An hour and fifteen minutes of boring, boring, boring chat and college angst that seemed more suitable for a Lifetime movie than the horror flick advertised on the box. May the marketing droids who designed it burn in Hell for all eternity. Follow that up with a little bit of cheap gore not even good gore mind you... and a plot twist at the end that comes out of nowhere, and makes no sense. Awful, awful, awful...Was there any redeeming qualities? Well, on the Joe Bob Briggs scale, there WERE six breasts involved, but that is hardly worth my long lost three bucks.

I do not wish to argue with their opinion, but I strongly disagree. When I first watched this film I was mildly impressed. But after comparing it with other films, particularly with the late master, Bruce Lee I quickly changed my mind. In fact, if it was not for the title of the film, I would never have bought it. Game of Death 2 does not relate to the original Game of Death, except it shares one character, Billy Lo.I was stunned to see how similar Game of Death 2 was compared to Enter the Dragon. The plots have striking similarities Both Bruce Lee and Bobby Lo are on a mission to avenge a relative. The two locations are similar, in which they both are very isolated and are surrounded by thousands of Blackbelts. There is an element of prostitution in both films women are sent two the guests rooms in both films. Both Han Enter the Dragon and Lewiss henchman have a hand missing. Their is an underground drug operation in Enter the Dragon, believe it or not, there is one in Game of Death 2. Han has a pet cat in Enter the Dragon, the director has used his imagination and awarded Lewis with a pet monkey! The list continues. Regarding other aspects of the film, such as the script and the acting, I felt it was very poor. It seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists to star in the film and prayed they could act. On a positive scale, I cannot deny that the choreography is impressive. Although the fighting sequences have strong elements of acrobatics in them, they are none the less skillfully performed. However, as the plot is insufficient, i could not relate to the characters, therefore the fighting sequences were more exhibitions rather than having a meaning to the film. In conclusion I would say this film is recommendable to any martialarts fans, but for those who enjoy a solid action film, with a good storyline and strong characters, I seriously would not recommend this film. My opinions towards this film may seem very bias and onesided, but when Bruce Lee set a new standard in the martial arts cinema, particularly after his masterpiece Enter the Dragon, this film failed to rise to these standards. If anything they imitated a truly brilliant martialarts film, in hope of achieving the same level of fame. In reference to my evaluation, awarding this film a very harsh 1 out of 10, the film is barley watchable, and must be thankful that it had the fighting sequences it did.","label":0},{"index":9749,"txt":"In this sequel Bruce is still called Billy Lo get it? Bruce Billy, Lo Lee. No? But apart from that, that is all it has in common with the other movie. Billy does not seem to be an actor anymore. He seems to be in another country. He is more like a spy. He is the only cast member to return and sadly, they kill him off to make way for a new character, his brother, Bobby. Sadly, when Bruce dies, the movie pretty much dies with him. This was extremely poorly made. It seemed like they were writing the script as they were filming. The footage works for a while it is not too obvious at first but soon Bruce is always shown in the dark all the time he kicks out a light at one stage for no other apparent reason to hide the fact that it is not Bruce playing the part. Sadly when he dies the movie changes. I cannot help but wonder if they were filming as they were writing and may well have planned to keep Bruce alive, but later decided to kill him off because it would not have been plausible as Bobby does not appear until Billy is dead. It is hard to change the lead character halfway in the movie and Bruce is a hard act to follow so it is hard to now accept Bobby as the star. Bruce is never seen again in this movie. I think they should have made this sequel without Bruce he has a lame role in this movie. People hoping to see a new Bruce Lee movie will be disappointed to see that although he is given the top billing, he only has a featuring role. Even the worst movies have at least one memorable bit. If there was one bit about this movie people seem to talk about, it is the scene where Billy fights in a plant nursery. Ironically it does not even use Bruce Lee footage. Mind you, they did it more convincingly in No Retreat No Surrender. Not one of the other actors here ever made anything else memorable. Bruces girlfriend Colleen Camp is never mentioned. My advice is to turn it off as soon as Bruce is finished writing his letter to his brother. Nothing else in the movie is worth watching. I found it really sad to see Bruce die. I do not see how a small budgeted movie like this could get enough money to use footage from Enter The Dragon. This was a cheap way of trying to cash in on Bruces name. Oddly this and the original are credited in Bruces filmography. Thankfully so far, no one has tried anything like this again. 1981 was the year of Bruces last movie appearance. It was a sad way to end it, but thankfully this is proof that Bruces movie career should be left alone.","label":0},{"index":9750,"txt":"This is high grade cheese fare of B movie kung fu flicks.

You will laugh in awe at how the film splicing is not very good, but some cool deleted scenes from Enter the Dragon are thrown in the mix. According to the movie, Bruce Lee was killed by a dart while hanging from a helicopter. Of course, they think this can excuse Bruce Li for trying to be Bruce even though his character is supposed to be Bruces brother who for some reason still mimes Bruces gestures and fighting style  very POORLY. See Bruce go oneonone with the cowardly lion. The props department stopped by KayBee, you see. Bruce also finds nothing wrong with savagely beating up a crippled man.

At times, it felt like I was watching a sequel to Kung Pow rather than a Bruce Lee film.To be honest, this film has bugger all to do with Game of Death. If anything, it is more a sequelremake of Enter the Dragon, incorporating many elements of that film  particularly the actual footage. Bruce Lees character Billy Lo apparently investigates the sudden death of his friend and encounters a piece of film that was left with the mans daughter. When the body is stolen during the funeral !, Billy is also killed and it is up to his wayward brother to avenge both mens deaths.Tong Long stars as brother Bobby Lo and does not really have the sort of charisma to carry the film. His fighting abilities are very good however. Bruce Lee obviously turns up thanks to no longer deleted footage simply to cashin on the legacy. Saying that, on the whole, the footage is actually editedin better than in Game of Death but it does not stop the film from being a mess.OK, so the fights are actually very entertaining dare I say mindblowing and make the film at least watchable. But there are so many daft elements to this film that it really tests your patience. First off, there is the supposed villain who lives on his palatial estate... or is that mental institution? Seriously, the nutter eats raw venison, drinks deers blood, carries a monkey on his shoulder and owns some peacocks and lions ?!. This attempt to make him look tough and intelligent just makes you feel sorry for him  you half expect someone to escort him back to his room.In fact, this middle section is awful and when the scene involving a naked hooker and a lion suit arrived I turned it off. However, I did finish the film and was kind of glad I did because the fight scene towards the end much like GOD was the whole reason for watching. While the story is an embarrassment, the action is very good and contains excellent choreography.But even the finale disappoints if the premise was anything to go by. What we were told was that the Tower of Death was a pagoda that was upside down and underground. This sounded great, like a twist on Bruce Lees original idea with different styles of fighting on each level. Could this be the Game of Death that was originally planned? No! The film should have been named Generator Room of Death because thats as far as the tower goes. Of yes, there were indeed one or two different styles... there were foil clad grunts, leopardskinned henchman and stupid monk. It is as though Enter the Dragon had never been made, with the plot being a poor imitation.Worth watching once for the fast paced fight scenes, but so stupid sometimes that it hurts. If this was intended, then fine. Thumbs up, however, for recreating that projector room scene from Enter The Dragon.","label":0},{"index":9752,"txt":"This is even worse than the original Game of Death. A jumbled, incoherent storyline leads to Billy Lo falling from a helicopter to the ground below, killing him, as we are left to follow his younger brother, Bobby Lo. So not only do we start out following some Bruce Lee clone, the film kills that one off and has us follow another one thirty minutes into the story. The main reason to watch this one is when Bobby Lo fights a lion, which is quite obviously a guy in a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain, who is usually pretty awesome but his screen time is significantly small. Mainly watched this and the original Game of Death because they are a part of the Bruce Lee boxed set. It is no wonder they are included with Lees finished works. No one would buy them otherwise.","label":0},{"index":9753,"txt":"Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this film still is probably one of the worst films ever made. It has Bruce Lee die as the result of falling off a helicopter after being hit by some kind of a ninja knife to the back of the neck but it does not explain how he came to be on a helicopter since the prior scene has him near but not on the helicopter which is already 200 feet in the air. It just gets downright absurd from then, like something out of a cheap comic book. Maybe the idea is not so rotten but it is not done with any degree of artistry from a film making point of view. There are dozens of such martial arts bombers out there, usually all made in Hong Kong. I think that Jean Claude van Dam improved the genre with adding plausible stories in his films and having film makers who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagals films are way better than 90 percent of the martial arts junk movies made during the 1970s and early 1980s in Hong Kong. Game of Death II falls into the category of junk cinema in my opinion, despite Bruce Lee being in it.","label":0},{"index":9754,"txt":"Is it possible to give a movie NO STARS? I suppose not. However many stars IMDb displays this just think zero and you will get my drift. Director and photographer Timothy Hines did not have much of a budget compared to Spielbergs Herculean effort with the same material rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made, but that need not be an insurmountable handicap. I have seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring Soldier and Saints is a recent example. With hard work, integrity and, above all, talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of Wells novella  and at fraction of what was spent by Dreamworks on its War of the Worlds. Unfortunately, Hines failed in all these departments. Even if he had had Spielbergs budget and Tom Cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal he is foisted on us.Primarily, Hines seems unable to tell a story. Thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound, but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records. A guy walks down a country lane, a lot. He talks badly aped Received English to some other guy. Then he walks down the same lane, only shot from the back this time to show he is returning  clever, eh? Walking and talking, for nearly an hour that is all that happens. OK, I will grant that one extended excursion from the main characters house to the impact site on Horsell Common to show that it is a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful a firstyear film student could storyboard a more economical and more aesthetical establishing sequence than this, btw, but half a dozen times? Back and forth, back and forth, et cetera, et cetera with some yakkityyak in between. Remarkable. The only explanation for this surfeit of redundancy other than total artistic ineptitude is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of wretchedly amateurish CG works into something that could be offered as a featurelength film. Finally the Martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking, or shrieking. Later we get staggering and wailing for dessert.Thankfully, much of the dialogue is lifted straight from H.G. Wells text; else we would have no idea what is going on. But is it not the whole point of cinema to illuminate a text, to realize what words alone cannot convey? If a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel, why bother? Why not do a radio play? Orson Welles made himself a household name doing just that. However, Hines thinks he is a filmmaker, so he is content to mouth the words and swallow the meaning.Secondly, Hines was able to buy some CG effects of a sort for his movie, but he has no idea how to use them. Now I for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy. I believe good science fiction cinema does not need dazzling technical effects. Some really potent SciFis have flourished on virtually none at all. But The War of the Worlds as film requires a certain baseline effort. Wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled. The effects do not need to be complex; they can even be crude e.g. fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the George PalByron Haskins 1953 version, but they must be handled well. Unfortunately Hines effects are both crude and incompetent \u0096 tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum \u0096 Martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort \u0096 skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream  the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times flipped left for right occasionally in hope that we might not notice \u0096 and on ad nauseum. Crude technique is forgivable. So you have a CG fire effect that is less than convincing? Fine, we can work around that. Just do not use it too often and only show glimpses of it. That stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum? Throw it away. It is not necessary. You say your Martian flyer looks like a toy on a string? If you must use it, go ahead, but please do not show it twice! But no, Hines will not listen. We get the worst looking stuff used again and again. Gotta get those 180 minutes somehow, boy.Next we have acting, or more precisely too much acting. Whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out. Evidently Hines thinks he is getting a bargain  More fleeing in terror over there! You, quaking behind that tree, let us have a real conniption fit this take. You call that writhing in agony? Nonsense, my grandmother can writhe better  Nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink. They are not even good amateurs. But this need not prove fatal. Many a good movie has been made with rancid acting. That is what directors are for. And editors. Which brings up another point\u0085 Who the hell let Tim Hines edit this cheese factory? If Americas butchers were as adept at meat cutting as Hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef. In spite of the near threehour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie  not sequences, but single frames, creating a herkyjerky effect that is nauseating to watch. Maybe Hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890s.

Most characters appear to live aimless, unstructured lives, held together by their professional commitments. It also stretches credibility that a man who has just been given what amounts to a likely death sentence, would cheerfully indulge in a sex romp with a woman he has just met.

This is the job of television, not cinema. The location of the train station was well chosen and I enjoyed Sascha Horlers performance as the pregnant friend. I felt as though Justine Clarkes performance was wan. Her reactions to things felt forced, as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonists expressions. I also cannot believe that a director can make the wonderful Daniela Farinacci into an unbelievable presence. I cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences. This is a lazy device, especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film andor where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest. That said, there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the Australian heat and local attitude with originality. It does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine. Especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity, infusing it with passion and handcrafted charm. I am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked. Who knows if there is a god? Like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do or whatever the line was.

And no anime movie better represents this division between otakus and people with actual taste than this elegant piece of trash, Fatal Fury the Motion Picture. As seen through the glassy, witless eyes of an otaku, there is little to find fault with in Fatal Fury there is plenty of quirky Japanesey humor, oneonone duels, some dramatic moments, and everything is beautifully drawn. But everyone else will be turned off by the cliched, predictable plot with cliched, predictable characters, culminating in a cliched, predictable ending. The love scenes are hilariously overblown the scene in which Sulia heals Terry is obviously intended to be a tender moment, but it is virtually impossible to not be thrown into spirals of giddy laughter by the sheer ludicrousness of it. And of course, Fatal Fury is not without the obligatory cartoon TA this is supplied gratuitously by the hugebreasted Mai Shiranui. And since Fatal Fury IS based off the video game series of the same name oh boy, we are treated to numerous pointless cameo appearances by popular characters with little or no relevance to the plot whatsoever they go through all the trouble of introducing Kim early on, only for him to disappear from the movie totally after that point. This mess of a movie reaches its climax with the unintentionally farcical final battle, in which all the main characters engage the allpowerful main villain in oneonone combat in turn. That is some thing that is always amused me... even when battles in animes Are not taking place in a tournament, they always happen as if they were, regardless of the fact that it makes no sense whatsoever! Otakus always rave about how anime movies should be treated as MOVIES as opposed to merely cartoons, and a disturbing portion of those same people love Fatal Fury. So would Fatal Fury have been good if it was not an anime? The answer is an emphatic no all of this movies charm, what little of it there is, resides in the actual drawings. Had Fatal Fury not been an anime, it would have been worthy of an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, if the show was still on the air. That is the key this is nothing more than a laughably bad Bmovie in the guise of an anime epic. If you are a fan of movies so bad that they are actually entertaining, consider renting Fatal Fury or catch it on the SciFi channel, as it is definitely one of those.

I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie, like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where Cage is looking for the girl, has a hallucination, followed by another hallucination, followed by a dream sequence with a hallucination, etc., but it is just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this. Instead, heres five reasons why you SHOULD watch The Wicker Man, even though it is bad 5. It is hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it, the only problem is in its cheesy, unintentionally funny execution. If nothing else, this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film, or even read the short story on which it is based.4. For a cheesy horrorthriller, it is really aesthetically pleasing. It is pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets, so we get to see some very great scenery. There are also many nicely composed shots. It is a very good looking movie.3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature. Whether you are a fan of his or not, it seems as if it is impossible for Cage to play a normal guy. There is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays, and personally, I am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does. Whether Nicolas Cage is great or terrible, he always brings his unique energy into play, and he is never boring to watch. He is terrible in The Wicker Man, but in the most wonderful kind of way.2. A student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie, as it seems to be the strongest antifeminist movie ever made. See? you could write, this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society! Also, the similarities between this Summersisle society and a bee colony are pretty interesting and worth noting.1. If you are reading this, there is probably a good chance you may have seen a YouTube video that has become very popular a collection of highlights from the movie, including Cage running around in a bear suit, and of course, the infamous AAGHH!! THE BEES!! MY EYES!!! line. These scenes are hilarious out of context, and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the films entirety.I bought the used DVD at Blockbuster for about 5 dollars...when you work that out, it is about a dollar per reason.

It finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for Edward.Overall, not a well written story and too long. FINAL VERDICT I would skip this.","label":0},{"index":9768,"txt":"This movie is suppose to be a mysterious, serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. However, 30 minutes into the movie, it turns into a funny, unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. I cannot imagine anyone not laughing when Cage randomly Karate kicks that blonde girl or when he bear punches that old lady. The lines, characters, and acting are all poorly done from the getgo. I have always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he has made some terrible movies this year; this being by far the worst one yet....I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense storygripping thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, go rent the original. However, if you intend on watching it, get ready to laugh at some of the lines and end scenes rather than taking them seriously; that is the only way you enjoy this film.","label":0},{"index":9769,"txt":"A trooper is on the side of the road making sure every1 is obeying the speed limit doing his job; he then pulls over a woman who appears she is a mother there is a child in the back seat; he then is telling her what is wrong and BAM...they get killed. Okay, this is the start of what i personally thought would have been a good movie. When I was watching this movie in the theatre I was with some friends. This was our first night out after the summer so we wanted to go and see a good movie. We all decided to see a suspensethriller that looked good to everyone in the group...this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. Not only did I waste 7.oo on a movie ticket, but I had to sit through torture for the brain. This movie started off with mystery and suspense and I seriously thought this cant be bad...I was so wrong. The whole problem with this movie is that it makes no sense; even if you can get passed the bad acting, the not so scary storyline, and the over all horrible mess this movie was, you will still be puzzled. It is not because you are not smart enough to understand it, it is because no human with a brain could comprehend what this stupid movie is about. Right now you may be thinking Oh man! I have to watch this movie just to see if it is as bad as this person says it is. GET THAT THOUGHT OUT OF YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW!!! I am trying to save you the trouble of watching this movie by telling you that it is so bad that there is no point in even considering seeing it. Please people do not make the same mistake i did thinking that this movie has potential...it does not. I give this movie 1 out of 10 if I could give a zero I would, and I do not recommend anyone to ever see this movie, you will be saving yourself many sleepless nights trying to think w.t.f. that freaking movie is about.","label":0},{"index":9770,"txt":"First this movie was not that bad.It was entertaining...at least to me for probably all the wrong reasons. I have never seen the original so cannot compare the two.This movie reminded me of that weird Christopher Reeve movie Village of the Damned. THe two movies have different plots, but that creepy disgusted feeling and unwanted comedy exist in both.The wicker man is suppose to be a mysterythrillermen please do not anger the women movie. I do not know the whole pagan thing and sacrifice was a little off.Nicholas Cage, his glorious bad self goes to a secluded Island called Summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long lost fianc\u00e9e who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by fellow islanders. Cage is a police officer and being the weary policeman he is he goes to the semi uncharted island leaving no word of his whereabouts to anyone who is located in the real world. Stupid.Things get weirder when the large Amishesquire women who populate the island snarl at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl. His fianc\u00e9e is no help who seems to be elusive and weary the whole time. Cage stays on the Island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the lucky man tricked to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the islands sick harvest festival.In this movie males do not fare so well. A sick twisted display of feminism? I found the movie laughable at times particularly when cage punches some women and runs around in a bear suit. I think there were too many potholes in this movie. I find the whole concept of angry women secluding themselves on an island without any care for males quite entertaining, but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird. While most women have had some jerk hurt and anger them this is clearly a form of sexism. I would have turned the movie off in disgust if the roles were reversed. This movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice. It is NOT a thriller it should be categorized as just strange.","label":0},{"index":9771,"txt":"It is unfortunate that you cannot go any lower than one star. Prior to watching The Wicker Man, I had considered Aliens 3 to be the only movie that would actually merit negative stars. In all fairness, The Wicker Man does not detract from the enjoyment of an earlier film, but the fact remains that my cumulative movie enjoyment has been reduced by seeing it.There is a cheap trick all too often used in Hollywood when the producers are too stingy to hire good writers or in too much of a hurry to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfactory conclusion slap in a shocker ending and hope that the public will mistake it for something artistic or meaningful. It is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case manages only to splatter embarrassment on a fine actor and ridicule upon the producers. Even more so in that the carefully crafted or however they put it conclusion did not seem to follow logically from the plot which naturally I cannot elaborate on without introducing spoilers, and instead negates what merit the plot had up to that point.It is a film that might logically appeal to psychopaths, pedophiles, and possibly diehard Nicholas Cage fans, but only to a few of the mainstream audience. If you really want something along these lines, I heartily recommend M. Night Shyamalans The Village instead.

The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This film does not fall under any of those and just remains dumb.I just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point , but it never does.

I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the rerelease of The Excorcist\u0085 really nervous laughter. It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl. In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however, it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character, Scuzzlebut, the friendly forest monster with TVs Patrick Duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who is favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets.3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film. I started laughing and my friend Keith got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor. I just did not think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers I was right. Gone is the realness, the outstanding original music, the originality, the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue. Instead we have horror movie clich\u00e9s, affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart. Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground playing Wickerman.The original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison. In the new spin a California cop Cage is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his exgirlfriend to find her missing daughter. She sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago. The crash still haunts him in part because the girls body was never found. Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north, alone, to help his exgirlfriend find her daughter. He arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of Wiccans, many of whom seem like they did not get call backs for roles in The Village. And like The Village it is not long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here. Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison.I think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry. I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks. We needed a bad remake of the Wickerman like we needed yet another 911 movie. I am starting to wonder if Nicolas changed his surname from Coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so.","label":0},{"index":9775,"txt":"If Edward Woodward was the the flicks watching this film then that is what he would scream out in horror. I am sorry folks but enoughs enough. We had Get Carter, The Italian Job, Alfie and now this. What is the similarities? No. It is not exactly a coincidence that three of the originals star Maurice Micklewhite and the other stars another great British actor. The main common ingredient in those originals IS the britishness of the films. They were not made to impress Hollywood. They were quirky English films with a unique charmatmosphere that just cannot be replicated in the USA. The word is CULT and what better way to destroy a cult film than to bastardise it with a remake or even a sequel. Wicker 06 had a tough task before it even hit the road. Wicker 73 is even more enigmatic that other said cult films; it defies genre, intelligent scripts, Agrade actors, the music score, setpieces that defy description and all the stories surrounding the film.So here comes a remake. Do not worry. No originals were harmed in the making of this remake. Some major aspects of the story needed to be reworked for the modern USA  communications, paganism, virgins. But that is just about the whole premise. So we give the cop a Nam style trauma past complete with shock music flashbacks for the cheap scares. Then with no mobile phone mast on the island that sorts the communication out  but in the real world this would not happen. Cops just do not go missing. Give him a blood link for motivation rather than the clash of beliefs and you have the remake. Wafer thin though, is not it?It is just that it was all laid on with a trowel. The name alterations were simply hammy, almost Carry On, there was no sense of community on the island, no centre of town to catch your bearings, just a few houses dotted about a forest and that was it. Willow was just annoying by not giving out any info at all and Cage was useless to let her get away with it. When he went into the well you just knew he would get locked it. The screenplay was signposted all the way to the end  and you just wanted it to hurry up and end. The epilogue was absolutely hilarious and did not know when to stop. That ending is probably the best way to summarise the difference between the two. One ends in the most beautiful sunset after the most horrific day. The other ends with a postproduction explainitalltothethickies type conclusion.I loved the original but went to the cinema with an open mind and was excited to see the film.

Which leaves you with the walking. And boy, does this film do walking! If Mr Piano had his way, this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the Wisconsin countryside, but every 40 minutes or so these pesky Martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble. You have never seen so much walking in a movie. If this really had a 20m budget, most of it must have gone on Mr Pianos shoes, because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does. Which explains why there is no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera or proper actors. Honestly, it is like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes. Even on fastforward, this is a looonnnggg walk.As for the scifi stuff, I think it was a mistake to put Martians in the film they only get in the way of the walking, which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story.I wonder how much Mr Piano charges to walk dogs?","label":0},{"index":9777,"txt":"OK, so I am an original Wicker Man fan and I usually do not like British films remade by Americans, so why oh why did I put myself through the most painful cinema experiences ever?

The bit at the beginning with the crashfire had no relevance to the film at all and the female cop knew where Edward was going, so the bit at the end with the two girls visiting the mainland, well it would not have happened as the whole thing would have been investigated. The history behind the wicker man was not really explored  and I guess being set in America did not really help the whole pagan theme. This film was slow and contained no atmosphere or suspense.

Sure it might sound sort of cheeky ominous line to intrigue you but the sacrifice will be all on the audience side of the screen.

That is not a joke nor is it fictional. I have never been to a thriller and heard so much laughter through out the entire film. I cannot tell you with an certainty if the laughs were intentional in some effort to lighten the cinematic tension or if they just really thought this crud would actual fly. I honestly found myself routing for a power outage or a perhaps a fight to break out in the movie theater, anything to make this more interesting which is pretty sad since Deez, Powder and I pounded 2 beers each before the film just for a little mental anesthesia soon to be a law before all Nic Cage films, write to your congressman today, do not delay.

It is actually hilariously awful.First off...Nicholas Cage must now have made it to the finals in the OverEmoting Category in his acting class. Wearing new hair plugs and with a face that has been lifted so many times his pinned back ears seem to be straining to touch in the back he oozes not only a sick smarmiess but creates a hero character that you have no vested interest in.I do not know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters. He makes females out to be totally deviant and evil...and pays them back by having Cage punch several of them directly in the face and call them all bes a few times too. I have enjoyed LaButes early films and a few of his plays...but it is a strange fascination he has.I would give this film a 2 out of 10 solely based on Ellen Burstyns performance. By the time she finally makes her appearance bravely soldiering through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead it seems like all hope may be lost. She deserves an Oscar right here and now for saying her lines with a straight face and when she appears wearing a white mumu and blue, white, and gold face paint booming about The Wicker Man you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin really prepped her for this role dang well.This movie is so wrongheaded and cuckoo that is has to be seen to be believed.Highlights include Nicholas Cage running away from a swarm of bees and then falling down a hill.Nicholas Cage stealing a bicycle and looking like Ms. Gulch from The Wizard of Oz riding around on it.Nicholas Cage running around the island kicking down doors looking for the missing girl.Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING from a oncepromising acting career in a brawl with Cage.Ellen Burstyn dancing around in a said while mumu.Nicholas Cage screaming Who burned it?

I was not going to comment, but the film just bugs me so much, and the writerdirector in particular. So I must toss in my hat to join the naysayers.I saw the original Wicker Man and really loved the cornucopia of music, sensuality, paganism in a modern world, and the clash of theological beliefs. This said, I am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies should not be done. For example, I liked the original 1950s Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake. Both films can stand on their own. Another example is The Thing. The original, as campy as it looks compared to todays standards, has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with Kurt Russell my all time favorite horror movie. So that small minority of people who like The Wicker Man remake can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because it is a remake.This film solidified for me Neil LaButes sexism and misogynistic tendencies. It also made me wonder how executives, wanting to make a serious thriller, would green light a product that is so antifemale. There are too many scenes of Cage hitting women just because he is frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl. would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects are not forthcoming? The original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a Goddess based religion. The threat to the main character came from everyone, male and female. There was no sexual hierarchy.The metaphor of bees, drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient The drone must die!, especially when Cages character has bee allergies. I kept wondering why the men on the island did not fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts. These were not women with special supernatural powers, and half of them seemed to be pregnant, the other half old and fat, and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs, so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women. Physically dominate them. There did not seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy. But if they were content being drones, why make them unable to speak? They could be used as a threat to Cage because they will defend the community. They are drones because Neil LaBute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated. That movie was made already. The Stepford Wives anyone? Classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sht together and were truly equal citizens.The problem with the manhating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when Cage starts knocking women out. I belief LaBute should have left the society an egalitarian one, kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness, and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island. No one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited. So how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around? There would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused, thus, an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children. LaBute has said he created the fianc\u00e9 and daughter story thread to give Cages character an incentive to search. I do not think you need that. Any child abused will make an adult react to save them. The irony of course would be that the child Cage saves ultimately brings him death.The dialogue was contrived and campy. The whole third act was hilarious. The audience I saw it with guffawed and later booed at the end. I just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded Cage is. We do not need that. Just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child. Most of us in America have seen Law  Order and other cop procedurals. We come into the movie as if we are Cages partner solving a mystery.So much potential...wasted. Neil LaBute, stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angstridden plays and flicks of that sort. Stay with your own company of men. Leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers. Here is your jar of honey. I will watch that.","label":0},{"index":9784,"txt":"This film was terrible. OK, my favourite film is The Wicker Man 1973, so I was always bound to be a little biased. The plot rambles along, throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term remake highly dubious. He is not a virgin, but IS allergic to bees. WOW! So many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained, which I am afraid Mr LaBute does not a horror movie make. How are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film? Cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout, and his character is prone to calling out Rowan!? at the slightest noise. The nods to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage. For example, certain incidents mirror the original The girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when WoodwardCage is searching the island and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from Anthony Schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in.I am sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this, I really cannot be bothered to write any more about this film.

The Nicholas Cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations.

I figure I blew 6 bux on the VHS, might as well suffer for it. I remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for War of the Worlds cause of the rumors of the Spielberg movie at the time, and I missed the old TV series from the early 90s. The website make it out that this was a multimillion dollar budget rendition of the classic book. It was going to be a perfect translation. Perfect CRAP is more in tune with this film.First off, the video on this movie was glitched! It looked as if I was watching the Full Motion Video from an old mid90s PC or Playstation CDRom video game. Sadly enough, the color quality was similar. The acting made Shatners classic dramatic pause look damn near Shakespearean in quality. The CG rendering of various scenes was horrendous, and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old Dukes of Hazardd scenes.Secondly, it is slow and terribly drawn out. I sat thru 45 minutes of the video no promos at the beginning before the cylinder actually Opened to reveal the first alien. After that, the alien was a terribly constructed CG squid. I am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry I have seen is a spinning silver disk crappy down even attached to a mechanical arm. The dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumentals. The last thing on that, for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900s NO ONE is concerned for their life. It is like they have no concept. Even though media was slow, word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known. The illusion of day and night was shoddy at best. Simply changing the color around the people to purple, blue or green does not signify NIGHT TIME. Perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a MUCH better illusion. THere is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the hero gallop around or walk down silly roads. Get on with the film. I know how people get around, you do NOT need to be so indepth.Now, finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers had better looking effects. Even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student. The animations do NOT match up to the scenery at all.In closing folks, if you want The War of the Worlds, do one of four things. 1 Watch the 1953 original, 2 watch the early 90s TV series, 3 wait for Spielbergs rendition to be released shortly, OR 4 Read the frikkin book something we all probably did in elementary English class.

There were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous I began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it was not. The acting was absolutely dreadful. I like Nicholas Cage but this was a miss. Without exception, every performance in this movie was incredibly below average. The cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique. Finally, the story is completely transparent.

I am like, come on! You may not like the new one, but if that is your favorite soundtrack, I do not know if I want you to like my film. Neil, a word. You might want to sit down for this too; as Lord Summerisle says, shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent. See, Neil, the thing about the original, is that Paul Giovannis soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it. The filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical. Along with Richard and Danny Thompson, and Bert Jansch, it practically kickstarted the 1970s Folk New Wave. To undermine it is akin to imagining Jaws without John Williams. Or The Buddy Holly Story without Buddy Holly. The results one of the most breathtakingly arrogant, pointless remake of a British cult classic since Sly Stallones Get Carter.The original had apparently left Nicolas Cage disturbed for about two weeks. So disturbed, during that fortnights window, that he pitched the idea of reimagining one of the most nuanced films about interfaith struggle ever devised to a writerdirector previously known for his wholly unsubtle depictions of male chauvinism. It is like some parlor game what would you get if Sam Peckinpah took on Bambi? Or Gaspar Irreversible Noe remade Love, Actually?Actually, I would quite like to see that. Unfortunately, someone took this parlor game seriously All LaButes succeeded in doing is ripping out the originals guts while saddling it with his own gormless Sex War preoccupations.After failing to rescue a little girl and her mum from a fatal car crash, Cages highway patrolman spirals into a medicated torpor. Then he receives a letter from exfianc\u00e9e Willow Woodward this one trades on namehomages for kudos, now living on the private island community of Summersisle \u0096 that extra s stands for superfluous \u0096 and wants Edward to help locate missing daughter Rowan.Summersisle, it transpires, is a femaledominated joint, conceived as a haven for oppressed womenfolk and refugees from the Salem witch trials. Here, the matriarchs observe the Olde ways, and the few males are nearmute breedmules. It is like Lilith Fair on a grand scale. Summersisles main export is honey \u0096 a symbolic and literal headache for Edward, as he is allergic to bees. Beekeepers! cries Edward. They seem to be everywhere on this island! Well, that is probably because Summersisles main export is honey.While making his investigations, Edward overhears of an oncoming Mayday ritual called the time of death and rebirth. He discovers the previous years crop failed; nearly dies from bee stings; and eventually comes to the conclusion a conclusion which admittedly could not be more obvious if the locals had tattooed a timetable of events on the back of his hands that Rowan will be burnt alive in a pagan rite to ensure a bountiful harvest. He also meets the Queen Bee of the hive, Sister Summersisle Burstyn, who has her own plans for him involving the eponymous Wicker Man The drone must die. First, the good news any concerns Cage would be airlifted from the Wicker Mans flaming jaws at the last minute by a fleet of black CIA helicopters can be laid to rest he toast. That is about it for the good news. This is a story whose chapters were carefully written intones Burstyn with sublime irony. Though retaining the basic catandmouse premise and credits typography, what is left subjects the original to a scorchedearth policy.Crucial to Shaffers original screenplay was that his Christian copper, in accordance with ritual, came to the island of his own free will \u0096 and most importantly, was a virgin; the perfect sacrifice. In reducing matters to a sexual, as opposed to a religious powerstruggle, LaBute presents the flimsiest of qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice. By the time Cage has worked out he was the bait, you honestly could not care less.And Cage is one of the very worst things in this; a lumbering, drawling donkey \u0096 an arsewit whose tongue seems just slightly too big for his mouth. Goddamit he moans after he hallucinates a drowned Rowan, with all the mental torment of a man who is set his morning alarm clock halfanhour too early. One hopes it is his characters frequent reliance on pills that has reduced him to this state \u0096 alternately fatigued, then full of preppy, overbearing vim. If so, it is a fine portrayal of an undistinguished IQ addled with antidepressants. If not\u0085it does not bear thinking about. As Willow, the saucereyed Beahan is similarly dreadful, presenting her lines as if in competition with Cage for the\u0085most\u0085halfhearted\u0085delivery. While Burstyn entirely lacks the mercurial menace to convince. Who is afraid of Naomi Wolf? Every element that made the original great \u0096 the lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs, the ingenious score, the dialogue Lord Summerisles majestic You did it beautifully! has been replaced with the rather less attractive You did it excellently! Whoah, dude! \u0096 have been substituted for a meandering battleofthesexes thriller with occasional crashbang wallop. Namely, walloping women; this is a LaBute flick, after all. Cages Sister Beech bashing is just one of the more embarrassing episodes; impotent little men will be hooting with glee at how them uppity hippie chicks finally got what was comin to em, hyuk hyuk.The closing coda sees the whole rotten mess collapsing under the weight of genre clich\u00e9 in a bar, two guys run into a couple of Summersisle maidens on shore leave, flirtyfishing for fresh martyrs. At the moment of their successful pickup, you half expect the women to turn round and give an exaggerated wink and a thumbs up to the camera.One more thing keen credit watchers may have noticed that films sporting an unusually high producer count anything up to 10 tend to be Not Much Cop.

Either, I have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent, I feel that the publics perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons, or I believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers. While all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative, I find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as, This is one of the best films of all time!, does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides, nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good, which should be the point of the review in the first place. With that being said, War of the Worlds is nothing more than a hurried, incompetent attempt at a money grab; piggybacking its loathsome carcass on the multimillion dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by Steven Spielberg. Many people will buy this DVD in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject. This movie is not even so bad that it becomes funny or endearing, rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger. Now with most of the insults out of the way, allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than I. Judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film I found it as SAMs Club for 8 bucks, I assumed that the cast would be nonames and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular. Check. This is not a big deal for me, as I find a large budget and an overreliance on big name stars and SE can diminish an otherwise decent movie. I also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score. Check again. What I did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alienbattle scenes. Now, as per IMDbs policy any spoilers must be announced in advance, no matter how small, so here is fair warning. The movie opens with a lot of inane smalltalk, followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot. Seriously, it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube. It is very hard to describe every little issue in depth, but by the end of the first ten minutes, the combination of shaky camerawork, spliced scenes, and a LOT of walking begin to frustrate the viewer. However, the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going. The next 30 minutes basically go as follows one of the main characters walks to one of the pods, he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot. They both walk back to town. These walks are not two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged. They are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie. In a particularly grueling scene, the main character is shown looking at a pod, then he is shown pacing and panting, then he looks at the pod, then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town, then comes in to town and walks into a building, then he has a cup of coffee and says Thank you Mary to a random maid that serves him coffee, then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building, then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod. I apologize for the extreme runon sentence, but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film. Characters speak way too long about mundane things, they walk a lot, they send other people to walk, the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed, but for no dramatic effect, simply the camera man is a sophomore at Tech somewhere. The editing is mindbogglingly bad. People actions make little sense. For instance, when the professor goes to a farmers house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town, the farmer stutters and paces around. When the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside, the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later. Nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene, as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk. The entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film, but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion. I have seen better high school video productions. Finally, the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story. I get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage. However, it is so awful in technical aspects, and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad. Avoid this film at all costs.","label":0},{"index":9799,"txt":"You do not expect much from a PRC picture, and with rare exceptionsmainly from Edgar G. Ulmer and a few by Joseph H.

And the lead character here, Tara B. True, really IS some kind of superchick. A stewardess not flight attendant who is so goodlooking that even her planes autopilot has made a pass at her !, and with a hunky boyfriend in every port, this wingin, swingin gal really does put the lay in layover. What with her germaphobe surgeon beau in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and her creatively challenged rock star dude in L.A., Tara sure does keep busy. And when she is not draining these guys of all their manly energies, as the viewer learns, she is liable to be taking a karate class, milehigh clubbing, fending off flashers and rapists, attending groovy pot parties AND stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane. As I said, lighthearted fun, and surely good for a night when you are feeling somewhat braindead and just want to veg out in front of the tube. Future astrologist Joyce Jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as Tara, and the film looks handsome enough to please. Disappointingly, buxom 70s faves Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin aka Candy Samples are wasted here in very small roles, but still get to do what they do bestshow off their chesticles!

Superchick, which was first released in 1973, now comes into this category. Its cult status is largely due to ongoing interest in it by those women who regard it as an early and effective feminist film.Despite the Superwoman connotation, Superchick is not a cartoon character but a very competent young lady working as an air stewardess  a career option which in the 1970s was commonly regarded as one of the most glamorous open to any girl, and which also enables her to emulate the traditional matelot who reputedly has a wife in every port. Since she holds black belt status in karate, she is in a position to make it quite clear that she is very happy with her bachelor existence, and is in no way beholden to any of her extensive suite of male admirers. This film is a situation comedy which avoids the generally much shorter lived appeal of outright farce. Its appeal to feminists is also heightened by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate abilities to avert a hijacking and save all the other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate. To ensure that this film will appeal to men as well as to their partners, the Director has wisely ensured that is liberally sprinkled with eye candy.Superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light easy to watch comedy which they will forget soon after viewing. It is so forgettable that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if watched again in a years time; despite its age it may therefore retain its status as a cult movie for some time to come. However the dialogue and acting would make it hard to give this film a rating of more than 410.","label":0},{"index":9809,"txt":"My children watch the show everyday that its on.

Then, the next day, my film professor spent the entire class period explaining all of the movies hidden little details, like how the mural depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is some kind of commentary on the lack of identity that Spain as a nation has developed under fascist rule. Apparently, the whole movie is chock full of clever little visual tricks and references like this.Great, but you know what? It is still a bad movie. It takes more than depth and complexity to make a good filmyou still need to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention, something to interest the viewer enough to actually care about all the subtle tricks. High Heels gives us strange, offbeat characters but keeps them in mostly mundane situations recycled from other movies, and Almodovar does not seem to be using them to make any kind of point. What is the significance, for example, of the Hitchcockian surprise character revelation that occurs towards the end of the film? Why is that even in there? Just to surprise us?There is one funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast. And that is it, that is the only entertaining moment. The rest of the movie is just nonsensical filmic references and visual cues that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart Pedro Almodovar is.

It is a terrific production, and shows what good actors can do with a play that is less than perfect. Angela Lansbury is extremely funny as Madame Arcati.It was probably a mistake, then, to check out the film version of the play starring Rex Harrison. The movie does not have the energy or the laughs of a good stage production.Blithe Spirit is probably one of those plays that works better with a live cast, in an audience full of people who have come to laugh. The actors can improvise, give touches and nuances to their performance and delivery of the lines, and involve the audience on a personal level that you cannot get in a movie house, or with a DVD showing, where the audience is separated from the story by the Fourth Wall. The story Charles Condomine Rex Harrison, a successful writer, lives with his wife Ruth Constance Cummings in a house in the English countryside. Seeking information for his next book, a book dealing with the supernatural, Charles invites Madame Arcati Margaret Rutherford, reprising her role from the original 1941 London production, a local spiritual medium, over to his house to conduct a s\u00e9ance. Charles believes that spiritism is a sham, but hopes to pick up the tricks of the trade. But then Madame Arcati brings back the ghost of Elvira Kaye Hammond, Charless first wife, who died of pneumonia seven years ago. Elvira refuses to leave, and develops a spitting rivalry with Ruth over Charles complicated by the fact that only Charles can see or hear Elvira.On stage, the actors can give performances that invite laughs in this situation. But on the screen, the actors in Blithe Spirit tear through the lines as if they do not know that anyone is listening to them. They mumble lines that were designed to get laughs on the stage. The performances by Harrison, Cummings, and even Kaye Hammond are flat and lifeless. Only Margaret Rutherford seems to have retained her spark and humor as Madame Arcati.The Oscarwinning visual effects in the film are unimpressive  not just by todays standards, but by the standards of 1946! They consist mostly of Kaye Hammond walking around in fluorescent green outfits and makeup, being photographed in special lighting to make her look like a glowing ghost.The cinematographer deserves some credit for creative lighting. But compare the dull visual effects of Blithe Spirit to the truly groundbreaking effects in Disneys Song of the South  which was eligible for awards the same year. In South, humans and animated characters share the screen seamlessly for minutes at a time. Compared to South, the Oscar that Blithe Spirit received for special effects was completely undeserved.At any rate, I can only encourage you to catch the Broadway revival of this play with Angela Lansbury before it closes.

She does too much deranged fooling about when she is supposed to be surprisingly down to earth. The Madame Arcati joke is that mediums were usually portrayed as wispy females in long drapery. Arcati behaves like a retired headmistress We will really put our backs into it!. The contrast between her breezy, commonplace manner and her wacky beliefs is not really brought out.Just because all the actors are English apart from Cummings, the Americans feel they have to use the words Brit, stiff, lip and upper.

With the exception of the Stanley Steamer song, none of the other Harry WarrenRalph Blane songs are worth remembering and even that one is questionable. It was right after the release of this film that MGM let Mickey Rooney go and I do not think it was a coincidence. The film was made in 1946 and released in 1948, so Mickey was 26 playing an Andy Hardy like teenager. He was just way too old for the part of the 17 year old who was affecting radical ideas in a spirit of youthful rebellion.Rooney made four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948, this one, Killer McCoy a remake of Robert Taylors A Crowd Roars, Love Laughs at Andy Hardy and Words and Music. In all of them Rooney was playing an adult part. Even in the Andy Hardy film, Mickey played an adult Andy Hardy returned from World War II. Why he was in this Louis B. Mayer only knows. Rooneys bad casting makes Summer Holiday all the worse because in the original Ah Wilderness the emphasis is on the fathers character played here by Walter Huston. And in the Broadway show Take Me Along which won a Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, the Great One played the inebriated brotherinlaw Uncle Sid here played by Frank Morgan and that is the central character.Gloria DeHaven steps in for Judy Garland as Rooneys sweet and adorable girl friend and Marilyn Maxwell plays the show girl who gives Rooney an adult education. In the original play ONeill has her as a prostitute, but this was the Hollywood of the Code so all Marilyn does is get young Rooney soused.A lot of really talented people had a hand in this one and they do their best, but Summer Holiday fades rather quickly into a chilly autumn.","label":0},{"index":9817,"txt":"You just got to love opening sequences like the one in Seven Women for Satan \u0085 During the intro there is a naked girl running through the woods, chased by a hunting dog and a malignant looking dude on a horse, until she falls off a cliff and splits her head open on a rock. Then the camera zooms out on the face of the guy and we notice how he is simply sitting behind a desk whilst his secretary waiting for him to sign some papers. Oh I am sorry, I was lost in my thoughts\u0085 he then says! Sweet, I have stumbled upon yet another completely bonkers movie. Even if you only understand a minimum of French and have a look at the original title, you immediately know that Seven Women for Satan has not got anything to do with Satan or ritual sacrifices, but simply revolves on the flamboyant escapades of a perverted and mentally unstable count during his weekend in the countryside. This is, in fact, another sleazy variation on the classic milestone The Most Dangerous Game about a lunatics disturbing hobby of hunting people \u0096 preferably hot naked chicks  in the forest for sports. Well actually, this is more than just a variation on the 1932 classic, as writerdirectoractor Michel Lemoine had the pretension to directly link his protagonist to Leslie Banks legendary villain in The Most Dangerous Game. Count Zaroff supposedly is the original Count Zaroffs son but he exchanged his private island for the remote French countryside. He also cannot afford to be unemployed anymore, so he is an office clerk from Monday to Friday and a maniacal killer during the weekend. Zaroff is a genuine weirdo who hallucinates about dancing with deceased woman but actually runs his car over the live ones. His butler once pledged to prevent the Zaroffs from killing, but he is obviously doing a lousy job. There is not any depth in the screenplay and the buildup certainly does not pay attention to suspense or sinister atmosphere. Really, the only useful thing to do during this film is count the girls that are lured for Zaroffs deceptive trap and hope they will reach seven rapidly. Half of the film is pointless and tedious padding footage, like the overlong erotic dance act in which a statue inexplicably transforms into a muscular black guy ???, and the other half exists of psychedelic sleaze that eventually grows tiresome as well even though all the girls look ravishing. I have the impression that it was Michel Lemoines intention to imitate his pal Jean Rollin and make a deliriously kinky sexthriller. Seven Women for Satan is a French production, so inevitably it also stars Jess Franco regular Howard Vernon The Awful Dr. Orloff, Zombie Lake.

Or not.Boris Zaroff is played by writerdirector Michel Lemoine. Whereas his ancestor hunted men because they were the only prey that were truly challenging, Boris victims are usually in a position where they cannot defend themselves. The film rambles from scene to scene with a neartotal lack of clarity. The director seems to have totally disregarded pacing and left the viewer with a suffocatingly dull film. A few individual scenes are mildly interesting such as a torture rack sequence, but as a unit, the film fails to entertain.

People were arriving there hoping to fulfill their dreams. Expecting open arms and welcoming offers there were only a few who managed to succeed and find their way to stardom, majority then condemned to live starving, disillusioned and unwanted, searching for a bit of respect in dirty bars and nasty hotel rooms. Young ItalianAmerican writer Arturo Bandini arrives to LA on a similar quest  to spread his charms around to get one of those beautiful wealthy women and to write an excellent novel that would set him on a career path, having so far written a single short story published in an obscure anthology. Wishing to create a romantic masterpiece he seems to be unable to produce anything without experiencing it himself though, occasionally, he sends pieces of magazine stories to a local editor that helps him survive. He is proud to present himself as an Italian but deep in his heart he truly feels his Italian origin as a burden. The little money and the courage to conquer the world he once had are all long gone and watching his dream turning into a hangover he holds a last single nickel to spend. The coffee she brought him was cold and sour and spitting a curse on her triggers a neverending relationship of insults, unspoken excuses and a love concealed beneath. Camilla being an uneducated girl trying to receive US citizenship through a marriage also carries her heavy cross of a nonperspective racial heritage. Though she is much of a stronger and life experienced person her situation as a beautiful Mexican woman is much harder to deal with than Arturo is able to realize. Is it obvious that Arturo eventually finds his inspiration to work on the novel? Is it possible that their love finally finds its place in the sun? Is it likely that their romance takes an unlucky turn?It is very surprising to find out that the chemistry between the two main characters, performed by Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, does not work. The relationship lacks the raw and authentic feelings. Hayek though livelier a character compared to Farrells forgot to arm Camilla with the passion and strength of her once brilliant character Frida. Also it is hard to have faith in a character which being intelligent but uneducated and illiterate uses quite difficult vocabulary and complicated sentences. A tougher character of a Phil Marlowe sort would definitely suit Farrell better, though he looks stunning in a period costume, he seems very lost trying to find the fragile world of a twentyyear old dreamer balancing between a hidden love and desire to be true to himself. Feeling embarrassed watching the two on the screen is not right. Their relationship might have been wild but it is more likely what a thunder and a lightning are without a storm, far from real passion, feelings just described not felt inside.

Indeed, quite a few so called facts in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious.I suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when, in the opening credits, it was claimed that this film is based upon the book, Our Sunshine. If ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was. This was not going to be a historical epic, but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of Ned Kelly, albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version.Unfortunately, Ned Kelly is nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel real life historical drama wannabe! The story plods along at an alarming rate alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly! The feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of Costners awful Wyatt Earp all those years ago. Simply put, nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing. This would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good because the direction sure as heck was not. However, unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst Oirish accent, then you are gonna be disappointed. Between that, the game of Who has the stupidest beard?, Spot the obvious backstabber! clue, they are all ginger for some reason, and Nature in Australia.including lions, it is an experience similar to flicking through Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover. Yup, nature pops up a lot, as to fill even more time possibly an attempt to look arty, the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots, and once all the native species are shown, heres a circus to allow for a camel and a lion which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people.This is a turgid, emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to TV. There is not even one good word I can say about this film. Even the usually fantastic Rush seems embarrassed to be here. When one of the characters comments that there is only 2 bullets left for him and his pal, I myself was wishing I had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head!","label":0},{"index":9833,"txt":"This movie proves that good acting comes from good direction and this does not happen in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a fine actor but in this he is juvenile. Donald Sutherland comes across as an amateur. Why? Because the script is awful, the adaptation is awful and the actors seem bored and half hearted. The atmosphere of the movie is bad  I could only think when it would finish and I turned it off half way. The director has done a very poor job and even though I have not read the novel it is certainly a missed chance. The atmosphere this film is trying to evoke and the message and storyline never reaches the audience. In one word, it is a TERRIBLE film.","label":0},{"index":9834,"txt":"This is a movie that demonstrates that mood and music and texture are not enough to make a good film. Sure, the viewer is treated to numerous fine scenes of Los Angeles in the thirtiesI especially liked the view of the trolley approaching the tunnel, and the tram rising up the hillsidebut in a sense this fine cinematography is selfdefeating, because it creates a mood that somethings going to happenand nothing does. The script too keeps feinting toward some plot or action or traumaand time after time not delivering. Not even delivering the I assume theme of the movie, the characters essential misfit. The lead actors, both too pretty for their roles, did not convey any repression or agony, and the script did not expose us to any.Now, Donald Sutherland? That is another story.

From time to time there are hints that something interesting might happen, or that there is potentially some depth underneath one of the characters, but that is all we get  hints. There is not a single payoff or revelation in the entire movie. Not that I need a slick plot to be entertained...I love a good meandering character study as much as the next indie buff. But these characters add up to nothing. For the entire duration of the film you do not care what happens to a single one of them. As a matter of fact, you almost start hoping they die, because at least a death might be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unpredictable that you would think it in itself would be compelling, but it is not. Instead of quirky, noiresquire characters acting in hardboiled fashion, you simply recognize it immediately for what it is a bunch of talented but miscast actors, brooding and raising their eyebrows while reading bizarre dialogue without a hint of relevant context. All this for two plodding, painfully slow hours. Awful.","label":0},{"index":9836,"txt":"I will be blunt.

Her main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman, but the villain hires a guy to kill her. So this is what happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. Utterly stupid, as anyone killed in this movie has the new sheriff to thank. She had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars, but I guess because she liked him she would not do it. The killer is also after the mayor of the town for personal reasons that are also rather dumb. This movie is very boring and not really worth watching...it is not one of the better episodes of MST3000 they made.

John Ireland is Roses new hubby, secretly working for unctuous Allison Hayes yes, the 50foot woman.

She was an actress ahead of her time, bringing power and grace to even such lame flicks as the Corman films she starred in. In Gunslinger, she is the town sheriffs wife. He gets offed, so she takes over his job to pursue his killers. She is better than the material she is working with, by far. The movie is gray, stilted, and mostly boring. There is someunintentionalhumor with the tire tracks everywhere, people running behind one building to emerge suddenly in front of another I have heard of false fronts, but this is ridiculous!, and the truly stupid plot line of the newly widowed sheriff falling in love with the guy hired to kill her. Even if she had not loved her husband, it had only been something like a week or two since he would died! And she ends up shooting the guy to death in the end, anyway. No luck with men, this one.The villain of the piece is another woman, the saloon owner. She is scheming to buy up a bunch of land just in case the railroad goes through and makes her rich. Her plan of action if it does not is pretty lameshe will just steal as much from the town as she can and skedaddle. Hell, it is just her and her hired gun at the end against an entire town. Are you telling me these people are not armed? Look what happened in real towns of the Old West when bank robbers came in to rob the bank, then were cut down in a hail of bullets by the armed and dangerous town folk.Therea a lot of pointless talking and riding around, interspersed with a few lame shoot outs. The ending is as grim as usual in a Corman flick, although thank goodness it lacks the moral proselytizing at the end that was in It Conquered the World. The sheriff turns over her badge to Sam Bass and rides off into the sunset, although the movie was so gray that you never saw the sun.","label":0},{"index":9840,"txt":" When the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes over until and is determined to cleanup the town. Not everyone in town, however, is happy with what she is doing. When the sheriff orders a curfew in town, the local saloon owner also a woman hires a killer to take care of the sheriff. There is no way the saloon owner could know that the sheriff and the killer would fall in love. Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combine it with poor execution. There is a good movie here somewhere trying to get out. In more capable hands or with a larger budget, Gunslinger might have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the Old West. As it is, Gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie. There are just so many things wrong with the movie a supporting cast with no acting ability, stilted and unnatural dialogue, and sets that look like sets. But the biggest offender is the editing. I was amazed at how many times a scene would begin with the actors and horses for that matter obviously waiting for Corman to yell Action. The best is the scene of two riders on horseback just standing beside a building. All of a sudden, they take off and come racing around the corner like they had been riding hard for several miles. Or, take the example of people who can seemingly transport themselves across town. We see a man enter a building and a second later emerge across town to mount his horse. It is not as if Corman did not have a few decent actors to work with. While none were great stars, Beverly Garland, John Ireland, and Allison Hayes were all capable of turning in a good performance. But, in Gunslinger, they are not given much to work with. I have now seen both the MST3K and nonMST3K versions of the movie. I would strongly recommend going the MST3K route.","label":0},{"index":9841,"txt":"I will admit that I do not expect much from a Roger Corman film. Generally, I expect a lot of walking and bad scripts. Yet in this case, I am pleasantly surprised.The Gunslinger is a story of a woman played by the spunky Beverly Garland who takes over as sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered. Ms. Garland is a pretty good shot herself, killing one of the murderers the next day at her husbands funeral. Her first task is to shut down the local bar that is violating the town curfew. The bars owner is trying to buy land in anticipation of being bought out by the hopedfor railroad. However, Ms. Garland is a thorn in her plans, and the bar matron hires a man to kill Ms. Garland.Because of Ms. Garlands plays her role honestly and realistically, there is absolutely no temptation to go to Suzanne Somers She is the Sheriff jokes. With the exception of a couple of faux pas the apartment door that opens OUT from the inside, jeep tracks, and the two horsemen waiting on screen for their cue to ride around a corner, the movie becomes quite passable as movie fare.

Well, I was entertained all right. I had almost as many laughs as watching Mel Brooks Blazing Saddles.See the spectacle of mobile tire tracks on the prairie of the old west. You can kill time by counting them if there happens to be an otherwise boring scene going on. And the horses seem to have gears in them too, considered the fastforward chases. See also the swinging bar room queens of the traditional wild west saloon doing a number that reminds of a certain fashionable dance from 1920s, here decades before the style was invented. Hope the saloon around them will not crumple.In the middle of all this mayhem the main actors do a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are all truly fine. A special praise for them for doing the best they could with the material that seems mostly having been lifted from Johnny Guitar, but does not quite impress the same way. But there is really nothing wrong with a laughable western like this. Just like a really bad old horror movie, it might fail one way but succeeds to give joy anyway.

Still, I thought Three Days of the Condor must be good because of the number of praising comments it has received.Although the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and Max von Sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer, I found the whole affair tremendously disappointing. The film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere, but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which does not seem to make any sense.The film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings I have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air.

Who killed them and why? That is what Redford tries to find out while trying to not be the 8th victim at the same time. Along the way, he gets Faye Dunaways character involved involved, originally because he needs a place to hide, and then she eventually helps him out after a little loveydovey time. This is one of a handful of innocent guy on the run stories but this one does not have a lot of suspense. The flat performances do not help and the finish does not seal the deal for the audience enough either. Despite having a good director in Sydney Pollack and a group of classic performers, the story and the performances are not what they should be and therefore the movie is not what it should be.","label":0},{"index":9846,"txt":"I cannot get past the message of this movie. It is laid out much too clearly to ignore, and it is obscene because it has lost its sense of what it is about. I have not read the novel, but Pollacks film opens with a scene at a CIAfront organization in New York, which is broken into by two professional assassins, headed by Max von Sydow, who proceed to brutally slaughter the half dozen quirky staff members we have come to know and understand. The staff include an elderly female receptionist, a fussy elderly professorial guy who is toupee falls off when he is machinegunned is that a joke?, and, last, the beautiful Tina Chen who looks up from the copier, realizes she is about to be murdered, and says, pitifully brave, I will not scream. Von Sydow replies sympathetically, I know. These murders are completely unexpected, savage, unmotivated by anything that we are aware of, and graphic. It is a brutal scene. There is absolutely no way in which von Sydow and his henchman can be redeemed. And yet that is exactly what Pollack tries to do towards the end.After having killed these innocent good guys, von Sydow switches sides because the other side is willing to pay him and assassinates the evil mastermind behind a complicated intramural CIA plot. The script then turns him into a perfectly reasonable, sensitive human being. It is better to live in Europe. Things are not so rushed. Or whatever. I swear I am not making this up. Pollack wants us to believe that it is better to be an honest mass murderer than a crooked bureaucrat. That is the message. You should write it down in case you forget. Just exactly what kind of psychiatric shambles do you have to be in order to turn ordinary values, not to mention common sense, upsidedown like that? I understand that there are thoughtful adults who dislike the government of the United States, even hate it, and who see conspiracies just about everywhere, providing a kneejerk explanation for otherwise unexplainable events. I know that people who think this way exist because I number some of them among my closer friends. Nevertheless, at some point this dislike, this hatred, if it increases in intensity, must pass beyond politics or ethics and into the realm of the psychiatric. I do not for a moment believe that a man who murders people for money is better than a sinister government official. I do not care how suave and cultured the murderer is or whether he knows how to reach the Louvre on the Metro. Whoever is purveying that message needs either medication or meditation.I would like to be able to argue that the production is as thoroughly rotten as its message, but I cannot. It is quite well done. In some ways that is worse, because it makes the film less dismissable. Even New York City looks photogenic on the screen. And it is been a long time since I have thought of New York as photogenic. Robert Redford does an admirable job of projecting his characters initial shock and confusion, but then turns into a telecommunicational semigenius. And, man, he looks just fine! His wardrobe is just right. Even his rimless glasses are becoming. And his peacoat. It is not everyone who can make a navy pea jacket look glamorous. He seems extremely handsome too, the swine. I want to look like that. I want to wear a denim shirt and a tie with such panache. Faye Dunaway is alright in her role but it is not too believable a role. Would anybody eagerly sleep with a guy who has just kidnapped her and is holding her at gunpoint? Even if he did look like Redford? Would anyone be emotionally wounded if, when this ambivalent relationship is about to end, Redford asked her not to tell anybody about what happened? Cliff Robertson is surprisingly good. He does one or two extremely good doubletakes. The mailman is superb. The fight between him and Redford in a crowded apartment is exquisitely choreographed and, for once, we really do not know for sure how it will turn out, because Redford a book reader after all seems mismatched against the brute cunning of this hired assassin. This is one of John Housemanns final roles. A shame. He is a magnet on screen. And what an end to his life a friend finds him lost, wandering the streets of New York, in a neighborhood he would been familiar with for most of his life. Yes, the movie is very well executed, but I cannot ignore that vicious, paranoid message. I have the same problem with Leni Riefenstahls Triumph of the Will.

The role was originally to have been filled by June Allyson and Judy is definitely unable to fill the shoes of Margaret Sullavans old part. Van Johnson also turns in a rather bland performance as a second rate Jimmy Stewart type. The leads never achieve the chemistry of StewartSullavan or even that of HanksRyan.This is a film that knows some of the notes, but not the music. It does not really seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add another possible love interest for Van Johnsons character to complicate things unnecessarily. The remakes substitution for the originals infidelity subplot is a hackneyed plot device involving a priceless violin. It is almost embarrassing to watch and feels as if it had perhaps been lifted from an episode of Threes Company by someone with a DeLorean and a flux capacitor. It is really just an excuse for a Keaton pratfall. Even the big resolution scene between the romantic leads is mishandled. After seeing both films, you will understand why they called it the Lubitsch Touch and NOT the Robert Z. Leonard Touch.Avoid this and rewatch either the original film or one of Judy Garlands earlier films unless you are an iconoclast who enjoys seeing a once great star falling down to earth.","label":0},{"index":9858,"txt":"This little show is obviously some stupid little prequelspin off of the original series.Compared to the live action series this show is utter crap.

So then Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvery to become her slave.

What a sad state of our cinema when unprofessional junk like this is considered Oscar worthy.I divide material into three levels. The first is the stage theatre. Here the viewer is stagnant and the power rests in the presentation of the actor and, most importantly, in the power of the writer. A good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows the ways of words better. The best playwrights know how to create imagery that the barren stage cannot show.The second level is film. In this medium, a weaker writer can be used, but the viewer is not sitting in one spot the entire time. With film, the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning in addition to strong writing. Furthermore, film can manipulate everday elements like sound and color in ways that are almost surreal.The final level is literature. In this context, everything is imagined by the author, translated onto paper, and then reimagined by the reader. Far more detail can go into a novel than is conceivable for a film studio.This is why adaptations can go up, but never down. Novelizations are never better than the base film see the dimeperdozen ones at your local book store, whereas the film cannot convey the same power as the original book Catch22 and LotR. Movies can rarely be made into plays and plays can always be made into movies.As for The Last Picture Show, it fails. It is a film that should stick to the stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right. The characters talk the same and act the same, it is pure futility. Add to that an obnoxious soundtrack and you have an entirely unwatchable film.I saw this in my high school drama class with about 20 other wannabe thespians. The instructor raved about how sad the movie was. What is sad is how such stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious. Had this been in color the scenes of impotence, the pool party, and the old hooker would be considered great comedy. Look what Lucas did with American Graffiti a few years later.The American secondary education system needs to start teaching ABOUT film rather than trying to teach WITH film.

Instead, I shall take a look at the positive aspects of this overrated celluloid pygmy of a film.1. Peter Bogdanovich managed to make a movie that can be endured in its entirety. This fact alone places the movie high up above and all the way up to the top of his lame filmography.2. Bogdanovich had shown how amazingly generous some lucky boyfriends can be, by sharing Cybill Shepherds his thengal fabulous body and breasts with his male audience  and not just on one but on two occasions. Brava! The unquestionable highlights of this cinematic festa del siesta.3. TLPS has barely a scene without stereotypical country music doodling in the background. Peter tried to make the obvious point that the movie is set in Americas Deep South as if it were not bleedin obvious so he hammered that point on and on and on... How is this an advantage, you might ask? Well, when the movie finally ends and the monotonous country music finally ceases massaging your tired eardrums, you start experiencing a strange exhilaration The movies finally over! It is pure joy.4. The movie gives all women who look like Cloris Leachman hope. Hope that they, too, may one day snatch a much younger and maybe even goodlooking boyfriend.5. Cloris Leachmans biography which I realize is not technically a part of TLPS gives hope to all women that look like that, that they too may one day win a Miss Chicago beauty pageant.

Life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50s is pretty dull  which means that a movie about life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50s will be pretty dull too! What is it that so many people see in this? Once the last picture show in Anarene closes there really will not be anything to do in town. Duane Jeff Bridges makes that point at the end of the movie. But even before it closes there is not much to do, so basically everything revolves around sex. High school students make plans for how to lose their virginity  sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town. You see, there is not much for them to do either  except to have sex sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers or to whine about the local high school football team. Three times something happened that I thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie. Sam Ben Johnson dies unexpectedly, but nothing really happens because of that, Sonny Timothy Bottoms and Jacy Cybill Shepherd elope, but nothing really happens because of that, Joe Bob Barc Doyle kidnaps a little girl, but nothing really happens because of that. The only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of Billy Sam Bottoms which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town, as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfast.Peter Bogdanovic filmed this in black and white, which is intended I suppose to point out how grey this town is, but the only thing I found interesting was the early look at actors like Bottoms, Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid. As an aside it was terrifying to see how much Quaid  in 1971  actually looks like his character of Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation movies. Classic?

Its main positive, as far as I am concerned, is the stunning photography. But for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty and a kind of hidden beauty, at that. The characters were very hard to relate to or to care about. Basically you had this very slow pace and this naturalistic style of acting, but it was all there to prop up a very formulaic and predictable story, complete with all the trappings one would expect from any small town melodrama  everything from the boy cheating with his teachers wife to the handicapped kid who everyone picks on. It was like American Graffiti without the joy of life.Some might say this film is more realistic  nowadays a lot of people seem to think that realism is the only virtue a film can possess. But for me the film was simply oppressive, and I want to see it again about as badly as I would like to spend a few hours in that miserable town the characters live in.Maybe this film really just belongs to its time  perhaps if I would seen it in 1971 I would have been impressed by its novelty, just by seeing something different on the screen. But that would basically assume that I had never seen anything like, say, Godards Breathless. Maybe the overt references to classic films would have appealed to the movie geek in me and helped me to overlook some of the films weaknesses. But in the postTarantino world that hardly seems unique or special either.It is interesting though how he uses the films in the film to give his own film more depth. We see 3 films as I recall in the picture show. First we see Vincente Minnellis Father of the Bride  Liz Taylors exquisite looks provide a contrast to Sonnys girlfriend and Minnellis studied uppermiddle class milieu contrasts to the characters real life surroundings in a similar way. Later, clips from Howard Hawks Red River emphasize the theme of a broken friendship between a mentor and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. It really just reminds me that Bogdanovich is kissing his own mentors butt, much as he did if I remember correctly by selecting a Hawks film as part of his own onscreen reverie with Boris Karloff in Targets. I guess in 1971 this kind of thing was new but looking at it today it just seems selfindulgent, like so much of the rest of this film.Ultimately, I would rather see another film by Hawks, Ford or Minnelli than to have Bogdanovichs film remind us of why they were so striking in such a lessthansubtle way. Maybe he intends to remind us of the giants whose time had passed  all he really does is remind us how small he and most of his contemporaries are in relation.","label":0},{"index":9870,"txt":"This is the kind of movie which shows the paucity of French cinema when it comes to making thrillers.The directors desire to sound American is so glaring that you will not be fooled a minute,unless you have not seen a serial killer movie since Peeping Tom.Two male cops or one and a half,more like,as you will see,horrible murders,a plot more complicated than complex.Charles Berling is not lucky with the genresee the astoundlingly dumb linconnu de Strasbourg a couple of years ago.The scenes with his pregnant wife which are supposed to be a counterpart for the otherwise noir atmosphere of the rest of the plotare among the worst ever filmed.Add a steamy love scene between them and a gory autopsy to get a PG 12 and thus to attract the huge adolescent audience.A violent and absurd conclusion,followed by a silent epilogue who could make a nice commercial for the c\u00f4te dazur,it is really the silence of the lame.","label":0},{"index":9871,"txt":"I totally agree with the review by a reviewer of Variety that the film is never quite as funny, lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise would seem to warrant.

Many nonSouth Africans will have difficulty in following the spoken English in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process. I watched the film at the Cape Town World Cinema festival last year. Comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past. Unfortunately Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African New Wave, but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our 110 year old film history.

Another thing I appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leathermen or drag queens and I appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images. I felt it was very unfortunate that gay culture took on certain standard forms in the 80s out of Castro and Christopher Streets and these defined the movement and left out huge numbers of gay men that were more subdued in their lifestyles.

Which is why we have never heard of them, conveniently enough.Christian Slater, perhaps pining for the days of Heathers and Pump up the Volume, plays Edward Carnby, a paranormal researcher to whom Something Bad happened when he was 10 years old. He is hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization. Carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713, which has been trying to figure out what happened to that longago civilization. But Carnby believed he was not going to be able to find the answers he sought, so he left the group.But see, these beasties are out, and they get their prey in varying ways, such as gutting them, splitting them down the middle, implanting neurological control devices in them, or just turning them into killing zombies. Yes, it is another zombie movie.That is about as distilled I can make the plot. It is pretty convoluted and incomprehensible. In similar movies, one might see the intrepid researcheradventurer figure things out a step at a time, and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher, it is a lot of fun. But when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context... not so much fun.The acting is dreadful, save for Slater, who although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie showed he was capable of carrying the acting load. He had to; get this  Tara Reid is cast as a museum curator! Honest to goodness, I thought I would seen the casting of a lifetime when Denise Richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reid here matches Richards, crappy emoting for crappy emoting. Hightlights include Reid pronouncing Newfoundland as New Fownd Land, Reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed, throaty monotone kinda like she would been on an allnight bender for the past week before filming, Reid  a museum curator, mind you  spending a lot of the movie in a midriffbearing top and hiphugger jeans. Oh yeah, she was as believable as Jessica Simpson giving stock quotes. Oh, why must the pretty ones be so dumb? Note I do not think Tara Reids all that good looking. She looks like she is in perpetual need of food. Almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable, except perhaps for Steven Dorff, who played Burke, one of the leaders of 713. Dorffs character was not terribly well developed, but nothing in the movie was, from the sets to the characters to Tara Reid. But I digress.Anyway, the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace, but director Uwe Boll tosses in a pounding, minddeadening soundtrack; it is so loud you cannot hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes! That cannot be right. Given the acting level, however, perhaps thanks are in order to Mr. Boll.Oh, and a fun note. The opening moments of the movie include narration... of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time. Remember the first Star Wars? You heard that nowfamiliar Star Wars theme while the prologue crawled. There was surely no need for narration; why do I need some doofus to read what is on the screen for me? Were the producers simply looking out for blind people? Maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud  they were also looking out for hardofhearing people. Also, the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl  then lost it. Bizarre.Alone in the Dark is a loud, dopey mishmash of dreadful acting, an incoherent script, and hamhanded directing. Hardly a note rings true. There is so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise. Even in the dark, the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison.Ironically, since there were only three other people in the theater, I watched this Alone in the Dark. I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it that way? I cannot quite give this the lowest rating, because I had low hopes for it to begin with  and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it. It is atrocious, although Slater redeems himself a tiny bit.","label":0},{"index":9890,"txt":"In 1967, mine workers find the remnants of an ancient vanished civilization named Abkani that believe there are the worlds of light and darkness. When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something evil slipped through before the gate was closed. Twentytwo years ago, the Government Paranormal Research Agency Bureau 713 was directed by Professor Lionel Hudgens Matthew Walker, who performed experiments with orphan children. On the present days, one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby Christian Slater, who has just gotten an Abkani artifact in South America, and is chased by a man with abilities. When an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night, he discloses that demons are coming back to Earth. With the support of the anthropologist Aline Cedrac Tara Reid and the leader of the Bureau 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke Stephen Dorff, and his squad, they battle against the evil creatures.In spite of having a charismatic good cast, leaded by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, Alone in the Dark never works and is a complete mess, without development of characters or plot. The reason may be explained by the brilliant interview of director Uwe Boll in the Extras of the DVD, where he says that videogames are the bestsellers of the younger generations that are not driven by books anymore. Further, his target audience would be people aged between twelve and twentyfive years old. Sorry, but I find both assertions disrespectful with the younger generations. I have a daughter and a son, and I know many of their friends and they are not that type of stupid stereotype the director says. Further, IMDb provides excellent statistics to show that Mr. Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong.

It is not that I am a tough critic, it is just that this movie is THAT bad. Everything from the story, to the directing, to the editing is awful. The story is not even halfway decent to begin with you cannot expect much since it is based on a video game, something I was not aware of going into the movie but the directing and editing made it even worse. The movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones; some, like a quick sex scene in the middle, do not even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the characters do not show any feelings toward each other. You could go into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you would still be disappointed.

I meant to go see how horrible it was but it was out of theaters in three weeks. The only other movie to manage that is Gigli. When the movie came out on DVD, I bought it to see how awful it was. I could not think of the sheer horrible attention that this film was getting was possible. After seeing it, I can understand. First off, let me say that this film is not without some cool shots. There is a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun, which I thought was neat. And the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at; but it gets old after the first time you see it. Let me start with the worst thing in this movie Tara Reid. If bad acting was a sin, then Hell would have chucked Tara Reid right out since she is so unbelievably awful in this movie it is unthinkable. And of all the roles, she plays a curator. Now if she played a dumb, empty headed sex toy then maybe I might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll did not realize that, although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie, people would see it. He just did not realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad. And is that a Mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping? I could not tell. Which brings me to my next complaint Uwe Boll shows off some of the worst directing skills you will ever see in a movie. I mean, I would give House of the Dead an F and I only do that for very few movies but HotD would score at least a B compared to this screwed up piece of junk. The movie starts off with a very, very long narration that causes immediate confusion and read by a horrible narrator and from there, the cuts are really, really dumb. There is this one point where Slater and Reid are looking around a building that is been destroyed and the screen blackens out. When it comes back, Slater and Reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly, an entire army has joined them. Huh? And someone did NOT bother checking the mistakes in this movie. At one point, a team breaks through glass, but the glass breaks before they touch it. Tara Reids earrings switch colors in the middle of one scene and after Slater walks away from a dead comrade, you can see her begin to get up. As for the story... I was really lost. Something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone opens the path or something and all the evil monsters pop out. It is just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this film that get, quite simply, BORING. I bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was. I did not laugh, but I still think it is stupid. Very, very, very stupid.","label":0},{"index":9893,"txt":"We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. He is done the unthinkable. He may be the only director to have two movies in the bottom 100 on IMDb! He is like some kind of cinematic cockroach. No matter how little talent he has, and no matter how bad these movies are, he manages to keep making them. I know, he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to keep making movies despite absolute, complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe.It would not be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games. Even the latest one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of game play. There was a good movie to be made out of Edward Carnbys adventures, but this is not it. Now Uwe Boll has gotten his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter the Reckoning. What is next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through gametomovie adaptations if he is not stopped. Someone needs to take away his line of credit, or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise, no one is interested in that title any more.Think about it, is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title anymore? No way. A new House of the Dead game comes out for XBox and nobodys gonna care. The title is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll. So if any of you out there work for a game publisher, or know a game publisher, or have access to a game publisher... please warn them. This movie itself is not even worth reviewing. I cannot separate what I did not like about this pile of dung from the rest of it. Literally, everything about it sucks. The writing, the acting, the music, the CG effects, the editing.

Now, mind you  I am weary of computergamegenerated movies. I do not remember a single success story in this new Hollywood genre, although some are entertaining enough to be watchable. And yet, I am such a big fan of the game that I could not resist. My rationale was that if the movie had a plot that so much as resembled the games, it would be OK. Man, those were 90 minutes which seemed like 300 of my life that I will never get back. If I had that chance, I would have gladly spent them rearranging my sock drawer instead. This is not even in the so bad it is funny category. You would think even Christian Slater had a bit more sense than joining this stink bomb. Now, Tara Reid... I am not complaining about her presence. However, if the purpose of putting this chick in a starring role is to have a sex scene,  which I totally understand and support hey, I am a guy!  I have seen more of her body on press conferences.There is no plot to speak of. Will not waste your time pitching it to you.

Wait for the porno version.","label":0},{"index":9895,"txt":"There should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like Resident Evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible. RE was a survival horror game, and a damn effective one at that, yet Paul WS Anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along. Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as Resident Evil, so of course, there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie. Instead, Alone in the Dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies.The plot, despite the fact that it obviously is not supposed to matter, is the largest of many problems with the movie. The movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important, as after a minute passes, the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them. Then there is something about an orphanage, some artefacts, an ancient tribe, some bureaucracy and some demons, all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really cannot follow with what is going on. Characters move in and out of the plot like candy, some having huge buildups for meaningless deaths. Basically, what I can understand is that some demons got released, and Edward Carnby Slater has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him. He finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an exgirlfriend anthropologist Reid, who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason. Then, out of nowhere, all hell breaks loose, and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander Dorff, who apparently has a mutual hatred for Carnby.It is all ridiculous, and the reason I do not really understand it is not just because it is complicated and jumbled, but it leaves no room for anyone to really care. Instead, I highly recommend that, if you must see this film, bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion.The action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little, right? Too bad, this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made, with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens. Considering that this is based on a horror game, not an action game, it is especially annoying.The first action scene involving a man chasing Cranby from a taxi is among the worst I have ever had to witness, and the rest is not all that great either. The demons look somewhat cool, though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect. Scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict. It is all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night.The acting is what I like to call taking actors and making them do nothing. Slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie, though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on. The same is true of Dorff, who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent something that has happened to him a lot. Reid is pretty much exactly what she should be, background sex appeal, as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning.In all, this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies. If they keep ruining the spirit like this, it is only a matter of time before Samus Aran is killing MiddleEasterns with an AK47 and Tommy Vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens. Unlike Resident Evil, however, this one does not deserve a second chance, as I do not think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is. It is bland, uninteresting and unexciting. This is the movie equivalent of diarrhea; it is all thrown together, nothing really fits and, in the end, you are just glad it is over.TOTAL 4","label":0},{"index":9896,"txt":"Alone in the Dark is Uwe Bolls kick in the nuts to Hollywood after House of the Deads punch in the face.If anything it proves just how much of a master manipulator Boll is. After forcing Artisan out of business over the flop that was House of the Dead, one can only assume the normally credible Lions Gate Films only released AITD under contractual obligation after acquiring Artisans assets. Because AITD is an even bigger example of complete lack of coherent filmmaking ability, plot exposition and just plain stealing poorly from other movies because it was supposed to look cool instead of because it fitted within the movies framework.But then that is the point, is not it. Boll is not trying to make a coherent film because he is not trying to direct Alone in the Dark. He is just trying to manipulate Hollywood.Alone in the Dark, like House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are announced or in preproduction.These are not movies to be directed, but investment portfolios. Every single one of them rushed into production under the pretence that the tax law Boll and his investors are exploiting may be closed within the next 2 to 3 years. The more bomb projects he can release within that timeframe, the more money he and his investors can gain. Why bother making a good movie when a bad movies making you a mint anyway?

Over the course of years the Columbo series has tried out some new things and diverted away from the usual successful formula but this movie really overdoes it. This movie is basically very different from any other Columbo movie but the differences are not for the good of the movie.Main thing that of course makes this movie different from any other Columbo movie is the fact that there is no murder being committed. The entire premise of this movie is totally different and it places the Columbo character in a totally different environment and situation. Also the overall is just totally different and more modernized.Director Alan J. Levi did some other Columbo movies in the past, which all very much sticked to the usual formula. It also makes it an odd choice that he got picked to direct this movie.The Columbo character himself also feels quite different, perhaps because of the reason that he gets placed in a totally different environment and situation, when he helps out his nephew after his bride disappeared right after the wedding. The absence of some good relieving and trademark Columbo humor also does not exactly make this a good or enjoyable watch.In all honesty, the movie does not begin too bad but the movie starts to become more and more ridicules with its story as it progresses. It is such a stupid written kidnapthriller with a story that starts to become more and more unlikely. It also makes the movie more and more unwatchable.

But alas I felt alone in the dark I was gonna try to avoid the pun but I could not resist as I looked around hoping to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Alas my friends and I had to provide comedy throughout the film.So... about the film itself. Lets talk about the action and effects since that should be the only positive part of the film. The film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the Xenos in Aliens they even call them Xenos, and the creatures in Pitch Black. The can turn invisible at random and I assure you it is random and get hurt by light. Also present are small centipede creatures used to control humans that transform them into something resembling a zombie. All of these are shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. The action scenes are chaotic and are impossible to follow. People shooting randomly on a blue screen stage or an empty set at monsters who were inserted in post. Light quickly flashes on a dark screen making your pupils burn from overwork while bad rock music blares in the background.And those were the high points. The story revolving around a paranormal investigator Slater whose idea of looking tough is wearing a black wife beater Tshirt with a trenchcoat and not shaving for 2 days. An archaeologist Reid who is rather inept. And a government agentDorff whose lines involve barking order. All three should be ashamed at their performances not that they have really ever done a good a job before and the casting director should be ashamed. Reid and Slater are supposed to be lovers in the film I guess. The film contains the single most awkward love scene I have ever seen on film between the two.Then comes the plot. Quiet frankly the parts that make sense are not interesting at all. The rest is illogical at best. The plot holes could contain the collective egos of all three stars. The film begins with text and a voice explaining the backstory. This opening lasts for over a minute and already the viewer knows they are in for something terrible. This opening narration is later repeated adnausem in the awkward dialog in a very clumsy and heavy handed fashion through the rest of the film. And the ending did not make one ounce of sense. Not only did it not make sense in the world of the film, it simply did not make sense.Finally the direction of one Uwe Boll. Disgrace, thats all that can be said. His use of shaking the camera to simulate suspense. His lack of direction with the actors. Just watch Reid in scenes in which she is not center focus of the shot. The complete waste of special effects money for bullet time effects. And finally choosing to use voice over to explain something that should be painfully obvious to the viewers.I payed a 1.50 to see this show at a second run theater.

Supernatural enemies with quality FX. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I generally enjoy. 5. Tara Reid is hot.So this movie had potential, at least in the cheesehorror section of the video store, but boy did it suck ass. The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone finds them as entertaining as I do...I mean, let us face it, both are melodramatic. But now on to some of the many faults.Tara Reid. Even though the movie as a whole is worse, Reids performance is truly awful. We are not just talking bad, I am talking about nominating Tara Reid for worst performance of the year. I do not know if she is capable of acting, but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league...completely. Watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist was not much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn. I mean this is not just bad, it is laughably bad. Oh, and for those of you curious, she does not get naked, only down to a bra in a silly, totally unnecessary love scene.Even with Reids performance, perhaps the movie could have worked, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems written by a 10 year old. I had not realized this was a video game adaptation until AFTER watching the DVD, otherwise I would have appreciated the stupidity in realtime. The storyline jumps back and forth from Slaters childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened, he has amnesia, of course. In his adult life Slater was recruited by some Unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, I guess, you never really know unless it was in one of those voiceovers I zoned out during. The movie starts with Slater hunting artifacts, obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a Chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities. I may have the exact quote wrong, but you get the idea.There is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth no reason given, experiments on children, super demonalienhuman hybrids, photonic bullets the demon things cannot stand sunlight and, of course, Slater and Dorf to try to save everyone.Jesus, I cannot even being to wade through the clich\u00e9d elements. The script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide SOME depth. I mean, why is this evil scientist so damn evil? Oh right, humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race. I guess he is infected? How did that happen? Oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself. How the hell did that happen? Why and where did he get the super slugs oh yes, they use the old scifi stand by of parasitic aliensdemons which fuse with the spine of their hostOf course, Slater is, like Blade, half superslug powered, but his slug did not fully fuse due to an electrical shock, thank god. Oh, and the people with these fused spines, have no idea they are halfaliendemon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies. Yeah we get zombies.So lots of crap that could be entertaining, but none of it is.Also, the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place...at least nothing a little dynamite cannot handle.Not the very worst thing you will see, but a truly bad movie.","label":0},{"index":9902,"txt":"Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slaterusually great as a dollar store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as...well it is STEPHEN DORFF FOR Christ SAKE!!!!

Some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost American Indian tribe. The Indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the second world, which was evil in nature. The bad stuff wiped them out, but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key. Later, some scientistgovernment researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal, and specifically this tribe, decided to experiment on some kids, to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world. Believe it or noteverything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the filmit is just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voiceover also reading it to us. Then, there was something about the kids being in an orphanage, but the government takes them back out, and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics, and there are super humans roaming around, and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on.In fact, the exposition never really stops. It is like a neverending backstory from hell. There are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films, maybe 25. But not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film. In addition to the mystical lost Indian tribe and the superhumans, we also get monsters that resemble a cross between Alien and a werewolf, worms that invade your body and turn into snakelike aliens, tunneling worms underground, zombies, Starship Trooperlike wars, evil scientists, underground lairs, gold mines, spooky warehouses, impalements, big mostly unused museums, government conspiracies, golden trunks pulled out of the sea, nuns, explosions, complex backstabbing plots, a very ambiguous romance, car chases, home invasions, kitchen sinks . . . wait, I cannot remember if that last one was in the film. Even more amazingly amusingly?, in Fangoria 240, producer Shawn Williamson was quoted as saying, We are spending much more time on story, being very meticulous about that. Tara Reid called Alone in the Dark a smarter film.Let me not mislead anyone. A lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film, but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else. I usually had no idea what any settings relation was to any other setting, why we were there, or what anyone was doing at least when each scene began. It is just a random mishmash of settings and clich\u00e9s, as if director Uwe Boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers. Then when he was done, he and editor Richard Schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice, then reassembled it by throwing the I Ching. Sometimes the film plays like an extended directors reel which is a combination of short, varied, unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work, but perhaps that is being too generous. I am not sure Boll would get work if this were his reel. Just as I tend to at least like most films, I tend to like most actors and most performances. It is very rare that I say that a performance was bad. Well, Tara Reid was bad hereand I am someone who usually likes Reid. I do not know what happened. For a large percentage of the film, they just move her around the set like a prop. They might as well have just bought a blowup doll. That would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings. Maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that is usually reserved for entertaining motherinlaws.And speaking of that dialogue, a lot of Alone in the Dark plays like a Godzilla film without Godzilla. By that, I mean that it is a lot of pseudoscientific gobbledygook. At least in Godzilla films, there is a campiness to it, because they know how ridiculous it is, and there is a big payoff in that we get to see Godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something.Just what Stephen Dorff and Christian Slater are doing here, besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents, is difficult to say. I cannot say that I thought anyone in the film had a decent performance, although maybe Slater at least saw the cigar. I think that is unprecedented for me.Still, I did not give this film a 1. There was some competent cinematography, even if Boll and Schwadel made mincemeat out of it, and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good. Heck, even the novelette prologue was not so bad. I actually thought the film had promise at that point. But this may just be the worst film I have ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more.","label":0},{"index":9906,"txt":"The definition of an abomination as defined by Websters Dictioary is a cause of abhorrence or disgust. If someone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than this for Alone in the Dark, please let me know because this is the best I can come up with. However, I do no feel that in anyway this word describes how truly awful this film is.I went to see this film with two of my roommates. One has very similar tastes to me, the other is an actionadventure flick guru. This latter guy usually does not care about the size of the plot holes, as long as the movie contains lots of explosions he will walk away satisfied.That being said we entered the theater for the Friday viewing of Alone in the Dark. Little to my surprise we were the only people in the theater. When it started I knew why immediately.It begins with the worst opening scene of any movie, and unfortunately I have to admit it only gets worse from there. The opening scene is a 5 minute scroll text that is narrated. Yet, I understand why it was narrated. The director must have understood that only illiterate people would even ascertain the thought of PAYING to see this movie. Yet, not only is this first scene the longest scroll text in the history of cinema, but it also makes no sense. It seems as if in the same sequence we are hearing about to completely separate movies. One is about an ancient civilization and its tampering with a portal, the other is about a crazy scientist and his experiments on orphans. If you are reading this and are confused, you are not alone.Then the awful storyline, acting, effects, and camera work begin. Tara Reid is horrendous as an actress. She does nothing to even for one second make you think that she is a museum curator. Slater is just bad, not convincing, and has no chemistry with Reid.The plot is probably the worst thing ever created by man. The entire time myself and the roommate with similar tastes are asking questions like What is this? And what is going on? Other than this scrolling garbage we have a few narrated sequences by Slater himself. Are they good? NO. Do they explain anything? NO. Do we at any point as an audience have the slightest inkling as to why we should care what happens? Once again, NO.Then we have a random sex scene. We are told that Slater and Reid are together, yet at no time do they act as though they even care about on another. But then BAM...sex scene. Once again I do not know.A good, oh i do not know, 30 seconds after that woeful scene ends we have a gunfight with 20 or so military and a similar number of alien things. This is set to a heavymetal track and causes more brain hemorrhaging than one ever thought possible.And if that was not enough...There exists no main villain. There is the scientist and there are the alien things. At one point the scientist controls the alien things and stands on a hill commanding them to attack the military outpost. Why? How did he become the supreme commander of these things? Why do they listen to him? Once again I have no idea.The movie ends with Slater and Reid walking in an evacuated city. Why was the city evacuated? Did the alien things break through? Did the military tell them? Who knows...and by this point who cares? I did not and you will not.But to top it off, Slater and Reid are attacked by an alien thing. Even though it was stated that alien things will be killed by exposure to sunlight. And thats right, you guessed it, it the middle of the ing day and it is bright as can be. Maybe the alien thing bought a pair of sunglasses, I do not know and I do not care.Now after the movie ended I ran outside the theater, all 6 foot 6 inches of me, waving my arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to go see this movie. Even my gungho actionadventure roommate who would consider a movie that just cut and pasted 2 hours of explosion into 1 film to be the greatest thing ever created admitted that plot holes were very evident in this film.To sum up this CRAPFEST i give it a 0.010 and would give it lower if I could.Unequivocally, the worst movie ever made. I would not wish this movie on my worst enemy.","label":0},{"index":9907,"txt":"The minute the forward started, I knew we were in for trouble! The premise is laughable at best.

Lines were delivered as if from a robot. And I am sorry, I like Reid but she was VERY unbelievable as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff picked a lousy film to try and stage their comebacks.

If you do not want to feel slighted you will sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they have all seen better days, but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you will lose pity for them just like you have already done for the film. I cannot go on enough about this horrible movie, its almost something that Ed Wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece.To start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you have never seenheard, this thing has got to be five minutes long. On top of that it is narrated, as to suggest that you the viewer cannot read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets underway, it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, who I typically enjoy and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does. Then comes the ultimate insult, Tara Reid playing an intelligent role, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies, in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the American pie type.

The monsters were the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected designs for the space creatures in Alien. The creators of the movie obviously did not want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters, so they hired forth rate actors who apparently did not get to memorize their lines, or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began. Some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening, if anything is. If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing, and you do not pass out, you will laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film. The implausibility of several scenes will just stun you, and Stephen Dorffs regular spewing of the Queen Mary of curse words conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this.

Hopefully Slaters career can rebound from this disaster.Hands down the worst film I have ever seen.","label":0},{"index":9914,"txt":"True, there are many movies much worse then this movie. This movie was no Manos The Hands of Fate, or Troll 2 yes, I have seen them both.. twice but at the same time this movie is No Alien, Predator or even Alien Vs. Predator Yes, even that movie surpassed this. Movies like this make Battlefield Earth look like a Star Wars it is so bad. Razzie awards lookout, your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters. This film I am talking about is of course Alone in the Dark. I will try to take you though a step by step process on why this film was so bad.Acting I will first start off with what perhaps was the best component of this film next to the ending credits, which played Wish I had An Angel, the acting. Christian Slater must be proud of himself, he successfully proved that it is possible to act decent in a film worse then drinking antifreeze. Though all his awful dialog he had to speak, it made me wonder why he just did not walk off the set halfway. Perhaps it was because of Stephen Dorff being in the film as well somebody he wishes he could be but fails at it. Tara Reid is a bad actress but good looking and that is all that really matters in films like these. That is not to say the acting was perfect though, it was average, not good, and perhaps the only thing in the film not good.The Soundtrack Except for Wish I had An Angel, the soundtrack is pointless and bad heavy medal being pumped into the viewers ears, perhaps to disguise the awful story something I will get to soon. A long and very expensive 2 CD soundtrack is now up for sale for those musically challenged.The Directing Directed by Hollywoods favorite director Uwe Ball who brought us the classic House of the Dead. Telling us Yes, movies can get this utterly bad and that is just the beginning to my deadly saga of awful movies. At least it is said to be directed by Uwe Ball. Without being told I would have guessed a monkey was kidnapped from the Congo, brought here and forced to make opinions on how to make the movie under penalty of being shocked. The director of photography was probably a camcorder taped onto a skateboard and pushed forward until it hits a wall. On the scenes where the camera should stay still it is constantly moving, not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should be moving in action, the camera stops for some reason.The Producing Who on earth is stupid enough to put money towards this bomb? I pity the fool... sometimes. Sometimes I am glad he or she was taught such a lesson to never put money towards garbage worse then dog dung tied up in a bag.The Writing  Storyboard Trying to Analise the story is more painful then jamming an ice pick under a big toe and kicking a soccer ball as hard as I possibly could with it right after but I will still attempt it.Edward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 children where to go under science experiments. He escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted this is the point where it got so bad i started to laugh out loud. Then it fastforwards many years later where he is a paranoia detective. He gets attacked by some zombie that cannot be shot to death, kills it and moves on with life. Later on he gets attacked by some crazy looking monster and he discovers secrets that nobody else knows.Yeah, the plot is bad, really really bad. The film beings with expecting us to read approximately 10 minutes, which felt like 100, of random text about an untrue civilization called the Abskani. The film goes not to have one twist after another, more then the audience can handle, more then the audience wants to handle, more then the audience could ever care about. This storyline is rock bottom bad that even Double Dragon does better.Overall, miss out on this movie. I gave it a 1 out of 10 but that is because there is no 0.","label":0},{"index":9915,"txt":"Can it ever be said that there are some movies that have no redeeming features whatsoever?

Do not these guys get it? To anyone who cannot understand, here it is in block capitals for you VIDEO GAMES DO NOT MAKE FOR GOOD MOVIES! The acting here is, at best, substandard. The set design and special effects are poor. Unlike the video game which did have its scary moments the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom, no sense of danger or menace. Pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is printed on would have been better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush. Hackneyed zooms, swoops and pans are spliced into the whole dreary affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience disorientated and bored.

There are no characters, just a few stereotypes wandering around and getting killed. The extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation, and that is about it. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes just began on their own, coming from nowhere with a pounding techno track. While I was watching this movie I kept asking Where is this happening? What is going on? The acting was high school drama quality, with stiff wooden delivery, as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines. Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design. ADR sounded like it was recorded in an open room. The actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks, looking almost robotic in their movements. So, these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios, often without even the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they are there.

The story is based on Sarat Chandras book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original. Well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but not sham creativity. The acting by everyone is affected and the entire movie is a sham. Shekars fathers choice of words in abusing Lolita  Balan  sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again the scene where Shekhar  Saif  slaps Lolita is quite out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters, is quite jarring to the senses, and could have been easily avoided. Similarly the sex scene between Saif and Balan is quite unbecoming the movie and a cheap gimmick to attract the audience. When a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys it is spirit, the work falls apart. The song piyu bole is quite OK. Another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where Saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father. This is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit. On these counts this movie deserves 3 stars. The song and dance by Rekha smacks of artifice and it is a put on. The song is tuneful but I remember having heard it somewhere before and if Iam not mistaken the tune appears to have been plagiarized. Well, agreed the times have changed from then to now.

It stars Richard Widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all.The plot is preposterous. Its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows. One old woman wants to have her drapes put over them, but a lot of the patients want to make their own. And somehow, this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart. It sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children.The questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a reallike lunatic could buy it. Do not get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the acting. The cast following Widmark is composed of other great actors, many of them Academy Awardnominees and winners. And there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly, but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes. Unfortunately, there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus, the movie slows down. A lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint, adhering to the slow pacing and lack of viewing interest.In a short analysis, The Cobweb is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus, which it does pretty quickly.

Also, the subplot involving the overworked husband and wife Widmark and Graham had a lot of promise. However, the script was handled with all the finesse and deftness of a drunk buffalowith bellicose and way over the top scenes again and again in the film. In fact, it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of General Hospital. Subtle, this film as not!! Realistic, this film as not!! While most of the reason this film reeked was the awful script, but I also blame the producers as well for miscasting and misusing come veteran actors. For example, Paul Stewart may not be a household name but this character actor had exceptional talentespecially when playing gangsters in Film Noir movies. Yet here, Stewart is cast as a very nondescript psychiatrist with some bizarre European accentit just did not work since this was well outside his acting range and his character was totally undeveloped and onedimensional. Also, Charles Boyer just seemed hopelessly miscast and totally out of place. Seeing this fine romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heartland of America just seemed bizarre.Overall, this is a rather awful film.

It is not the story of the ghost ship, and I wish they had notified it in the main credits or I would not have watched it, because I really thought it was the film about the legend. It seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship, since the film is listed on the Wikipedia page for the Flying Dutchman legend... I do not understand why. It is maybe based on the resembling legend called The Wandering Jew? Or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend? The film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes. Unfortunately, it is the only battle scene of the film.

It seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another. Coming from a Dutch director, you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece, elements which contributed to make Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoevens film, Flesh  Blood, such a great film. The thought of Flesh  Blood would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straightforward would be good. Unfortunately, and unlike Flesh  Blood, there is no dramatic progression, no fights, no good acting, and put simply, no Flesh and Blood. The photography, as the opening sequence unfolds, is welldone and enticing. This too, stops very early in the film. The music, from Nicola Piovani of La vit\u00e0 e bella fame is repetitive and annoying, when not irrelevant it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence, while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung. Throughout the first act of the film, which lasts nothing less than an hour !, the film takes place within the same perimeter, which is around the farm where the main characters live. The characters play with excrement a lot, drown in it, play in it. A long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character, a young boy who loves to play in excrement, to become older and play in excrement some more. The birdman talks a lot to say foolish things in Italian. Spanish conquistadors speak French. Nothing makes sense. Everything is confused and takes hours to happen. Then there is a second act called the Ship, in which we see what might have been a ship, a long time ago, but which is now remains of a ship covered with excrement did I mention?. The main character, while walking a bit further away from the farm, just happens to run into it, and decides it is really cool so let us live in it. The hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him, but he does not really mind because did I mention? he is not very bright. He thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it, until more conquistadors show up at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the Don Quixote style hats but as I have said it is really confused who is who, make the Dutchman a prisoner, along with the retarded hunchback, and they burn the ship to the ground. The last part of the film, which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middleage peasants fighting in it, takes place in a mad asylum. Yet more torture and drowning each other with feces. Yet more loitering for the director, who seems to have definitely given up on his job, or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job. In the end, a lot of the mentallychallenged new friends that the Dutchman made die. The woman he had sex with who was his brothers wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son. The Dutchman and his son talk. The film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances. Then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends, while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they do not have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses.","label":0},{"index":9928,"txt":"I started to watch this movie with high expectations. However, after one hour I gave up on this movie as it only instilled lots of unanswered questions upon me.

Why did the farmers wife save the Hollander? Why did he, upon being saved, not run for his life instead of starting to make love to the farmers wife? Why did the farmers wife not save the Hollander at a time when the farmer would not be around? Why did these presumably illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why did the Italian comediant know about the Hollanders gold? Why did he hide it in the cesspool in the midst of the evil farmers property?

It is misleading. Maybe a better title would have been The Vanishing Bride or something similar.

Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me hormonally back when I was a student. That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.Corey being the hotty he is, is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief. He is flunking chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and to keep his GPA up she agrees to tutor, but believe no more. So when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it is damaging to his ego. When Berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police, the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just do not believe here. Seviers parents have the wherewithal to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy.Student Seduction which is a misnomer of a title if there ever was one is trash all the way. After the beating that Berkley took for Showgirls this TV film was not an upward career move.","label":0},{"index":9934,"txt":"There are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flicks abundance of clich\u00e9s throughout  and I agree completely, both with regard to the characters AND the dialog.I would read about Elizabeth Berklys awful performance in the equallyawful Showgirls, which I have never seen  and her performance here, while not awful, is barely up to the standards of Lifetimes worse fare. There was not a hint of depth to her character, but then there probably should not have been. If so, it would have placed the film completely outofbalance, since there was not a hint of depth or charisma  not a trace  in any one character, performer, or portrayal.The principals handling of Lizs initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable. Her husbands initial reaction and advice were likewise Forrest Gump, attacking Jennys boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic, intelligent action, and, hell, he was mentallychallenged.The smarmy, unctuous lawyer excuse the redundancy father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time, no mean feat. Her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd, also not unknown in the profession.Finally and frankly, I rather enjoyed this part, the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs, that you would rather depend upon Barney Fife, without Andy, to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community. I know that most reallike cops fall a bit short of the sharpness, intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the Law and Order series, and the like  but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on Lifetime.Finally, I found a kind of story within a story fascination with Joshs concoction of his being the victim of his teacher. This scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story. This was something of an achievement, like going from F to Fminus.This whole lame situation should have been resolved  in real life  in about 15 minutes, following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities, with husband involved. But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following, and left an hours blank film in the camera. But the writers here, proved with their ending, they could do even worse. When the situation was finally resolved and righted, this was accomplished in all of about 45 seconds, with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any real world context for the perpetrator and his parents, or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption.This ones a 2 presentation; the second  because it does have some mild fascination.","label":0},{"index":9935,"txt":"Is there anything that happens in this movie that is NOT predictable? I think not. Basically the movie is clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9 and really nothing ever comes as a surprise. It makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension. So for a thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also as a drama it is a failure. This is because the movie its story is highly unlikely. I mean, no way this could ever happen in real life, as in the same way as the events occur in this movie. So the movie has a real suspense and credibility problem.But it truly are the clich\u00e9s that killed the movie. It was cringing stuff at times. Everything is so formulaic in this movie. The predator is portrayed as a cool heartless, almost psychopath like sexual frustrated boy and the victim as a naive young woman, who acts like she did not see any of this coming. Everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and all seemed to happen for a reason. Such as the sequence in which the predator fixes the victims broken car. That has got to be one of the oldest clich\u00e9s out of the book. I knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point. I tried to look as if the teacher and the student were really growing toward each other trough the eyes of the other persons around them. It was so incredibly obvious and cheap that I almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point. The movie is filled with moments like these.The title might suggest that this is a cheap porn movie but this in fact is a sappy made for TV movie. Which means that everything is slowly happening and the movie spends halve its time on character development and unnecessary subplots to make the movie even more drama like.I will admit that Elizabeth Berkley is pretty good acting in this movie. She makes some of the clich\u00e9s and events look even almost realistic at times. Her Hollywood career is as good as over after appearing in the Paul Verhoeven movie Showgirls, so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies and television series like this one. It is a waste of her talent and she surely deserves better. All of the other characters are a disappointment. Corey Sevier plays the clich\u00e9 pretty untouchable rich boy and the way the husband of the main character is portrayed is even worse. He looks more like a sexual frustrated predator than the true predator of the movie. He basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence. He wakes up, he wants sex. Before he goes to sleep, he wants sex. He gets home, he wants sex. It might be a realistic thing but I do not know, it just did not feel right for a movie like this one and the story in general.A clich\u00e9 filled movie and I cannot think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie. It is predictable and therefor also lacks in suspense and credibility. Not an horrible movie and it certainly is a watchable one at times but all the weak and clich\u00e9 elements in the movie also make this far from a recommendable one.410","label":0},{"index":9936,"txt":"Unless you are twelve, this movie really is not worth it.

When you are young, you are not too critical of flexing rubber swords, campy acting, and scenes that are repeated. At least two scenes are repeated identically in the movie, just as was done in oldtime serials in order to bring the audience up to speed. Finally, kids are usually more accepting of American English dialogue coming out of the mouths of Asian actors. Not to mention the fact that several of the leading roles are played by nonAsian actors. I was going to give this movie three stars, but I felt like the director, producers, and cast deserved some extra credit for at least carrying through on the project.

There are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie. For example, Madea beats the foster child with a belt in a comedic manner, to convince the child to straighten out. The child does, in fact, turn herself around. Apparently, it pays to beat children.There are plots dealing with child rape with the consent of the mother. There are scenes with old men ogling young girls who are related to them. The ogling takes place at a family reunion. The movie jumps from plot to plot such that you are always offbalance.

I kept believing therefore that he did not get the part because he was a lousy actor; not because a bigger name was available. Then when we see portions of the play in rehearsal it is difficult to believe the director is not parodying things with a hopelessly miscast, misdirected travesty of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and directors who see the play through their own screwball interpretations.

A bus driver asks a woman out by harassing her while he is making his rounds. I could not believe it. I really could not believe when she agreed to go out with him even more.

I do not use this term lightly, but that woman only had two modes. Morose victim and psycho momma. No matter which of these two faces she showed, however, there was one constant. The bus driver was not going to get any. He even married her without sampling the goodsWTF! Then there is the family reunion scene.

Unfortunately for these killer tomatoes they could not stand up to the laugh riot that is the Scary Movie franchise. While I fought boredom here watching jokes that were silly and stupid, brutally dated and brutally bad, the more recent parody had me laughing out loud. How could I desire any more than that. Director John De Bello uses the basic premise that some sort of growth hormone has gone terribly wrong and turned the tomatoes into killers. But his main objective here is to slap around the disaster movie genre that was so big back in the day. The script reeks of stoner humor, and perhaps if you take illegal substances with your movie nights this could be your cup of tea. I, sober, was stuck watching a grown man go under cover as a tomato. And that one joke, that is never funny, where the discrepancy between the Japanese speaking actor and the voice over is also here. Some may giggle, I did not. They even had a Hitler joke that was not funny, and I thought all Hitler jokes were funny.The narrative of this film is so splintered for no good reason that it is nearly impossible to explain. Tomatoes kill people, the government tries to stop it, bad jokes are told. Their aim may have been correct as their targets include the media, consumerism, and paranoia three things that still control our lives today. Oddly enough the main selling point of this film, those gosh darn tomatoes, really do not make much of an appearance. And when they do, get this, they are played by real tomatoes. That washed up gimmick did nothing for me as I get very little out of watching a pack of tomatoes devour a body thanks to the magic of stop action camera tricks. There is also a fear of going for broke at work here that prevents this film from being truly funny. The gag of having somebody fall asleep in nearly every scene may please some audience members, but more than likely it will be seen as an invitation to join in the fun.I might also add that there does seem to be some old fashioned human egotism at work here. Man eats tomato and that is dinner, tomato eats man and that is a worldwide catastrophe. But that is just the way the world works. In the film the produce becomes evil because of genetic modification, but in the real world our produce see Taco Bell becomes evil thanks to neglect. And like those evil doin green onions this films shelf life expired a long time ago. There are a few good chuckles to be had. The last shot was really quite splendid, but it was nowhere near enough to save this moderate stink bomb.

Other than that the movie is really just scenes of little tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people acting scared and overacting as people should do in a movie of this type. However, just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song do not a good comedy make. Granted this movie is supposed to be a B movie, nothing to be taken seriously, however, you should still make jokes that are funny and not try to extend a mildly amusing premise into a full fledged movie. Perhaps a short would have been fine as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to gun down a larger tomato was actually pretty good.

Finletter who is never pictured without his parachute trailing behind Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes is a parody of BMovies, in particular Japanese horror of the 1950s. The film begins with a standard sized tomato being discovered by a women washing up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the tomato has supposedly murdered this lady, and let me tell you it does not get any saner as the film progresses! To be fair there are a couple of funny moments, for instance anytime the Japanese scientist Dr Nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed over in an American accent, or when disguise expert Sam Smith infiltrates the tomatoes hey, can somebody please pass the ketchup?. Equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole so bad its good concept. Unfortunately for Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes spoof films such as the Airplane and Naked Gun series have been released and done this kind of comedy a lot better since.The acting is atrocious; there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy. For a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once, one gag after the over. The singing in the film seems pointless and the adverts for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre, even for this film.

It is an inescapable certainty, as this is one of the most notoriously awful cult movies ever made. One tiny but essential detail, however, is that Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is deliberately awful. Right from the opening message already, mocking Alfred Hitchcocks The Birds, this is clearly intended as a zerobudgeted parody and I cannot escape the impression that writerdirector John De Bello never expected for his film to become such a hit. The film spoofs the contemporary popular trend of socalled ecohorror movies plants, animals and nature in general revolting against humanity and introduces the least menacing type of vegetable imaginable as undefeatable killing machines. A secret government agricultural project to produce bigger and tastier tomatoes goes horribly wrong and soon there are reports about tomatoattacks coming from all over the country. The president puts together a Special Forces team to battle the juicy enemy, which includes secret agents with very specific areas of expertise and scientists with horrendously dubbed voices. The first half hour of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is very entertaining. As silly as it is, the sight of normally shaped vegetables jumping up from the sink and attacking hysterical housewives is quite original and funny. The first half hour also contains numerous memorable moments like the catchy theme song, the Jaws homage and the infamous unforeseen helicopter crash see the trivia section for more details that made it to the final cut. After that, however, the whole thing turns into a tedious, unstructured and insufferably amateurish mess. The quality level of the jokes goes from fresh and inventive towards embarrassing and downright not funny and there are too many characters and sub plots. Personally, I prefer the late 80s and early 90s sequels which I saw before seeing the original because they benefit from slightly better production values, incredibly overthetop tomato special effects and the presence of veteran actor John Astin The Addams Family as the mad scientist Dr. Gangreen. But, as said before already, the original inexplicably remains obligatory viewing material at some point in your life.","label":0},{"index":9964,"txt":"The easiest way to describe this movie is as a satire. The target of the satire is quite vast, from the US Government to corporate America. It is also not a stinging satire, but rather a silly one.Think of this movie as a mix between the Kentucky Fried movie, Airplane and Police Squad series, done with a much smaller budget and not as funny. I can see how this movie is a satire of many scifi disaster movies from the 50s and 60s. I see this movie as a big influence on Tim Burtons Mars Attacks.The plot is simple enough. Genetically engineered giant tomatoes go crazy and start attacking people and cities. At first there is a cover up and then it blows over into full blown war.The movie runs the gamut of characters and characterizations  Lois Fairchild a Lois Lane clone, a very ambitious Presidential Press Secretary, Clark Kent, Mason Dixon FIA agent who has not worked since the Bay of Pigs, a useless President who only seems to be able to sign his name and attack New York, an even inept Congress, a sleazy marketing CEO, and Masons team consisting of an obese East German female swimmer, a scuba diver, a crazed WWII paratrooper and an AfricanAmerican disguise expert disguised as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and finally as a tomato. Did I also forget to mention, lots and lots of tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes from small tomatoes, to giant plastic tomatoes, to smashed tomatoes, to tomato juice and finally to people dressed up as tomatoes.On top of all this, you have a couple of musical numbers as well. They are not that good and seem to be dubbed. The best tune is by far the theme of the movie Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. It is way too catchy and you might end up humming or singing it in public. Be warned.Most of the movie is quite amusing and shows the absurdity of various real life situations as well as various entertainment genres.

It is a Bmovie actionflick, by the director of Commando, that is however far too lame and silly to consider it a good Bmovie with enough entertainment value in it.It is an 90s flick but foremost the movie should remind of an 80s action movie, when these type of Bmovies were at an all time high. These movies always went overthetop and never paid much attention to its story or acting. It was all about blowing stuff up, big muscle heroes and bullets flying around. This movie has all of that ingredients in it but yet I really did not liked watching this movie as much as I like watching some similar type of movies. Hard to say why really, since the story and acting and such are just as bad as would be the case in basically any other genre movie from the same era.It is probably because the movie is being often far too silly. All these type of movies have its silly moments but this movie is just filled with it. The fighting, Dolph Lundgren running around shirtless, the characters, the story. It all just is not very good because it is often just too lame for words. The story at times is not even trying to make a bit sense and what is even the main plotline of the overall movie? Its story is all over the place really and seems only to be written to create a movie out of with fighting sequences, gun fights and such. And those sequences are not even much good to watch really. The moments are way too short and quite disappointing to watch really, from the man who brought us Commando.It is foremost a Dolph Lundgren, in which he gets to play the big action hero star, who kicks butt with seemingly relative ease, knows how to handle guns and other weapons and of course also gets the girl, played by Tia Carrere. This all also brings us one of the worst montage sequence in action movie history and also definitely one of the worst sex sequence I have seen in any movie really. Both are just too lame for words and just very poorly put together.None of the characters work out really. The good guys are cops but they never seem to behave like one. They simply kill around without having to face responsibility to anyone and they are not very keen on making any arrest, or to inform anyone about their discoveries. Not even when they find out a big Japanese crime syndicate is trying to take over the streets of L.A. and a beer brewery is working as a cover for a drugs factory and large scale drugs smuggling.

Then Brandon Lee enters the story and the oneliners start flying, the plot falls apart, the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out it is welcome, as it turns into the worst action movie EVER.Lungren beats out his previous efforts in The Punisher and others, as well as all of Van Dammes movies, Seagals movies, and Stallones nonRocky movies, for this distinct honor. This movie has the absolute worst acting check out Tia Carreres face when she is in any scene with Dolph, that is worth a laugh, with the worst dialogue ever Brandon Lees comment about little Dolph is the worst line ever in a film, and the worst outfit in a film Dolph in full Japanese attire.

If you are in a lighthearted mood and need a very hearty laugh, this is the movie for you. Now without further ado, my reviewThis movie was found in a bargain bin at WalMart. That should be the first clue as to how good of a movie it is. Secondly, it stars the lame actionstar Dolph Lundgren. That should be the second clue as to how good of a movie it is. I am still shocked that it was even put on DVD who would waste their money doing such a thing?, though as you might imagine, there are not any extras or bonus footage on the DVD. In fact, there is not even a menu; the movie just starts playing.First, the writer for this movie deserves to be tortured and killed. It has one of the worst scripts ever written and is plagued with terrible oneliners; remarkably unbelievable, fake dialogue; and inappropriate comments like Lees comment on Lundgrens. err. manhood, which I will mention later. There is not one single sincere sounding line in the entire movie. The dialogue and plot go handinhand, as the script and plot both progress in an entirely nonsensical fashion. The two cops hate each other for no apparent reason at the beginning, and then for again no reason at all, Lees character pulls over to the side of the road, runs around to the other side of the car, and says I am not going to let you go alone, ecause despite myself, I like you! And I do not want to see you get killed! . or something to that extent, anyhow. There are disgusting oneliners, mostly said by Lee. For instance, when duking it out with a bad guy, Lee says You have the right to remain silent . You have the right to be dead! Lastly, I will mention the entirely inappropriate and nonsensical comment that Lee makes about Lundgrens netherregions. When bad guys start to attack after a seemingly random love scene between Lundgren and Carrere, and Lundgren decides to fight them off in his underwear, Lee says to him Incase we die, I just wanted to let you know that you have the biggest dick I have ever seen on a guy. . Yes, he actually says that. It makes no sense and is not even possible Lee never actually sees Lundgren naked, so how would he know?, but the writer threw it in the script anyway. The entire movie looks like some kind of action video game, and Lee even admits it. After Lee and the underwearonly Lundgren defeat all of those bad guys, Lee makes a comment that is also truly beautiful Wow, this is sort of like a video game; we just defeated the first wave!Second, the plot of this movie is despicable. It suffers, in my opinion, mainly from the fact that it just does not exist. The trailer for this movie  which IMDb has available for viewing, by the way  makes it sound like the movie is about two cops trying to stop the Japanese Yakuza from taking over Lost Angeles. This is extremely misleading, however, since the movie has practically nothing to do with that at all. They make very brief, vague references to the Yakuza trying to start up a methamphetamine business with local drug dealers, but the entire movie ACTUALLY revolves around a poorlywritten attempt for Kenner Lundgrens character to revenge the death of his parents, whom the Yakuza leader named Yoshida killed when he was only 9 years old. The entire plot can basically be summed up like this Yoshida wants Kenner dead, Kenner wants Yoshida dead, and the two try two kill each other. And of course all the while Kenners sarcastic sidekick named Johnny and played by Brandon Lee acts like an ignorant idiot, and Tia Carrere gets naked. twice.The acting is one of the worst parts of the entire movie. The dialogue is so unrealistic, and their entirely insincere portrayal of it emphasizes this even more. You would expect poor acting from action stars anyway, but this movie highlights some of the most unimaginably bad acting ever recorded.Finally we get to the heart of the movies baseness the flagrantly bad action. There are so many astoundingly bad, unrealistic action sequences in this movie, it is just downright impressive they managed to fit them all in. Although Lee has his fair share of bad scenes as well, most of the truly terrible action involves Lundgren. For instance, Lundgren nonchalantly takes on four or five kung fu bad guys onehanded, without spilling his tea. Then, when surprised by an oncoming speeding car, Lundgren casually leaps over it. Or how about when he reaches THROUGH a closed door, grabs the villain on the other side, pulls him back through the door, and beats him up? Or when he picks up Tia Carrere, gently walks not runs backward through a glass door that shatters around him, and leaps down a onestory height with Tia still in arm, only to then lift up an entire car without the slightest effort and uses it as a barricade to shield them from bullets? All of the shameless gunfights are terrible as well, with Lundgren and Lee killing every bad guy instantaneously, while the rain of bullets from their fifty attackers never seem to hit either of them. That is, of course, until the final fight scene of the movie. Lundgren gets shot point blank in his bare chest in a region that even if it did manage to miss his heart, would still immediately begin to fill lungs with blood and kill him within a matter of seconds. Despite this, Lundgren remains in topnotch condition and manages to duke it out in the middle of a parade with Yoshida, the evil super villain. And of course the passing people in the parade dressed as samurai are carrying REAL, fully sharpened katanas, which the two use to sword fight. Now in addition to his bullet wound, Lundgren gets several deep slices in his chest and arms. Does this stop him? No, of course not! In fact, a few seconds later after easily killing the evil Yoshida who gets pinned to a dartboardlike wheel and then bursts into flames for no reason, Lundgren casually walks off with Tia and Lee as if he was not injured at all. God, it is terrible.All of these factors are then mixed up with an entirely unnecessary, gratuitous nude scene every five minutes, including topless women at a party, the beheading of a topless woman, women at a strip club, nude women at a Japanese spa, and the pointless hot tub and love scene with Tia. Not to mention the trip to the bizarre sushi bar, at which rich Japanese men are eating sushi off of naked women. Which, by the way, prompts Lee to say with much fake enthusiasm that after defeating the bad guys he and Lundgren will go eat fish off those naked chicks! Which, of course, is followed by a disturbing high five. And we cannot forget the terrible editing either, like when the villains are crushing a man trapped in a car at a junk yard, and the editors left in a really obvious glimpse of a prop dummy. The credits also list an enormous list of stunt workers, which implies that a lot of the action probably was not done by the movie stars after all.In the end, this movie repeatedly outdoes it self with brazen badness. It is illogical and impossible, and as a result, remarkably entertaining. If you are looking for any kind of thoughtful cinema, this movie will make you want to die. If you are looking for a good laugh and a good time mocking bad movie making, this movie will delight you. As an actual movie, I will merit this movie a 0.5 out of 10. As an entertaining way to waste an hour and eighteen minutes, however, this beauty takes the cake.","label":0},{"index":9973,"txt":"I am commenting on this miniseries from the perspective of someone who read the novel first. And from that perspective I can honestly say that while enjoyable, I can see why it has not been rebroadcast anytime recently. More specifically, this mini has some serious problems, such as1 It is terribly miscast. The actors who played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters. Ali McGraw 45 at the time was playing Natalie Jastrow who was supposed to be about 26. JanMichael Vincent 39 at the time was playing Byron Henry who was supposed to be about 22. The other Henry children, and Pamela Tudsbury, were also played by actors way too old for characters who were supposed to be in their 20s.2 Some of the acting was absolutely awful. Ali McGraw at times almost made this mini unwatchable. I have seen more convincing performances in high school plays. 3 The directing was poor. To be fair to Ali McGraw, the bad acting and character development were probably the directing. The portrayal of Hitler was way overdone. His character came off looking and behaving more like a cartoon villain than the charismatic, sometimes charming, but always diabolical genius Herman Wouk painted him as in the novel. Some of the other characters are done so stereotypically Berel Jastrow they do not gain the depth of character that Wouk created for them.4 This mini is very dated. The hokey music, the pretentious narration it sounded like a junior high school history film narration, and the entire primetime soap opera feel of the mini made it almost comical at times. Also, too often Byron and Natalie are costumed and made up to look like they are in 1979 rather than 1939.Someone who watches this without the benefit of reading the novel first will probably not sit through it all, because it will come off more as a late 70s  early 80s take myself too seriously primetime soap drama, rather than the television version of what is certainly a modern American classic.Remakes of older movies and the like are sometimes poorly done, but this is probably one case where a creative and inspired director could make a very stunning, memorable, and critically acclaimed production. I do not ever see that happening since a remake would have to be just as long 15 hours or longer to do it right, and given the short attention span of most of the current American viewing public, it would not fly.","label":0},{"index":9974,"txt":"....this mini does not get better with age.

Otherwise, everything else in this lackluster production is new and not worth watching. In fact, the director has written here at IMDb.COM that he directed only eight minutes of Journey to the Center of the Earth and the studio tacked on part of Dollman helmer Albert Pyuns sequel to his own Alien from L.A. with Kathy Ireland. Evidently, the producers ran out of money and to satisfy overseas contractual obligations, they grafted Pyuns sequel onto director Rusty Lemorandes movie. Please, do not rent or buy this wretched piece of garbage.Unlike director Henry Levins period piece Journey to the Center of the Earth 1959 with James Mason and Pat Boone, Lemorandes Journey to the Center of the Earth takes place in contemporary times in Hawaii. Two fellows, a British nanny, and a dog are brought together for the adventure of a lifetime purely by coincidence. Richard Paul Carafotes of Blind Date and his comic book obsessed brother Bryan Ilan MitchellSmith of Weird Science are going out to explore a cave. The heroine, Crystina Nicola Cowper of Underworld, works for a domestic service called Nannies R Us. Being a nanny has been Crystinas lifelong dream, but she has made a less of all five of her nanny jobs. Nevertheless, her sympathetic supervisor, Ms. Ferry Lynda Marshall of Africa Express, sends her to Hawaii. Crystinas new client, rock star Billy Foul Jeremy Crutchley of Doomsday who is scheduling one last concert to revive his flagging career, has a dog named Bernard. Foul wants Crystina to take Bernard to a doggie day spa. Crystina is waiting on the arrival of her taxi when a careless motel attendant accidentally puts the basket that conceals Bernard in Richards jeep. You see, Foul has hidden his canine in a basket because motel management strictly prohibits pets on their premises. Foul has disguised the dog as a human baby. Anyway, Crystina catches a cab and tells the driver follow Richard.After she catches up with them to get her dog, the cabbie cruises away and abandons her. Crystina demands that Richard drive her back to town, but he has other plans. Unhappily, Crystina joins the guys and they get lost, and then find themselves in the lost city of Atlantis, a police state ruled by a dictator, at the center of the Earth. The rulers of Atlantis repeatedly notify their citizens that life on the surface does not exist. Our heroes and heroine stumble onto Atlantis quite by accident. Atlantis resembles a disco and everybody looks like they are straight out of a punk rock opera. The ruler of Atlantis, General Rykov Janet Du Plessis of Operation Hit Squad, is orchestrating a raid on the surface with clones of the first human, Wanda Saknussemm Kathy Ireland of Necessary Roughness, to visit Atlantis. Predictably, General Rykov machinations to rule Atlantis and overthrow the Earth fails, and our heroes and heroine save the day.Journey to the Center of the Earth is an abomination. The movie seems to be a comedy despite its superficial satire about dictatorships.

For example, the aliens asks the British girl if she is an alien and she explains that the Ministry should be sending her work visa shortly. Or when the alien girl finds Bryan and explains that he is in the city of Altantis and he mistakes this for Atlantic City, New Jersey.

We formed our own opinion instead of being force fed a view of them through constant bickering.In the end there is too much going on and it detracts greatly from what could have been an enjoyable piece of escapism.

The impressive screenwriting acrobatics cannot overcome the bad filmmaking.As if a ridiculous chase sequence was not bad enough, one which has four separate sections and could last close to half an hour, was not bad enough, Joe Gavilan fields calls about his real estate deal while chasing the perpetrator with a gun. All these extracurricular plot lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether or not the criminal gets caught. We already forgot or no longer care about the murder plot at this point because multiple plotlines and eye candy of the chases have numbed us beyond all comprehension.While I could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story, I will not. This could have been a very enjoyable formula film but it got much too big for its britches and it turned into a redundant waste of time. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett actually did rather well and a small appearance by Gladys Knight is worth noting. Sadly none of the actors can help this hopelessly misguided film from being forgettable.While this will probably be better than the likes of The Hulk and Lara Croft II that still does not make this film good. I once heard that Harrison Ford claimed to only make films that eh thought would make money, I am not sure if that is true or not.

Making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of Hollywood itself is sure a good idea but the final result of that turned out to be not at least a spoof of the subgenre but a reason to ask God to have mercy upon all the past movies of the same kind whereas the worst of them was by all means greater than Hollywood Homicide.What really did happen to this entertaining formula ?! Since a whole decade the things had not been the same. You would have a buddyaction stubborn flop after another.

Why can IA pick up the buddy cops and then just let them answer their phones or pretend to be Indian mystics and then just let them waltz out of there without so much as a slap on the wrist?

Attack of the Sabretooth is about a new vacation resort where the proprietors are genetically engineering Smilodon cats for an attraction. The cats escape and begin to kill people, the guy running the show wants to save them and not warn the unsuspecting visitors about them, and there is a band of visitors and some employees who rebel and plan to kill the cats.Special effectswise, the film is about an average achievement given its budget. The sabretooths are portrayed through poor CGI. Amazingly, though, the cats look more realistic in an upclose, detailed shot rather than the longer, more distant shots where the CGI is better concealed. Their attacks are recklessly bloody and distasteful. Just as you would expect, they attack, rip off some arms and legs, and leave very little behind. This is part of the reason why the film descends into poor schlock.The plot and characters are just as horrendous. We have some college kids who come to the island and they plan a scavenger hunt. And take it very, VERY seriously. Even so much as to trespass on private property, tamper with security systems, and steal. Why are they taking a simple game so seriously? Did I miss something?

At one point, which very may well have been the WORST point, a computer generated Saber Tooth of gold falls from the roof stabbing the idiot creator of the cats in the mouth...uh, ooookkkk. The villain of the movie was a paralyzed sabretooth that was killed within minutes of its first appearance. The other two manages to kill a handful of people prior to being burned and gunned down. Then, there is a random one awaiting victims in the jungle...which scares me for one sole reason. Will there be a Part Two? God, for the sake of humans everywhere I hope not.This movie was pure garbage. From the power point esquire credits to the slide show ending.","label":0},{"index":9998,"txt":"This movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never had made a movie before nor had they considered that a script should be edited or even funny. When I saw this film, I saw it for John Candy and assumed, incorrectly, that it would be hilarious. Instead, there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat, unfunny moments. And, to top it off, Candy delivered some of the crudest lines I had ever heard up to that time. So, despite a potentially funny cast and story idea, we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult, though teens will probably find a few laughs. It is really a shameit could have been so much better. I mean, with Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy it SHOULD have been wonderful.","label":0},{"index":9999,"txt":"This movie was the worst movie ever made on the planet, I like BARNEY more than this movie. The graphics suck, half the movie is animated, the deaths suck, and over all, I was ready to SUE the people that made this movie!PLEASE DO NOT WASTE HOURS OF YOUR LIFE WATCHING THIS MOVIE. The only good part was when the movie  ended! This movie is 50 percent Jurassic park, .1 percent Sabretooth, and 49.9 percent DUMB! Please do not waste your time watching this movie, you will regret it.You want to know why this movie sucks? Well, the cover sucked, the graphics sucked, the blood looked  I mean is ketchup, the people tried to blow themselves up, the college students think there all that and can stand up to the animal. I mean, there was a 5 ft. tiger running straight at a woman, she throws a spear at it from 100 ft away! WAIT TILL YOU CAN Actually HIT IT! The acting was horrible too. Jurrasic Park is actually a good movie, and this just had to go and ruin it.","label":0}]}
