They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE, and free of charge, you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters, eventually striking paydirt and fashioning a homemade Dr. Frankensteinstyled cancerstick, all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of Aqua Velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise.

I thought, hey this could be interesting, then I found out how absolutely, insanely, ridiculously stupid it really was.

Then it rewards the winner money. If they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters, even better. While the game format is in slow motion versus Beat The Clock the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality. This show has elements of several types of successful past programs. Reality television, hardly, but if your hooked on the contestants, locale or contest, this is your cup of tea. If your not, this entire series is as I say, drivel dripping with gravy. It is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000.It is slick  well produced, so it might last a while yet.

Its a huge let down after the classic Tarzan and His Mate which is possibly the best film in the series.The plot has Janes cousins coming into the jungle to tell her that she has inherited a fortune if she will come back to claim it. They are kind of in the bind since the relative that left her the money cut them out of the will.Hiring a great white hunter, who secretly wishes to capture Tarzan and sell him, the pair heads into the jungle where they run into the usual jungle troubles more so because of the stock footage. After lots of talk Jane decides to go back to civilization and we get long sequences of Tarzan and Jame making kissy face. Finally into the last half hour the plot to capture Tarzan is put in motion and things at last become interesting as plans go awry and things look very grim for all concerned..Painfully dull film is clear evidence of a troubled production. the film seems to have been assembled from several different films with the first half hour playing as an almost exact repeats of the previous film. The middle third shows signs of having to stretch things out and having plot lines that ultimately went nowhere. The last third where Tarzan is captured and the party is put into peril is the point that the film finally comes to life it also shows signs of the graphic violence that caused much of the need to reshoot the film. To me its a great wonder how the series managed to continue on from here since this film is not very good except at the end.I would be hard pressed to explain it except I would have to say that it was the relationship between Weissmuller and OSullivan as Tarzan and Jane which kept people coming back. Its a beautifully acted pairing and really is one of the screens great couples.I should probably also mention that this is the point that the film became less real and more fantastical with the appearance of the Tarzan tree house. I really dislike the first hour or so of this film a great deal and find it a great waste of time and energy. If you can come in towards the end I would recommend giving the film a try. Otherwise I would just skip the whole film and move on to the next film in the series.","label":0},{"index":8005,"txt":"Another horror flick in which a goofball teenager battles a madman and his supernatural sidekick who want to take over?!

The special effects are tacky, the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraphs! The Brain takes place in a typical quietAmerican town setting, where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the coolkid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet. It is here that a TVguru named Dr. Blake and his adorable petbrain begin their quest for nationwide mind controlling. Under the label of independent thinkers, a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill! How cool is that? Now, it is up to the Meadowvale teenrebel to save the world! The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr. Blake and his monstrous brain actually come from. There are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that is about it. Meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really? There is not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the evil brain looks like an oversized sockpuppet. The only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same men who made Bloody Birthday guilty pleasure of mine and Plague. Both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry. The most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great David Gale, whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in ReAnimator. A girl named Christine Kossak provides the nudityfactor and she is obviously a great talent\u0085 She has exactly 3 movies on her repertoire of which THIS is her masterpiece. In her debut, she was credited as runaway model and in 3 men and a baby, her character is referred to as one of Jacks girls.

He uses this T.V. show to hypnotise the viewers and make them commit acts of violence. Dr. Blake has the help of a large brain with an evil face that uses it is spinal cord as a tail thingy. Usually the brain is just sitting in a tank, eats mice and the odd bad actor, each time it eats someone it gets much bigger. Meanwhile at the local highschool gifted but troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski Tom Bresnahan has been caught putting Sodium down the toilets. Jim is sent to Dr. Blake at the PRI for help with his attitude and behavioural problems. While there Dr. Blake hooks Jim up to, well something I am not actually sure what. This whatever it is, is attached to the brain. At first Jim is able to resist the brains mind control. The brain feels that Jim is a threat to itself and it is plans. Once out of the PRI Jim starts having bizarre hallucinations and crashes his car. Jim makes it to his waitress girlfriend Janet Cynthia Preston as Cyndy Preston but is handed back to Dr. Blakes assistant Verna George Buza soon after by Officer Marks Harry Booker. The brain wants to kill Jim because he is the only one capable of withstanding it is mind control techniques, and with Independent Thinkers going national the brain does not want anything or anyone to stop it is evil plan for world domination! Jim quickly realises that the brain is controlling the entire town and he alone must stop the brain, before it takes over the world!Directed by Ed Hunt who calls himself Edward Hunt here, the Brain was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Do not get me wrong as it certainly is not great either. The script by Barry Pearson tries a stab at satire with the brain washing and mind control by T.V. storyline. It moves along at a fair pace and is not too boring. No explanation is given for the existence of the brain at all, it is just there and that is it we have to accept it. The story is a little choppy and never fully explores one single element, there is the T.V. mind control, the brain itself, Jim being hunted by the police  his misbehaviour and various other little bits and pieces here and there including a bizarre revelation regarding Dr. Blake that is not explained at all. Production wise this film looks cheap, and probably was cheap. The acting is not great but I have seen worse, and what is David Gale doing in this? In fact this role is similar to Gales role in ReAnimator 1985 even down to his characters deaths in both films. The brain itself at first sits in a tank and starts to grow whenever it eats someone and by the end it is pretty big. Each stage is just made of rubber. It does not look particularly good and is not scary or creepy, just cheap. There is no blood or gore in it apart from a blink and you will miss it decapitation. The nudity is provided by Dr. Blakes assistant Vivian Christine Kossak as Christine Kossack before she gets eaten. The brain had a certain entertainment value for me but I would think most people would dislike it.

Because I do not have a clue who these people are and I do not know if I should want them to live or die.

Basically, some women and her friends get locked in the London Underground, get chased by a weird creature, then they eventually escape from it.Creep has its moments which make you jump, the art is good, the location is excellent and the sounds are OK, but that is not what makes a decent horror film, so unfortunately all that goes to waste.It is nothing new.

The Brain itself is gloriously goofylooking, but it mostly just sits on its little platform. Who thought that it would be cool that the Brain only gets to munch on three people throughout 94 drawnout minutes? This movie has a number of things going for it at first, including an Estevezknockoff lead playing a rebellious genius we are told that his enormous intellect is misdirected into his elaborate pranks and school stunts, which include putting krazy glue on someones chair. It also has some great lines, a hilariously outofshape and outofbreath henchman who just barely manages to be everywhere, and, yeah, some chick gets naked. However, the director desperately needs some schooling in the art of pacing. During the last half things just start to drag on and on, with at least 3 or 4 pointless, boring chase scenes making up the middle third of the plot. The scenes inside the PRI complex are especially bad. At least 15 minutes of this movie are people running up and down the same stairwell. I could have fixed the screenplay to this thing in half an hour more cheese, more gore, more nudity, more Brain action. If you are going to make a bad horror movie, at least give me something cool to look at while my superego shuts down.

In terms of quality, they tend to range from fairly good to unwatchable trash; and unfortunately, Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the latter. The plot is just your average story of a witch, wizard or as is the case here warlock, who is put to death  but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it...etc etc. We then get a s\u00e9ance and one thing leads to another, and pretty soon the executed warlock is up to no good again. The plot is slow, painfully boring and the film constantly feels pointless. The characters string out reams of diatribe and it never serves the film in any way whatsoever. Paul Naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me he should stick to acting because the dialogue is trite in the extreme, and only serves to make the film even more boring than it already is. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil provides dull direction here, which likes the dialogue does nothing to help the film.

I mean the movie is only 88 minutes long and I kept thinking When is it going to end? The characters in the movie are idiots for the most part and they pretty much deserve to die for being really stupid. The villain is also very bad as he is slow moving and really you wonder how he manages to do anything considering he is afraid of jewelery. The only thing to keep you watching after the head is reattached is the fact that there are so many boobs being flashed that you really begin to lose track. Still I want to see a horror movie, not a soft core porn flick and as a horror movie it is way to slow moving with way to many slow stretches to be even somewhat enjoyable. And do not read the back of the box as it made it out like there were flesh eating zombies attacking the town, there is not...only a small scene where three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily repelled they are not a factor in the movie at all and their scene is rather pointless.

The horror in question is a wicked Medieval magician played by Spanish horror legend Paul Naschy looking like he is playing Abanazer in a church hall panto.

Like all good magicians, Abanazer here has a lovely assistant. This ones played by another Spanish horror great, the beautiful Helga Line. Like practically every other woman in the film Line periodically gets her kit off. There is a LOT of nudity in this film, and not just female  we even get to see Naschys paunchy body, which is not a pretty sight, I can tell you. Most of the films sex angle is laughably gratuitous. There is one particularly funny scene where Naschy and Line discuss their evil plans and then suddenly decide to both have a grope of the nubile young blonde they have possessed.It is also pretty gory in places  notably a Herschell Gordon Lewisesquire moment where Line plunges her hands into a mans chest to remove his heart.The best part of the film is the pretty effective zombies who turn up towards the end. They are quickly scared off by a fire though, and do not bother coming back. Which is a shame. The scene where the zombies rise, however, is the films most ludicrously inept moment. It all happens in long shot, and we have not really got a clue what is happening until we see some figures shambling on from the distance. There are several rubbish moments like this, thanks largely to poor editing. When a labourer falls under the hypnotic spell of Naschys head there is a big close up of his face that seems to last forever and serves no purpose whatsoever.All in all, not a great horror film, but entertaining enough.

She gets an audition at the bar they work at and surprise! The place is completely full of two year old toddlers bursting at the sight of babes dancing.The story is not bad and some characters are likeable, especially Cammie the fashion coordinator part was cute and the bouncer but let us face it, the drama was horrible and completely laughable from the beginning. Violet and her father looked far too ridiculous while they were relating throughout the movie. And check out Violet too jamming on that keyboard with the break dancer!For the first time I could think of, how could the production be so terrible? For a brief moment with this movie, Hollywood could stand on its two feet and show a new low without any major public outcry without saying, You were warned! Instead, it seems COYOTE UGLY has a purposeful intent on trying to kiss every major rear in the world. Advertising babes in a bar, but showing a paper thin pursue your dream story disappointed every male teen you targeted!And finally, the music. There was absolutely no break of music I found in this movie, especially when it was needed the hospital scene. Every scene felt like some short music video you just wish would stop until the bar opened. But the climax was an ultimate laugher an 80s like song you would expect Cyndi Lauper to jump on the stage and jam with Violet. Heck, I personally thought Bon Jovi was going to jump out with the long hair and jam too!Other than some really smart camera work with the coyote girls when dancing especially the wet scene, and a couple cute cliches, COYOTE UGLY is something to be purely embarrassed about.

There are two routes to take in horror films either you do not really explain what is going on or who the killer is, like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained Halloween could potentially be an example of this.Unfortunately, Creep fails in this area. I see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for Craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation. No character is fully realized, although the circular nature of Kates character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story.In the end, this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty filmmaking that drag down the film.This film will go down as another example of a film as most are that could be so much better even though it would never be great.

These provided some light relief for those expecting a rerun of the TV series.Having said that it passes 90 or so minutes in a fun way and so may just be worth watching.","label":0},{"index":8038,"txt":"To say that Thunderbirds is a horrid, forced, inyourface, ugly looking, nasty to listen to and painful to watch film would not be saying enough. There are only two reasons I can think of why you would watch this film 1; you have seen Thunderbirds when you were young like I did and are curious as to what it is like but you will really only be watching to find out how badly they screwed things up. Or, 2; you are seeing it with someone under ten years old.Thunderbirds manages to cock up everything it attempts. The list goes on and on but there are other more subtle, humiliating things that are painfully obvious when you think about it. From the off, Thunderbirds is wrong, wrong, wrong. The whole moral message and goal is set up in an excruciating way Jeff Tracy A new low for Bill Paxton tells his youngest son Alan he is not yet proved himself to be a Thunderbird after Alan randomly and stupidly decided to go down into Tracy Islands bowels to fire up Thunderbird One. The whole film is then a series of events and missfires consisting of Alan trying to prove himself whilst his father and other brothers are trapped in space aboard Thunderbird five.The film relies on kid actors to carry the film A 16 year old Alan Tracy Corbet, a 16 year old Tin Tin Hudgens and a 14 year old Fermat Fulton who is Brains son. To say that watching the adventures they get up to is painful is an understatement. Frequently trying to act and utilise the script whilst combating the evil Hood Kingsley in ridiculously unfunny and hammy ways acts as the entertainment for the duration of the film; it only differs when everyones in a different location. Also, the whole mind control thing was very tiresome and basically dragged the film down as it was overused and offered a way for our heroes to see a weakness in The Hood \u0096 forced and incidental.I know that most films for kids these days try to integrate some sort of material for adults but in Thunderbirds it is done in a way that fetishises Lady Penelope. Sophia Myles plays Penelope and I think it is no coincidence she is a little older than the rest of the kids \u0096 at 24 years old, it is almost too good to be true. Her scenes are often highly charged and carry an erotic push. We see her in the bath, bubbles up to her neck watching TV; in comes her butler and sneaks a peek as she seductively changes channels with her wet, bare and bubble covered foot. Frequent shots of her massive, bright pink high heeled shoes filling the screen during various scenes This first happens when she is actually tied up with the second happening during a fist fight with another woman! Twinned with this, her bright pink costumes that reveal just enough yet cover just enough are particularly outstanding as is the way she moves and talks with that posh, dominant, English accent; sounding like a commanding mistress Well, she is LADY Penelope after all \u0096 and you would better make sure call her that The whole thing is laughable but the editing is so quick that the kids will not notice but it sure as hell is there.The actual plot of The Hood doing all that he does just to rob a few banks is very bizarre, the characters that are his bodyguards a geeky looking woman and hard bodied black man who gets agitated a lot. Are we supposed to be laughing at this? What about the fight scenes? Poorly choreographed stunts and what the hell was with the silly noises? It is utterly, utterly laughable.The list goes on. The way Bill Paxton plays it all so seriously, like he was told they were doing it one way but it was made another, the way Ford motor company have their logo slapped all over the place. News bulletin sponsored by Ford, the camera even moves to endorse Ford several times when cars are in shot, the way the CGI looks like something out of a computer game video clip \u0096 it is infuriating. The fact we are told to believe that a 16 year old girl can swim in the freezing Thames, against the current, rescue a downed monorail monorail over the Thames!?, get back to the hatch and thus; save the day all the time holding her breath. It is absolute bull and the makers know it \u0096 I do not even know if a 10 year old would swallow it.In short avoid, avoid, avoid.

In the original, the Thunderbirds spent all of their time rescuing people who were often trapped when Mother Nature or Technology went horrible wrong yes, there was also the occasional criminal act. The Thunderbirds put their own lives and resources at risk for no reward  the very essence of heroism and selflessness. There was little physical violence. The Thunderbirds challenged the imagination to a degree  how many of us would dream of someday building a Thunderbird 2? And do not underestimate the power of entertainment to do this  many Japanese attribute their fascination with humanoid robots to the old Astroboy cartoon.But this movie was a poor reimage of the original. This movie came across as a meld between Thunderbirds and Loony Tunes  I mean, we have Anthony Edwards as Brain imitating Porky Pigs stuttering????? Much of the action consists of Kung FuPower Rangers type fighting. Indeed, there were funny sound effects when someone got nailed on the head with a frying pan. The tech that fired our imagination was absent  instead we have these kids running around, using a plot device that was NEVER in the original series having the entire team take off at once, leaving the base occupied by the kids and Brain. Then there was a dose of Use the Force Luke mysticism thrown in when TinTin would levitate something or another, coupled with the The Hood using aerodynamics that looked like they were lifted from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. About the only thing missing was for The Hood to go TinTin, I am your Uncle with a breath mask voice. The heart that made Thunderbirds unique was GONE.The only bright point was Ron Cooks portrayal of Parker  he caught it perfectly. But the actress playing Lady Penelope came across as a child  HUH???? And this is why we hate this movie. When someone puts out something that was popular to a fan base, and expects the fans to shell out money to watch, and then delivers something than was not even close to what the fans expect  well, I am sorry, that is just plain WRONG!

Derek Meddings was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies, and his designs for the International Rescue craft are wonderful. The current team has done a fine job of translating his work to the big screen.BUT...This is one lame story. The kids are asked to drive it, and while they do an okay job, it is hard to suspend your disbelief, especially when you have Brains eightyearold son flying T2, an enormous multiton transport with all the aerodynamics of a Buick. Everywhere you look, you see a Ford logo. Product placement is way over the top here, and it is annoying. Ben Kingsley does an good job as The Hood, but he can only do so much with a onedimensional role. If you can accept the film on its very slim merits, Thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable ride. Just do not look too closely at the machinery that drives it.ADDENDUM I finally got to see all of this, and it is worse than I thought. The acting is fairly uniformly poor, and while the effects are fairly good, the story on multiple viewings has gotten cheesier. The overdone product placement for Ford is annoying, and the kids as central characters grate on my remaining nerves. As with The Avengers, if you ignore the source material, it is bearable. But not very. Watch the original show, and you will see what I mean.And a word of advice to Jon Frakes. Take a refresher course at the Directors Guild. You can do better than this, old friend.Another footnote...I saw this again. Last night. On Telemundo. Dubbed in Spanish, with cheesy comedy sound effects.

I could not wait to see Thunderbird 2 roar in to save people, while Thunderbird 4 would dive deep into the\u0085you get the idea. I just could not wait. Then came August 2004, when the movie was finally released. Critics panned it, but I still wanted to go. After all, as long as the heart was in the same place, that was all that mattered to me. So I sat down in the theater, the only teenager in a crowd of 50\u0085everyone else was over thirty and under ten. Quite possibly the most awkward theater experience that I have ever had\u0085 The movie which is intended to be a prequel focuses on Alan Tracy Brady Corbet, the youngest of the Tracy family. He spends his days wishing that he could be rescuing people like the rest of his family, but he is too young. One day, he finally gets his chance when The Hood Ben Kingsley traps the rest of his family up on Thunderbird 5 the space station. This involves him having to outsmart The Hoods henchmen and rescue his family in time before The Hood can steal all of the money from the Bank of England.Trust me, the plot sounds like a regular episode of Thunderbirds when you read it on paper. Once it gets put on to film\u0085what a mess we have on our hands. First off, the film was intended for children, much like the original show was. However, Gerry Anderson treated us like adults, and gave us plots that were fairly advanced for childrens programming. This on the other hand, dumbs down the plot as it tries to make itself a ripoff of the Spy Kids franchise. The final product is a movie that tries to appeal to fans of the Thunderbirds series and children, while missing both entirely. Lame jokes, cartoonish sounds, and stupid antics that no one really finds amusing are all over this movie, and I am sure that Jonathan Frakes is wishing he would never directed this.Over all, everyone gave a solid performance, considering the script that they were all given. Ben Kingsley was exceptional as The Hood, playing the part extremely well. My only complaint about the characters is about The Hoods henchmen, who are reduced to leftovers from old Looney Tunes cartoons, bumbling about as, amazingly enough, the kids take them on with ease.What is odd about this movie is that while I was watching the movie, I had fun. But once the lights went up, I realized that the movie was fairly bad, I was 8 lighter, and two hours of my time were now gone. A guilty pleasure? Perhaps. Nonetheless, Thunderbirds is a forgettable mess. Instead of a big go, I am going to have to recommend that you stay away from this movie. If the rest of movie could have been like the first ten minutes of it, it would have been an incredible film worthy of the Thunderbirds name.

So, one would deduce the chance to produce a liveaction feature film with a million pound Hollywood budget was an excellent opportunity to revive the series as has been done with SpiderMan and The XMen. But a terrible storyline and bland acting obliterated this opportunity and it was soon apparent all that was destined for this film was a trip to the bargain bin of the kiddies section.Instead of a film focusing on the five Tracey sons, their father and trusty geek Brain striving to rescue people and protect the world from villains, our hero in this drudge is a malcontent and bratty thirteenyearold Alan Tracey, fourteenyearold Tintin and tenyearold brainbox Fermat, son of Brains yes, Brains son despite this being a man who could surely never score a woman if he tried; maybe he grew the kid in a petri dish. As one can tell from a runthrough of our three lead characters, this 2004 remake Thunderbirds was clearly aimed at entertaining only children under twelve instead of trying to appeal to a broad agerange as those involved in the much superior revival of SpiderMan did. The plot itself was so bland with clunky, awkward dialogue and weak jokes that probably would not amuse brighter preteens. The scriptwriter seemed more interested in ripping off Spy Kids which was at least quirky and original instead of remaking the show people know and love.Although Sophia Myles and Ron Cook were excellent as Miss Penelope and Parker, they only had about three lines between them so their presence was barely felt. Bill Paxtons Jeff Tracey was just boring and there was only the slightest of mention of the other four Tracey boys while Anthony Edwards and Ben Kingsley, as Brains and the Hood respectively, were just embarrassing. The Hood, in particular, is not at all threatening or sinister and instead comes across as a campy, twobit stereotypical villain as limp as a piece of rotting lettuce.Brady Corbet, who plays Alan Tracey, may well be a good young actor but it was hard to see that in a film where he plays a whinging brat who just grates and the same goes for Vanessa Anne Hutchinson as Tintin since the most she gets to do is look pretty and be all for Girl Power. Ironically, it is young Soren Fultons Fermat who is the only interesting character of the film as Fulton delivers a natural and relaxed performance.Thunderbirds the series will be forever remembered as an excellent show that proves puppets can give solid performances! Thunderbirds the film will be forgotten by most and remembered by a few as one big flop.","label":0},{"index":8051,"txt":"The basic formula for the original series was; take someone, get the audience to like them, then put them into Mortal danger. This formula worked for the 32 episodes made between 196468. Now, we jump forward 40 years to 2004.. We are introduced to Alan Tracy, a somewhat lessthandiligent college school kid, with his friend, Fermat, a young knowitall. They are whisked off by Lady Penelope in her pink Ford Thunderbird to the island paradise where the Tracy Family live, for the school holidays. Almost immediately, they are left in the care of Kyrano and his daughter, TinTin whilst the adults go to rescue John from Thunderbird 5 which has been damaged by a staged accident. This is all part of The Hoods scheme to take over Tracy Island so that he can steal the Thunderbird machines ...\u0085To rob a bank!Yes. The plot IS as limp as that!The dialogue is banal, the acting more wooden than that of the fibreglass puppets, the effects, anything but special and Hans Zimmers score\u0085? What little there was of Barry Grays glorious theme shone through Zimmers lackluster orchestration. The rest of the score was eminently forgettable. In fact, part of the score was broadcast the following week on the radio and did not recognise it! I did not even bother to stay to witness Busteds mediocre efforts with the end titlesTo be fair, Ron Cook worked quite well as Parker, he and Sophia Myles as Penelope seemed wasted. With the right material, they could have been show stoppers. The CGI work was what I would have called leading edge  5 years ago.The Dynamics of the main craft were just wrong; The original series models at least moved as if they had massAnother sore point is that the whole production seemed to be one long set of product placements, from every vehicle being built by Ford to the entire content of the Tracy Freezer being produced by Ben  Jerrys.My son 9 enjoyed the film but this cross between Spy Kids and Clockstoppers, aimed squarely at his age group, added nothing to the Thunderbirds legend. When Star Trek hit the big screen in 1979 with The Motion Picture, a whole new lease of life was breathed into the franchise which then continued for another 20 years or so. With this film, Frakes has missed a golden opportunity to do the same with the Thunderbirds franchise.I predict that this film, like The Avengers and the Saint before it, will sink into obscurity within 6 months, leaving the original series to its classic status.","label":0},{"index":8052,"txt":"I have always thought that most huge boxoffice flops usually have something to recommend them, but after the remake of Around the World in 80 Days and Thunderbirds, I am beginning to doubt it. For those not familiar, it is based on a puppet show about a family of astronauts who use state of the art rockets, spaceships and subs to rescue people from various disasters falling bridges, stricken planes, burning buildings, etc each week. Well, the puppets are gone replaced by far more lifeless teenagers, and so is the premise  only one ineptly staged rescue and a plot shamelessly ripped off from Spy Kids without any signs of imagination, wit or entertainment. Young Alan Tracey feels left out of all the rescuing we never see the other Traceys do because dad will not let him play with a real rocket until he passes his exams. Grounded on a beautiful tropical island some punishment!, his chance to shine comes when the rest of the family  a bunch of identikit bleachblondes who look like a gay neoNazi boy band without a single bit of characterisation between them  are stranded in space and he has to have the day by, er, running around the jungle, making a phone call, firing a hose at the inept comedy relief villains and dousing them in gunk for bad measure.The good points are few and far between. One of them is that the film is mostly in focus. The other is they all got to go to the Seychelles, which looks nice.The bad points where to start? Ben Kingsleys career lowpoint performance? The aforementioned inept comedy relief sidekicks who would disgrace the Childrens Film Foundation at its worst? The almost complete lack of action or effects in a 70m scifi film? The terrible script, the lifeless direction, the odious moralising? But most of all is the fact that the film is so patronising in every possible way. Forget the life lessons and off the peg sentiment, this is a movie aimed straight at the undereights by people who know they are making a kids movie and are constantly talking down to their intended audience, throwing in fifthrate jokes and routines that would insult most children who had only recently mastered the art of speech. This film could replace being sent to bed early without their dinner as parents favourite punishment for kids.The biggest flop in British film history it did not even cover the cost of prints and marketing, it is just about watchable if only as an object lesson in how NOT to make a summer movie.","label":0},{"index":8053,"txt":"Okay I must say that before the revealing of the monster. saying that he really did not fit into that category, just some weird thing that had an annoying screech! And personally I think a granny could have ran away from that thing, but anyway. I actually was getting into this film, although having the main character a drunk and a heroine addict did not come as an appeal. But such scenes as when she runs away from the train, and you can see the figure at the door was kind of creepy, also where the guard had just been killed and the monster put his hand on the screen.But then disaster stuck form the moment the monster was revealed it just became your average horror, with limited thrills or scares. Slowly I became more bored, and wanted to shut the thing off. I like most people have said was rooting for the homeless people to make it, specially the guy, he gave me a few cheap laughs here and there. I think this film could have really been something special instead it became what every other horror nowadays are!

But, he really should not have directed this movie, and the screenplay should have been rejected. The director and writers must understand what the original TV show was really about, as well as who the characters were and how they worked. The original series had many episodes with razorsharp writing using good dialogue and with situations that American producers would never consider using in childrens programming, much less a movie, which made the original series so well received by adults. I mean, the Tracys were college graduates and some of them did even drank alcohol and smoked tobacco! And, there were characters who did get killed, although most were bad guys. If they had written it the way that it was originally done, which is not dumbing things down with poor dialogue, kindergarten humor, and a weak plot, this UniversalStudio Canal joint venture would not have such bad reviews. This motion picture is almost pure blasphemy. If you have seen the original Supermarionation series, then you will know what I am talking about! The first thing that was out of place and annoying were the constant references to Ford Motor Company, even going so far that Lady Penelope was riding around in a disfigured Ford Thunderbird made up to look like FAB1 instead of using what would have been more appropriate considering Ms. Penelopes station not to mention being more faithful to the original, a ROLLSROYCE FAB1. She is supposed to be a distinguished member of British society, hence the preference for Englands finest make of motorcars in the original series. One other reviewer here indicated that Penelope would not be caught dead in a Ford. He is pretty much right in the context that the idea of her riding in a Ford does not work. At least they could have had Penelope ride in a Jaguar made up like FAB 1 since Jaguar is a British car make that is owned by Ford, but NO! They had to use a straight FORD! But the Ford product placement does not end there. EVERY single car you may see is a Ford! Even the news flash that is shown on the TV sets in the movie were sponsored by Ford! Ford, Ford, FORD! The predominance of Ford vehicles makes this movie an obvious marketing vehicle for Ford. The original series had a design that was futuristic for the 1960s and still remains ahead of its time even today. But, the futuristic design in the original series worked because there was an effort to make the design look practical and functional. This kind of treatment did not exist in the movie, where everything is stylized to excess, defeating the sense of functionality and practicality. A lot of things that were done in the design of the movie were done strictly for style, many times with no sense of function to give that style a sense of reason.The original series relied on good acting performances of the voice talent to overcome the limited expressions in the puppets, bringing them to life in the episodes. The brilliant and lively music score by Barry Gray helped even further to connect the audience with the story, the characters, and how everything came together to help achieve the super objective a little bit of Stanislavski talk. The movie, on the other hand, had some overly grating performances. Anthony Edwards overplayed Brains to a fault, Bill Paxton as Jeff Tracy just did not work despite decent acting one of few, there were better choices for the Hood than Ben Kingsley, and many others that I do not care to mention it would take too long. Quite simply, the puppets were more believable! Second was the overly generic and underwhelming music score by Hans Zimmer, sounding more like a mix between Days of Thunder and Apollo 13. And, of course, the Hood. The Hood in the original series had an ability to communicate with Kyrano through a statue of Kyrano as an outlet for ESP contact. But, that was where his extraordinary capability ended. He is a master of disguise and deception, which allows him to sneak around undetected for the most part, anyways to gather information of the Thunderbirds vehicles for his own means. He also uses weapons for his own defense, including pistols, and generally collects information using a film camera, although he tried to steal Thudnerbirds 1 and 2 in the 1960s United Artists release of Thunderbird 6 which was the last Thunderbirds show filmed in Supermarionation and was the second Thunderbirds theatrical release. But, while he is a nemesis of International Rescue, the Hood is not the villain in every Thunderbirds episode and he tends to avoid direct confrontation with International Rescue. In the movie, he is obviously the main villain, but he and his cohorts seem to act more like morons, along with the Hood having extended mind control ability, including the ability to move objects and move himself into flight for brief periods of time. This totally deviates from the Hood as a character in the original series with one that may leave kids laughing and people familiar with the series scratching their heads in confusion or leaving the theater in disgust.There are more criticisms, but the 1000 word limit for IMDb reviews will not allow me to list all of them. So, I will close with the point being made that I did not enjoy this movie. As a matter of fact, I think it sucks! Having seen the original series and Supermarionation movies Thunderbirds Are Go, Thunderbird 6, I was hoping for something a lot better than this.The original Supermarionation was a lot more sophisticated and elegant than this live action farce.

Undeniably good writing and interesting story. However, I did not have very high expectations for the movie. There was no way mainstream Hollywood would have taken up a Christian series and produced a bigbudget movie. So it was done independently... and it just felt like I was watching a really long TV show. It just did not FEEL like a movie; it did not have that movie experience to it, if anybody knows what I am talking about. So the movie suffered because of that, and the lowbudget, poor special effects were another detraction for me.On top of that, I feel that Gordon Currie was woefully miscast as Nicolie Carpathia. Reading the book, my impression of NC was that he was supposed to be this charming, dazzling, amazingly handsome guy who spoke English with almost zero trace of an accent. So I imagined somebody like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found some Clay Aiken pencilneck who looks like an employee of the month from Best Buy, and gave him a really bad fake accent.

I am not a religious, so I could not care less really but filmmaking does some like a good tool to reach a new audience for churches and getting people more interested and curious in reading the bible for instance. In that regard these movies always seem like a wasted opportunity.The low budget does really hurt the movie and brings it down. It makes the movie laughable to watch with its effects and it just gives the overall movie a campy Bmovie like feeling.But what is hurting this movie more is its writing. The stuff that just happens in this movie is just insulting to the intelligence and then I am not even complaining or talking about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the movie progresses is just so improbable and the people within this movie do such highly unlikely things that it is being insulting to its viewers.I also hated how the movie was being like a soap opera at times. Seemed to me that they simply had a hard time turning this into a full length movie and they added in some characters and dramatic developments just to fill things up.

While the books do manage to remain faithful to scripture, their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous an example is their explanation for the RussianArab invasion of Israel. Also, the books have an unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them to the gospel. Still, I found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of Revelation. For a similar reason, I watched this film adaptation. I am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film bordering on poor. The acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and overacting. The script is rather bad, though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis. The characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped. Events feel scattered and disconnected. The dialogue sometimes sounds rushed. At least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory. Here, the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book. The pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed, and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow trudge that makes it feel padded. The music is schizophrenic. At times, it successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture. At other moments, it reminds me of sitcom and miniseries music. And still other bits remind me of a poppy MTV soundtrack that just does not belong in the film. I can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane, but that is it. The other scenes involving the disasters after the Rapture are far from compelling. The film also suffers from the books preachiness although its message is not quite as in your face. In all, I found the movie just as disappointing as the series. This is not the film to rally Christians around it. I hope that this film does NOT get any attention at the theaters next year. It would be more unnecessary bad publicity for Christianity. For an example of a compelling, intelligent, wellresearched series based on Revelation that presents a realistic and Christian world view without offending the secular reader who after all should be whom a Christian is trying to reach read the Christ Clone trilogy by James BeauSeigneur.

He probably meant VERSE 24, but the film makers missed this slip up. Perhaps the worst part is that the films eschatological position is Biblically unsound. While many Christians have espoused the films interpretation of endtime events, such interpretation, in my opinion, is faulty.

While I realize there is a 3rd movie out that I have not seen yet, I will review under the original title...Just from the standpoint of production value, screen writing, and movie making, this movie fails on many levels, though it succeeds on a few as well. What can you expect from a lowbudget, B movie? Not much, and it works from the standpoint of production. However, the writing is certainly disjointed, with little in the way of character development...exactly what I would expect when there is an agenda to a film. I did not have a problem with the acting...the cast is solid; however, the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves. Because the film is Christian, this is predictable, as you cannot very well portray violent chaos of the end times without also breaking some of the ethics which are normally associated with Christianity. In other words, the mistake comes in making this into a Grated film when the content, even in the most conservative of Bible interpretations, would be Rrated by any measure. So, if the purpose of the movie is to scare people into Christian faith, then the movie should be somewhat scary, right? However, you cannot comment on a film adaptation from a book without commenting on the book, or in this case, series of books. There are certainly plenty of Christian materials worthy enough to be made into movies...but not the Left Behind series...and these movies ultimately fail because, while being bestsellers, they are poorly written novels based on bad theology.As a Southern Baptist minister, I confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me, though I have yet to finish the last two books of the series. I have described them as decent fiction, and if the books would take the point of view that this is one possibility or interpretation of the subject of biblical eschatology study of the end times, then I could live with that. However, this series is divisive in Christian circles because it promotes the literalist interpretation of all Scripture above a more proper hermeneutic. Inevitably, this leads to the pretrib, premillenial dispensation point of view, which confines an allpowerful God far too by humanitys world. In other words, as I have always said, God should not need our helicopters and bombs to do his ultimate work. But because many people, particularly unstudied Christians, cannot think beyond their own worldviews, we are left with a proconservative, fundamentalist stance with regard to Bible interpretation, and attempts to push it through as the only interpretation.Thus, the books carry with them an agenda, not so much to get the lost to understand their need for Christ, but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way to understand the Bible. I recall very clearly reading several years ago in the second novel a scene where the characters reference a person who was left behind BECAUSE of his nonadherence to this point of view; as if real christians worthy to be raptured could not possibly hold to another eschatology. This is disturbing for several reasons, the least of which is because a rapture is only briefly mentioned in Scripture and it is connection to real, endtime prophecy is tenuous at best.But the real issue with these books is comes in the way they divide the Christian community and how they portray true Christian behavior. Ultimately, I feel they harden more people to an otherwise legitimate faithreligion instead of win people towards it. It turns all Christians into caricatures, equally disdained and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is theological room for a wide diversity of believes within Christian thought and practice. As a Christian body, on the whole, we have done enough of that kind of damage to society over 2000 years of history...and we certainly do not need to promote it by film to thousands, maybe millions of others.Thus, the Left Behind movies fail because the Left Behind books are not worthy to be interpreted into movies.","label":0},{"index":8091,"txt":"I am a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind. That being said, I think Left Behind is one of the worst films I have seen in some time.To have a good movie, you need to have a wellwritten screenplay. Left Behind fell woefully short on this. For one thing, it radically deviates from the book. Sometimes this is done to condense a 400page novel down to a twohour film, but in this film I saw changes that made no sense whatsoever.Another thing, there is zero character development. When characters in the story get saved I will not say who, the book makes it clear that it is a long, soulsearching process. In the film it is quick and artificial. The book is written decently enough where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real, but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial. In another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind again, I will not say who, it seems artificial.I realize as a Christian it is unedifying for me to say I disliked this film, but I cannot in a good conscience recommend a film that I feel was horribly done. Perhaps it would have been better to make the first book into 23 films. Either way, Christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers, we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way.

Unfortuntaely the killer Lumberjack dude show is up with his axe  starts to slaughter the friends onebyone...Edited, written, executive produced  directed by Todd Portugal this is a pretty rotten modern slasher flick the likes of which are killing the horror genre for me, I am just not a big fan of ultra low budget horror films with the production values of a holiday video. The script is absolutely terrible in every way for 80 minutes, it has every bad slasher clich\u00e9, the characters are awful, the dialogue is terrible  it is hard to care about anyone or anything in this pretty worthless excuse for a teen slasher film. The teens are even more annoying  stupid than usual, the script is more moronic, predictable  flawed than usual  the killer Lumberjack dude is just lame. Then there is the final 10 minutes or so which, if you make it that far  believe it is tough going, produces one of the worst twist ending in slasher film history which as far as I am concerned pokes fun at us the paying audience who has just had to sit through 90 minutes worth of crap. I will now spoil the ending so anyone who does not want to know it stop reading now. Basically just before the end of the film it cuts back to Ray telling a story  it turns out he was telling the story of what we had just seen  Nick  Dawn  everyone else berates him for telling such a bad story I felt their pain  then proceed to pick holes in it  laugh at it.

Then to add insult to injury the Lumberjack dude turns up  kills everyone within two minutes, why did not he do that to start with? It would have saved everyone a lot of time.Director Portugal turns in a real mess, this has the worst continuity between night  day in a film I have ever seen. The whole film is meant to set at night  I suspect the makers tried to use the day for night process but it did not work  most of it looks like it is set during the day. For example, look at when Lisa is trapped in the bathroom  she climbs out of the window. It is clearly pitch black outside when we are looking out from inside the bathroom but when she falls to the ground  the films cuts to an exterior shot it is bright daylight. Then there is the fact Ranger Vince says we cannot get a search party out here until the morning indicating it was supposed to be night, then several minutes later when he walks outside  it looks like it is the middle of the day he is actually carrying around a torch which is clearly on  he is clearly pointing it in the directions where he is looking like it is night. Anytime there is a scene set in the cabin look at the windows, it is pitch black outside  when the Ranger walks in through the door to start with is also another clear example. The continuity in this film is simply the worst I have ever seen. There is not much gore, there are a few scenes of an axe going into people bodies but nothing memorable. It is not scary, there is no tension or atmosphere  the appalling day  night continuity is just so distracting because it is so obvious.Technically the film is rock bottom, again the continuity between night  day has to been seen to be believed how bad it is. The special effects are poor  they could not even afford to show a car blowing up even though it is pretty vital to the plot. This has amateur hour written all over it from start to finish. The acting is absolutely brilliant  everyone involved should get an Oscar, nah only joking, not really they were utterly awful  even the girls who got their breasts out were not very good looking.The Legend of Bloody Jack is just an awful teen slasher flick, it looks like it was shot on a camcorder without the use of a tripod or steadycam, it has awful effects, is boring  has a twist ending which is either the most insulting in horror film history or I have got it totally wrong  it is the most clever. Not recommended, watch a decent slasher from the 70s or 80s to remind you how they should be done.","label":0},{"index":8099,"txt":"Absolutely laughable film. I live in London and the plot is so illresearched it is ridiculous. No one could be terrorised on the London Underground. In the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs, etc. That there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely. Or that it is even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and age...The worst that is likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them. Although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network, another thorn in the side of the story. Remember in London as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.If it had been set in a city I am not familiar with perhaps I could have enjoyed it through ignorance, but it is not a high quality film so I just could not bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it is.I would have given it 010 if such a rating existed!

That is not a compliment. It is not the narcotic effect of a truly hypnotic or thought provoking movie. The feelings it stirs up combine like some uncomfortable emotional Voltron, composed of a confusing mix of some form of rage, the vague desire to take a shower, the rudderless, sinking feeling of true betrayal one gets when they realize they have given 109 minutes of their lives into the hands of someone who would not only squander it, but do so in such a pompous, artless way. And I probably would not have done anything super productive with that 109 minutes anyway! But even if I would spent it on something trivial, like a power block of masturbation and online poker, I would have felt more fulfilled when all was said and done.The problems with this movie are myriad, and in better times I would articulate exactly what they were in a semiadult fashion. But in keeping with what this movie deserves, I think I will most likely stick to the realm of masturbation jokes and cartoon references.The most irritating and terminal flaw is that while watching this movie one is keenly aware that the makers and participants think they are making a much smarter movie than they are. Demonstrating the depth of knowledge one could pick up in a one semester survey of Western art history at a community college or trade school, the artjargon is piled on thick and from all directions, with much of it supplied by talk between our hero, the tortured detective Stan Willem Dafoe, who I will forgive for this movie due to him being Willem Dafoe and his accented antique dealer buddy Blair Peter Stormare, taking a break from playing a sociopath for whom murder comes easy by playing a 2dimensional plot device in a movie about a sociopath for whom murder comes easy. And talk they do. In fact, we are dropped into this story at a crime scene that may indicate the reemergence of a serial killer Stan thinks he killed years earlier, so all the back story is established partially through unclear flashback, but primarily through stilted conversations between Stan and his dealer, or Stan and his colleague, the unforgivably irritating Carl Scott Speedman. And although I differentiate the character Carl Scott Speedman from the actor who plays him by using parentheses, I must admit that very early on in the film I despised this character so much that I actually found myself sincerely wishing harm on the actor portraying him Scott Speedman. Not anything too fancy. Not death or paralysis, necessarily.. But maybe herpes? Or maybe a stage light could fall on him and crush his arm? This is a dangerous digression, but I am not editing it out because I want to leave anyone reading this who is thinking about paying to see this train wreck of a movie with a clear impression of the horrible wishes and feelings it stirs in even the most peaceful man.Well, I am sort of running out of steam here.. over the course of writing this the sick feelings this movie brought up in a me have subsided, my head has cleared a bit. Realizing now that I am still investing time in something related to this piece of sh!t is startlingly similar to waking up after a night of suicidally heavy drinking next to the heaving form of a still slumbering 200 pound college girl.

The sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic detail are not cohesively drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives, finally at the end.

Scott Speedman is Dafoes junior partner and they have pretty good chemistry at least for a while. Other characters pop up to conveniently tie the two cases together. Clea Duval is the friend of an earlier victim and Peter Stormare is some sort of art brokermentor to Dafoe...that is a bit hard to take, although Stormare is, of course, never dull.

Willem Dafoe gives a credible performance as the investigator, but he has little to do with a script that is stretched to the limit.

In this catastrophe directed by Frankenheimer who also brought us such gems as Raindeer Games and the Island of Dr. Moreau the movie focuses on Doyle and his singular obsession of capturing Charnier Rey. The fictitious idea that the NYPD would allow Doyle to travel to Marseilles to find Charnier with the help of the French local authorities is laugh out loud funny. Correct me if I am wrong, but did not Charnier skip town with 65 pounds of pure smack!!! A street value of 32 million but yeah, let us send Doyle to find this guy, it was his pinch after all. Please!!! The story was weak. The acting was terrible with the lone exception of Hackman, who completely overplayed his part. The direction was all over the place. Even the cuts between scenes were terrible. Do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one.","label":0},{"index":8108,"txt":"Even duller, if possible, than the original I hope I may say that under the IMDb guidelines. THE FRENCH CONNECTION at least tried to absorb European influences, to complicate the conventional view of the American police detective, even if the attempt was foundered by Friedkins ambivalence, Americaness and general indirection. The relative arthouse boom of the 1960s especially with the nouvelle vague allowed for a huge influence of European cinema in Hollywood. This lent a new vigour and complexity to a weary medium, and, in the best of them eg BONNIE AND CLYDE, early Scorcese, a new subversion of received practice. The original CONNECTION was part of this movement, with its difficultly distanced style, and antidetective figure. TWO is old Hollywoods rightwing reassertion of American values.This is figured in the films very tiresome America vs France dialectic. For instance, TWO is shot like a 70s French policier. It was the French, of course, who insisted on the greatness of American movies when they were ignored at home, and this, in a sense, is a reclamation, a warning against Gallic presumption. This can be seen in the pattern of the two movies. CONNECTION has French gangsters invading New York, with the French style smothering the American thriller  this leads to the dissolution of the detective figure, and irresolution of plot  the baddie got away. TWO has the American returning to France, with American thriller values imposed on the native genre  the power of the detective is reasserted and conventional resolution is achieved. This is further dramatised in Doyles relationship with French inspector Barthelmy, whose dominant influence he must shake off before he can control the plot.TWO seems to follow the original by undermining its detective hero. From the start, Doyles importance is diminished at every turn. Despite the ending of CONNECTION, he is considered a hero. But he is an American in a foreign land, and his inability to control language or customs means he cannot dominate the plot. He even misreads the signs of the police force, mistaking an informer for a criminal, and getting him killed. A detectives power comes from his power as subject to see and interpret, but Doyle spends much of the movie being watched, controlled, an object, a body literally in the scenes after he is dumped by Charnier to be viewed and interpreted. In CONNECTION, he instigated the action, chasing the criminals, forcing the plot; here he is passive, tied to a bed, locked in a cell, an addict, a dependent.This loss of phallic power is predictably symbolised in the loss of his gun, and the film follows a depressingly familiar Oedipal trajectory. In the heroin sequences, he is comforted by an old lady who says he looks like her son. His drugged state is like a return to the womb, robbed of adult pressures. Her taking his watch reinforces the timelessness of this state, doubly significant for a man whose career depends on timetables and precision.Oedipus was the first detective, and to avoid his fate, Doyle must reject this false mother who is dissolving his unified identity, and kill the father Charnier so that he can take his accepted masculine role in society. Psychoanalytic theory was popular among academics in the 70sironically instigated by a Frenchman, Jacques Lacan, but it is rare to see a film so literally full of it. If all of these facts tended towards the minimising of Doyle, then the films style does not. Friedkin distanced us from his hero by refusing empathy or character motivation, focusing on the mechanics of plot. Here, Doyle is a very conventional Hollywood hero. Instead of being lost in murky long shot, he is made knowable and understandable to the viewer with the traditional devices  pointofview shots, close ups, connecting shots etc.TWO is all about the fall and rise of Popeye Doyle. Plot in this case is subservient to the acting, which is the usual Hackman showiness. The cold turkey scenes, therefore, despite their tediousness, are not disturbing. We are allowed to share rather than coldly observe; this a far less discomforting experience. The scenes are also shot through with a lachrymose manly sentimentality that is very American. So while CONNECTION tried to imitate the complex thrillers of Jean Pierre Melville, TWO does the complete opposite. Melvilles LE SAMOURAI featured a gangster who started the film whole, powerful, outside language, and charted his eventual disintegration. TWO starts with a disintegrated character, achieved partly through inability with language, whose dominance begins when he steps outside language  the concluding action sequences are largely wordless. In the film, the locale and language are important as they fixed and undermined the detective, but as he regains his power figured in the return of his gun, and the cathartic burning of the primal site of vulnerability, the tower block where Charnier held him, the Marseilles setting becomes more irrelevant, and the mythic standoff, which could take place anywhere, takes over. Compare the endings of the two films one admits ambiguity and despair, the other absolute certainty.","label":0},{"index":8109,"txt":"First off, anyone who thinks this sequel to William Friedkins The French Connection, is superior is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both. The problem with reviewing this film is that, a. it is a sequel to a brilliant movie, which always makes watching it objectively difficult, and b. it is directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors ever, so I wanted to like it. William Friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film about drug traffic in decaying new York city, because of his documentarylike approach to the action and story, Frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish directors ever, i.e. The Manchurian Candidate and Seconds, and with his French Connection 2 it feels like someone trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off. That fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel by Gene Hackman himself really tells a lot about Hackmans understanding about the original film too. It is well known Hackman hated Friedkin on the set and vowed to never work with him again, it is also known he envisioned the character to be more one dimensional, loosing weight and trying to play him like a straight character. it shows you Hackman, despite being a great actor, had no idea who to make the movie and the story great. The plot point of Doyle becoming an addict is interesting, but does not warrant the rest of the film.

Last season episode 13 was pulled due to the way it handled the abortion issue. I think that this season Mr Carpenter managed to make something so greyarea that you cannot immediately see if he is prochoice or antiabortion. It was only after I sat and thought about it that I realized he is very much antiabortion you get this most clearly in the end when the Mother shoots the baby and kills it, to the dismay of the Father, who walks off in grief, leaving the mother unharmed. But you also see it in the way the Ron P. character is treated I hardly think that if someone has proved themselves enough of a threat in the past so as to have a restraining order against him that they would not immediately be ringing the police. Instead we have the guard almost sympathetically dealing with him only to pay for it in the end I do not mind someone having a strong view on something, even if it is not something I agree in, but I do think its a bit lame not to stand by that view, rather than trying to look like they are sitting somewhere in the middle.But, political issues aside, this episode was beyond poor.

Angeliques father, Dwayne Ron Perlman, is a stonecold, farright holy roller who will do anything to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion. If for nothing else, ProLife accumulated some buzz for its controversial issue, but John Carpenter treats this whole venture with startling indifferencehe seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself which is admittedly poor; the slow pacing builds no tension, and simply brings the already ambling plot to a crawl. Even when Dwayne and his sons storm the clinic, guns blazing, it is a stunning nonevent; later, when a doctor is tortured with a male abortion, the scene comes off as gratuitous and unnecessaryan effort to pad out the underwritten film. The poor performances Perlman is sadly wasted here become an outgrowth of the script, and Carpenters direction feels exhausted, as if ProLife is the source of his next hot meal. By the time a spidercreature with a human head and a guy in a latex monster suit are prowling the hallways, you just have to wonder what the minds behind this mess were thinking...","label":0},{"index":8126,"txt":"Well well well. As good as John Carpenters season 1 outing in Masters of Horror was, this is the complete opposite. He certainly proved he was still a master of horror with Cigarette Burns but ProLife is perhaps the worst I have seen from him.It is stupid, totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it overstays it is welcome, despite the lessthananhour running time. The script is nonsense, the characters are irritable and unappealing and the conclusion is beyond absurd.And for those suckers who actually bought the DVD one of them being me; did you see how Carpenter describes the film? He is actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time, and he praises the script. And in the commentary track, where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut, he just says he did not feel it essential to rectify the mistake and he just let it be there. I fear the old master has completely lost his touch. I sincerely hope I am proved wrong.I want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome, though. Technically speaking, this film is top notch, with effective lighting schemes and make up effects.","label":0},{"index":8127,"txt":"I went into a Video Store and looked around to find some Horror Movies, after about 30 minutes I just rushed and picked out a few. I stumbled upon Masters of Horror which contained ProLife and Right to Die. They seemed OK, sameold cheesy Horror crap, but I was interested for some reason. It said about ProLife on the case about being a classic, a return to form for John Carpenter I loved his The Thing, so I thought this would be good and all that. So I turned it on thinking it would be something great and interesting, I was very wrong... It started off casual, just a girl running through a Forest, scared of something. A car stops and picks her up just so being the people she needed to see, amazing? They take her back to some Clinic and examine her, at the sametime all this is happening her Father appears at the gates and they do not allow him in, he is not aloud near the area. Most likely from something he would of done in the past, but you do not know of any of this at the moment. He really does not want his Daughter in this place, an Abortion center. He is very strongly against such acts, believing it is sickening and not what God would want. He supports what I heard is called ProLife. Acting against Abortions and going to extremes to allow the Babies to be born, they are sick. They do not like the Life of an unborn being taken, yet they have killed Humans in the past to allow the Birth? Justice is only a figment of the mind. Anyway, back on track, after the girl is examined they find out shes pregnant, but far ahead than what she should be. She is only a few weeks pregnant, but is months ahead. She keeps telling them they wont understand her, and that she wants an Abortion and all, but finally tells the truth that she was raped by a Demon from Hell, and that her Father wants this baby but believes God wants this baby, not who truly does. He gets his 3 Sons they arm themselves with Pistols and Shotguns, and begin to make they are way into the Clinic shooting down anyone who will not cooperate. The head of the Clinic, who must of had trouble with them in the past, is well prepared this time. Ends up killing one the Fathers Sons, but in the end gets shot a few times wearing a bullet proof jacket. The Father then performs what he believes is done to the Women. He cuts a hole, where the Vagina would be if he we are a Female, and sticks some sort of sucking thing up there and sucks out all this blood. Whilst all this is happening, the girl gives birth to some Demonic baby with many legs, and some Demon raises from beneath the Earth not in the same room and starts looking for its child. The Father sees this later on, and starts questioning why this happened, he did what he was told to do, and does not understand why it is like this. The Demon had killed both of his Sons earlier, and now goes for Father... Whilst the girl kills the baby, and the Demon carries it away not in the same scene.Yeah, it probably sounds pretty cool, and a thrilling Horror Movie, but it is not. The acting is horrible and lacks enthusiasm, the script is boring and not even creative, they choose the wrong characters and do not even build on them; just everything put together, all the small parts, do not even add up to something great, a waste of time. I would not classify this as a Horror, though it has elements of Horror, they ultimately fail at what they try to succeed. It felt more like a Beginners ShortMovie, than by John Carpenter.Sorry for my lack of information, and detailed review, I just did not have the time to waste to write something exciting. Also sorry if my spelling and details are incorrect, I could not really be bothered to research anything.","label":0},{"index":8128,"txt":"I was looking forward to seeing John Carpenters episode in Season 2 because his first, Cigarette Burns, was by far the best from Season 1 and I did like other episodes from that season. Oh, how I was disappointed.In fairness to Carpenter I think the primary problem with this episode was absolutely horrible writing. The characters, aside from the subject matter, seemed to behave and speak as though they were written for an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger. The acting was bad, and I normally like Ron Perlman a lot, but I can only blame them so much because the writing was so horrible. I am not going to try to guess what the writers were trying to do because that would be useless but it appeared as though they were trying to mix horror obviously with some form of social commentary on abortion and religion. In this case, not surprisingly, it seemed a chance to bash a certain variety or religious nuts as well as fanatical antiabortionists. And I am in favor of both aims but it was done so horribly that I was embarrassed to watch characters act and speak with such stupid inconsistency. This failed totally to offer any worthwhile opinion on the subjects and the horror element failed as well alongside such inept writing.While I do not think Carpenter can be blamed for most of the badness here I will say he did choose to direct the teleplay and therefore has that to be held responsible for. There are a couple small bits that I found nice, hence the 2 stars I gave it.The actual gore and monster effects were good, but the CGI gore two separate gunshots to the head were so obviously inferior quality CGI they should have never been given the OK. I am generally very critical of CGI but not because I have a problem with it in principle. I have a problem with the execution of it. The technology, while amazing in some respects, is not good enough to match real effects, whether they be miniatures or gore especially when it is supposed to match something organic andor alive, and therefore should not be used until they are. CGI can be used well in small amounts or obviously if the whole film is animated.I will also take this opportunity to note that the show title, Masters of Horror, is a bad title to have. There simply are not many actual masters of horror around. Maybe two or three. If the show were called Tale of Horror or something like that it would be fine. But as it stands the criteria for directing one of these episodes, and therefore being criticized for not being a master of horror is that they have directly at least one horror film in their career. And it did not even have to be a good one.","label":0},{"index":8129,"txt":"SLIGHT SPOILERS but it does not matter anyway.An exercise in gobblygook of catastrophic proportions not even worthy of the l0 lines I need to put these remarks on the netwaves. This is the single worst episode of the Masters series to date and the first that qualifies for the defunct Mystery Science Theatre treatment. Even if it took me a full half hour to realize the intended ironic angle, it was still a very lame mess. Its sole value lies in the perspective that forces one to realize that in addition to gore and ugly masks the genre only succeeds when the classic cinematic notions of photography and lighting, dialogue and acting, editing and timing are put to use. Here they are absent and John Carpenter is no master. Period. And no trite analysis of the easy social comment herein will change that. Oddly, Carpenter never has been anything more than a B director, but at least such films as Fog and The Thing had terrific atmosphere the latter is one of my cult favorites.Abominable acting. Camera angles stuck in cement. Tensionless rhythm. Yet perhaps the single most obnoxious element of the episode is the storyline which of course JC cannot really be blamed for unless the writers were buddies of Cody. The initial two minute slomo of a girl running through a forest only to be nearly run over by a would be ScullyMulder duo is the first and last thing that works in the film. But come on, a girl hurtling through a deserted woods to nowhere in particular in desperate need of an abortion fortuitously rendezvous with the fender of a pair of womens rights MDs whose clinic just happens to be at the end of the road around the corner. Oh, and I will not even nitpick about how the doc whips the accidentee into the car and speeds away at 0 to 60 in six seconds. Does wonders for possible broken ribs or concussion.Then things fall apart real quick. The vacuous dialogue I just want to help you, the interminably sluggish back and forth at the gate, grandiose battle tactics like cutting the telephone line in the age of cell phones? followed by the the shootout a bornagain Ramboesque clinic director vs Ron Perlman and the high school bullpen out for a few kicks at Easter break. Another lovely line So what are we going to do? from the kid who had just been sitting on a pile of assault rifles in the back of the van. Er, no it is not yet pheasant season. So who needs those teen boys anyway. What about the good old tried and true method of the lone lunatic who bashes his way through the gate with his allAmerican SUV?As for the exchange of bullets scenes themselves, the cuts here were as stiff as the staccato of a DC comics strip. All that was lacking were the Wham, Bam, and Whiz of the balloon titles. And all to the tune of a soundtrack worthy of an old Mannix episode.At one point we learn that Daddy is not really the daddy, but at this point we have not been led to care much any more either. This storys single source of drama is the conflict between the prolife father and his pregnant daughter who is only thankful she is not having twins. Yet there is not a single scene, flashback or not, where they are actually ever found together. They remain mere abstractions to each other throughout.With the exception of the gatekeeper every single one of the characters is absolutely dislikeable. Bland, hysterical, dullheaded, macho. As perfectly flat as human wallpaper can be. None of the doctors seem to have anything medical about them. And there is that bickering Dad who rails at his pregnant daughter as though he himself were the stressed out boyfriend. He fortunately got his. There are two great MSTworthy comic moments the gusher when Angelicas plumbing goes out and later the newborn lobster with a glued on babys head. Also cute was Angelicas rugby ball belly before she finally popped the righttolife little monster from Hell. As for that audacious male abortion scene...well, they should have retained Miikes episode and banned this one instead.In short, a 3rd rate Rosemarys Baby meets Alien set on the turf of a M.A.S.H. episode. This stinker alone, appreciable only to todays permissive under16 generation, will assure as someone else said here, that this series will not be renewed for a third season. A real shame, since there have been a number of brilliant productions, including such really decent spoofs as Dantes Homecoming or McKees deliciously quirky Sick Girl. Not to mention the superb imagery of Malones Fairhaired Child.Sorry John Carpenter, I believe your directing days are over.

Too dark to be a dark comedy and to light to be a serious drama, Vodka Lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately disgruntled.

I believe it gets old, and that is the case here.There is nothing surprising in this movie, but then, the story has been told a million times before. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player, and his conceit shows through in his characterization. De Niro plays the obsessed fan, but his role in this film is less than entertaining.However, because De Niro is IN this film, that makes it a draw if you are a fan no pun intended who sees everything he does no matter how bad.

I am a huge baseball fan so I thought I would watch it, and I was very disappointed. It started out okay.. When I saw the bad influence DeNiro had on his young son, I was hoping that he would become a better father throughout the movie or something. Anyways, at the beginning it seemed as if DeNiro was supposed to be the protagonist. He was the only one that believed in Bobby, and he had his adorable son that he was losing custody of, which gave me a reason to feel bad for him. He wanted to help Bobby by talking to Primo, when out of absolutely nowhere he brutally stabs Primo to death... Not to mention that sketchy reoccurring song I WANT TO  YOU!!!! at random unfitting moments.Later, when DeNiro saves Bobbys son from drowning, I was hoping that the movie could redeem itself.. He could forgive himself for killing Primo if he saved Bobbys son. But of course this is far beyond the depth of the movie, because all he cares about is getting CREDIT for the murder, and does so by stealing Bobbys son, car, and dog and holding them hostage Bobby just has to hit a home run and announce that DeNiro is a true fan while displaying a picture of him biting a knife.Now we get to the completely unrealistic scene at the end... It is pouring like hell and we are expected to believe that the game has not been called. Then DeNiro somehow magically appears on the field in an umpire suit and calls Bobby out at home, proceeding to pull out his knife and start stabbing everyone that runs onto the field. There are seemingly no officers on the field but the police are on their way, so DeNiro steps on the mound and prepares to pitch a knife to Bobby when he gets shot to death. But do not worry, this cheerful and pleasant movie has a happy ending, because Bobby find his son.This is NOT a sports movie. It is NOT about a fan. As far as I know, fans are not rabid psychopaths that threaten, rob, and throw knives at their admirees. This is likely to be the sickest movie I will ever see in my life.

I found it slightly difficult to believe that Renard would have started out as a frustrated obsessive sports fan into being an out and out psychoThe character arc is not the only problem with this script  It also lacks a character focus  A problem I had with THE UNTOUCHABLES where De Niro should have been superb but ended up slightly flat  , for several stretches of the movie I kept thinking that Bobby Rayburn was the main character then the story switches back to Renard . It also seems to have disappointed a lot of sports fans who seem to think this should have concentrated a bit more on baseball .

It was used in the seventies horror Deathline aka Raw Meat, featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel, and the celebrated chase sequence in American Werewolf in London. So I was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent UK production Creep.I thought the film started off well, with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving, followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of London. However, Creep went downhill from here, and I found myself wishing that I would switched it off after this opening scene, leaving me with a favourable impression of the film. All the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable, even Potente herself, and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness. he also made the mistake of showing the monster in full lighting, where he ceases to become remotely scary, and reveals his name to be Craig. How can you have a monster called Craig? It turns into an X Filestype thing, and reminds one of the episode Tombs. In fact, I was wishing Mulder and Scully would turn up and sort them all out for me.As for the infamous sexualised violence, it is very graphic, disturbing and totally unnecessary. It seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value. The trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror, which is a mistake as it is only halfway through the film.So there you go. The only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from Ken Campbell, one of my favourite occasional actors. You do not see him very often, but when he is on screen he acts everyone else into a corner. Casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius, unfortunately the only one evident in the film.","label":0},{"index":8144,"txt":"Maladolescenza has the air of a dark fairy tale, with its child protagonists, forest setting, and the discovery of a castles ruins.

Opening with a dream sequence employing the notsosubtle metaphor of Fabrizio wrestling with his menacing hound, the film details his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who has pledged her love to him, and his eventual romance with the equally malicious Sylvia. The films psychological complexities do give the film merit, yet there is no doubting how unnecessarily exploitive the film is in its depiction of nudity and sex. The films look relies more on its gorgeous locations rather than particular cinematographic skill, and there is no doubting the films greatest asset is the creepy, childrens choiraugmented soundtrack. With its odd dreamlike quality, the film is at best interesting, yet pales beside Louis Malles surreal and brilliant Black Moon from the same era. Certainly deserving of the art versus pornography debate, for unlike many banned films, Pasolinis Salo or Larry Clarks Ken Park for instance, the film is rather unremarkable from an artistic perspective. Cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock, so perhaps Maladolescenza should be admired for retaining that power thirty years after its release.

In fact, the only thing that distinguishes it from a 1960s70s television series like The Rat Patrol is a bigger cast and a lot more violence. James Garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to break away from all the light comedy stuff he had been doing Maverick, Support Your Local SheriffGunfighter etc.. Unfortunately his earthy likability works against him, as Sledge is a humorless character written to cash in on the popularity of Clint Eastwoods spaghetti western character. But Eastwoods stuff was not this flat and uninteresting.I suppose that A Man Called Sledge could be classified as a spaghetti western although the pacing is too slow to really fit that subgenre. Fans of the slowpaced Combat television series will feel an instant connection as Vic Morrow directed the film and cowrote the script with Frank Kowalski. Throw in some then trendy slowmo shots and crossdissolves, which call attention to themselves rather than serve a storytelling purpose. The plot is the standard big heist thing insert The War Wagon here with Sledge plotting how to heist a 300,000 gold shipment. His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that while on the move the shipment is guarded by 40 outriders and while stopped it is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of Alias Smith and Jones with the same plot.The story would make a decent hour of television but gets old very fast as a very padded feature length film. Garner does not allow any of his charm to leak into his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to hold a viewers interest.The thing finally crashes and burns shortly after the heist when the gang engages in a contrived and totally illogical card game.

Folks like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And of course we have Vic Morrow who both wrote and directed this film.Garner always gets cast as likable rogues because he is so darn good at playing them. But he has played serious and done it well in films like The Childrens Hour and Hour of the Gun. He can and has broken away from his usual stereotyped part successfully. But A Man Called Sledge cannot be counted as one of his successes.He is got the title role as Luther Sledge notorious outlaw with a big price on his head. After partner Tony Young gets killed in a saloon and Garner takes appropriate Eastwood style measures, he is followed from the saloon by John Marley.Marleys spent time in the nearby territorial prison and it seems as though gold shipments are put under lock and key there on a rest stop for the folks transporting the stuff on a regular run. Garner gets his gang together for a heist.Heres where the movie goes totally off the wall. Usually heist films show the protagonists going into a lot of methodical planning. Certainly that was the case in The War Wagon which some other reviewer cited. But in this one Garner decides to break into the prison as a prisoner of fake US Marshal Dennis Weaver and cause a jailbreak at which time the gold will be robbed. That was just too much to swallow. If taking the gold was this easy it should have been done a long time before. But I will say for those who like the blood and guts of Italian westerns, during that prison break there is enough there for three movies.That is not the whole thing, of course the outlaws fall out and we have another gore fest before the film ends.

The script clomps from event to event,leaving puzzlers aplenty. Why did the aliens blind the dog? Why do they fry the soldiers with radiation when they are only patrolling an empty landing site? And what space dudes worth their moon cheese abduct the ugly photographer first instead of his model? Inquiring minds want to know!

It is a fitting movie for that time slot since it is really hard to follow and quite odd see the other reviews for specific story info. Anyway, after catching it numerous times in those days just before cable TV And even after it hit but before they offered much all night programming, I kept catching this little oddity. After not seeing it for many years I decided to see if I could find it on DVD. Well, it is only available from every search i have conducted anywayin a pretty lousy grainy print on the budget label Brentwood Video as part of a 4pack of movies 4 movies on 2 double sided discscalled Alien Worlds if anyone is interested. It is usually available for around 10but even much less if you shop around. The other 3 movies on this set are readily available in numerous other collections of public domain movies, so no need to comment on them here. But I have not seen Eyes available anywhere else. Though hardly a restored version in any way, this print runs exactly 92 minutes, so for once IMDbs stated running time of 90 minutes is not correct. Even with the 92 minute running time it is not unusual for a movie dubbed into English from another language to also have some of the running time trimmed. It seems to be a common budgetconscience practice to sometimes save money by not bothering to dub some scenes at all if they are not considered to be important to the story. Would a longer version make in any less confusing? Who really knowsunless you have seen it in it is native language... By the way, my attempts to watch this during the day do not work and I end up just turning it off. There is something about watching this in the middle of the night that just fits this movie..or maybe it is just from my earlier experiences, who know??","label":0},{"index":8151,"txt":"This film was not nearly as much of a chore as I expected it to be. There are a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore UFO conspiracy paranoiafest. Most of the acting is mediocre, but fairly typical for 1970sstyle stuff replete with pregnant pauses. A photographer and a model witness some strange goingson in the woods and soon fall victim to these same goingson. Flying saucers are spotted, more people disappear  but is it the aliens or our own governments ultrasecret group of coverup guys? Soon enough, a reporter and a UFOlogist apparently modeled on the character of the writerdirector are drawn into this unraveling fiasco and become the target of the ultrasecret agents who are as menacing as they are improbable and witless. Then the fun really begins.The movie, predictably, makes about as much sense as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but should be commended for taking itself so seriously. The camera work is OK for a lowbudget film, the pacing is pretty good, the script is silly and absurd, and there are continuity issues which are fun to look out for. What are the few seconds of brilliance I mentioned? Honestly, I cannot say much you without writing a spoiler.

Saddled with the worst haircut EVER in the history of everything, the man just wandered around looking like a stunned fish in a bad wig till kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of Plexiglas by some aliens. The aliens are most effectively not seen as a POV shot  hand held camera with a fisheye lens  sort of spooky the first time but, used over and over again it lost its power incidentaly, if it is a Point of View shot, it means the aliens always walk out of rooms backwards for some reason.The film was set in England. This meant the Spanish Italian set designers put some British number plates on a couple of English cars and put a Union Jack on our heros press card... and that was about it. No other attempt to make it look like the UK at all.Favourite moment?

And now I am compelled to write a review about it because I am afraid I will start forgetting everything about it FAST. You see, even though EBTS as not bad, it is VERY dull and nondescript. The story is sorta interesting but flat. The actors are good but their roles are boring and a little confusing. The FX are terribly amateurish but I can overlook something like that if the movie is compelling, which, unfortunately, this one as not.Also, there is very little violence and there is no nudity whatsoever, which makes this 1970s Italian scifi opus a TRUE oddity, because if there is one thing that distinguishes Italian genre movies made in the 1970s from genre movies of other countries made in the same decade, it is the astonishing amount of violence and sex to be found in them. Oddly enough, because of the almost complete lack of exploitive elements, EBTS stands out from the rest of the pact. I do not know if this can be seen as a compliment though. Personally, I can enjoy a movie without sex and violence but I think EBTS NEEDED more violence and some sex here and there to spice it up because it is so deadly dull and dry. And the special effects are not that special.The story itself is actually interesting. It is a combo of THE XFILES and Antonionis BLOWUP a photographer accidentally captures aliens on film during a fashion shoot in the country. The aliens know they were captured on film and they proceed to kidnap the photographer and a model, subsequently destroying any evidence of their presence on earth. The problem starts when the model meets a man at the recently abducted photographers apartment this taking place just before she is to be abducted herself. The man takes some of the negatives and leaves, with the aliens having no knowledge of the missing negatives. The whole story is about this man wanting to know more about the aliens and a secret spy group who want to get a hold of the negatives. The majority of the movie centers around boring political intrigue, in the spy vs spy variety. The UFO element of the story is almost unimportant and could have easily been replaced by any cold war McGuffin. But as dull as EYES BEHIND THE STARS is, it does resemble THE XFILES a LOT! I wonder if Chris Carter saw this movie. Anyway, the best thing in EBTS are the POV shots, which are creepy and effective. But the rest is almost completely forgettable, including the goofy looking aliens.Even though I have been mostly negative about this film, I sorta cherish it nonetheless. I still remember the effective ad campaign which scared me when I saw it as a kid. And I own the video. The film could have been so much more if it had been done properly. Oh well...","label":0},{"index":8154,"txt":"Creep is the story of Kate Potente, an intensely unlikeable bourgeois bitch that finds herself somehow sleeping through the noise of the last underground train, and waking up to find herself locked in the tube station. After somehow meeting workmate and wouldbe rapist Guy on a mystery train that runs after the lines have closed, things go awry and she finds herself pursued by what lurks beneath the citys streets. Her story is linked to that of George Blackwood, an excon working in the sewer system; they meet in the final third of the film, brought together by their attempts to escape the monster that pursues them.The pair proceed through a set of increasingly unlikely locations; from the Tube station, they end up in the sewage works before somehow finding themselves in some sort of abandoned underground surgery. Most Tube stations do not have toilets, so how one has a surgery is beyond me. Naturally, the film cares to explain that the surgery does not have running water. Yet it has electricity? Just one of many inconsistencies that work against the atmosphere of everyday believability that the film tries to create.The monster itself is a problem. There is a complete lack of reasoning for its actions, it just kills people for no obvious reason. And then of course it keeps some alive for no real reason either, perhaps just so that they can eventually escape and give the film an extra 15 minutes or so running time. I understand that natural evil is supposed to be scary, but then the film attempts to explain itself via a photo of a doctor and his son, and a few shots of some jars containing babies, and yes, it is just as tired and pathetic as it sounds. It also fails to explain how the creature has been underground long enough to lose the ability to speak, communicating only in raptor screams, but not long enough for its pair of shorts to decay. Hmm.This doctor business leads to scene that is the films desperate attempt to implant itself on your memory, and while it is gory and uncomfortable to watch, it just is not enough. The final third of the film hinges on an emotional relationship that never existed, and the characters break down and recover for little or no obvious reason. George breaks down, unable to cope with something despite stating that he wants to escape so he can see his daughter again, and Kate becomes emotionally tough seconds after going to pieces over someone that ripped her off for a travelcard. Yeah.After starting out as a this could happen to anyone movie, it quickly falls apart as it introduces ideas that make it more and more unrealistic. A complete lack of emotional interest in the characters and an absence of suspense make this one to avoid.","label":0},{"index":8155,"txt":"Originally called The Changer. The Nostril Picker is a poorly constructed tale about a loner named Joe Bukowski Carl Zschering who likes em young. Unable to socially interact with girls he bumps into a tramp who teaches him a special Vietnamese chant. This chant involves whistling London Bridge is Falling Down whilst hopping around like an epileptic morris dancer. Nonetheless, Ugly Joe tries it out and hey presto! He is now a girl. Ideally he needs to be a young guy in order attract girls. But lets not talk about ideals here  this film was made in 1983 and released in 1993, in an ideal world it should have NEVER been released.The Film Asylum dubbed this horror hokum as mind numbing, ham handed story telling. Its worse than that. The Nostril Picker really takes the biscuit, in fact the whole goddamn cookie jar. Terribly scripted dialogue delivered by braindead actors, a ridiculous plot and a predictable twist. Just when things could not get any more absurd the story goes off on its own nonsensical tangent. For instance, Joe decides to kill the girls by changing back into himself. But i thought he wanted to get close to them? Not content with being a murderer Joe also turns into a cannibal and eats some of his victims, of which there were only around 34.The highlight of this terrible movie involves Joe picking up a hooker Steven Andrews then taking her back to his apartment. What happens next defies belief... Joe turns back into a man, but also discovers the hooker is a man. How does he react? Well, in a Benny Hillesquire fashion, he chases her around the apartment with a bunch of squirty dildos only to trip up on a blow up doll. God knows what Patrick J Matthews and Stephen Hodge were thinking of. At least this scene paved the way for another priceless moment. This involved the male hooker reporting the incident to a curly haired police officer with a 2bit joke shop cop uniform. The hilarious acting is a must see. Especially the hookers inability at saying dildo and his demand for satisfaction.Apart from the above mentioned incident this monotonous slash flick was a complete bore. You know a movies bad when the DVD trailers were more exciting. Normally, i would fast forward to the good bits, only there were not any here. The main action sequences involved Joe simply stabbing his victims repeatedly. Forget quick cuts, Matthews utilizes fadeouts one during a stab scene to limit any form of suspense there might already be. One girls nonreaction to her fingers being chopped off is laughable. Normally i would relish the words uncut but in this case they were far from a blessing. Just more agonizing cinematic torture. The whole movie felt like an unedited episode of Midsummer Murders, only less entertaining. I would hate to see the cut version.To sum up, The Nostril picker is the most unentertaining thing i have seen since Richard Hammonds 5 O Clock Show. Dismal performances made worse by a terribly tinny soundtrack and bad dubbing. Do not be fooled by the box label, this is NOT a cult classic unless it qualifies for the letsuseshittyhorrordvdsforcoffeecoasters cult. Which i think it does.

The fashions and music dictate that this is seriously 80s.

A strange loner meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favourite song he will be able to turn into whomever he chooses. At this point I feel obliged to point out that the loners favourite song is London Bridge Is Falling Down. Why is this his favourite song? Because he is an idiot. We are only a minute into the film and already the film has reached a monumental level of stupidity. It gets even stupider.The loner is the nostril picker. I can only assume this as there are two scenes in the film where he is seen picking his nose. That clears up the title. He decides to change into a girl so that he can get close to other girls. And kill them. That is more or less it.The acting is universally appalling. Every single performance in this movie sucks. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the acting is of the standard of a pornographic movie. It really is that terrible. The nostril picker appears to the audience as the nostril picker. The characters in the movie see him as the girl he has become through singing London Bridge Is Falling Down. Man, I feel like an idiot even typing this. Anyway, it is kind of strange seeing a middle aged weirdo hanging out with school girls. And not in a good way. There is even an extended montage of scenes where the nostril picker is at school with the girls and a song plays over the top. It is very possibly the worst song ever recorded. I am not even going to describe it. You will know it when you hear it. And you will agree with me.There are some scenes of violence, sure. And there is a Benny Hill style chase sequence involving a transsexual.

The Nostril Picker is one such film, The Nostril Picker is like no other film I have ever seen, unfortunately for The Nostril Picker  myself it is unique for different reasons than what the filmmakers had originally intended. Read on  all shall hopefully become clear... The Nostril Picker, as it is commonly know although it was apparently filmed under the title The Changer, starts with some extremely dull shots of an American town somewhere, streets  factorys that sort of thing, as the opening credits play. When The Nostril Picker begins proper we, the viewer that is, are introduced to a real loser named Joe Bukowski Carl Zschering who is in his 40s, he lives on his own in a crappy little apartment where he watches T.V., eats beef flavoured dog food  listens to old vinyl records as he dances with a blow up rubber sex doll. Joe likes teenage girls, he has various porn magazines but enjoys the real thing even more. However, being an ugly git Joe cannot tempt any young ladies to go out with him, or do anything else with him for that matter. One fateful day an old homeless Vietnam vet Horace Grimm sees the agony  pain that Joe has to go through actually he sees Joe being spoken to by the cops for hassling a teenage girl  decides to help him out. He tells Joe about an incantation that he learned from the gooks in Vietnam that will transform Joes appearance into whatever he likes. A process he calls morphosynthesis, but at the same time he warns Joe that it makes you crazy if you do it too much. That night Joe decides to give it a try, in a public place on a podium for some reason. Joe says a few words, does an extremely silly dance  starts yodelling. Joe finishes off by whistling London Bridge is Falling Down, listen yeah, I as not making this up either. At first Joe is visibly disappointed when nothing significant happens. To console himself Joe tries to buy a porn mag but is shocked when the clerk Kevin Devoy refuses to sell it to an underage girl. Joe, the bright spark that he is, realises what has happened  talks hisher way out of it by claiming hisher dad had sent himher to buy it. Joe, who now calls his alterego Josephine Ann Flood, senses the possibilities  heads straight for the local high school. Joe befriends four teenage girls, Jennifer Armstrong Laura Cummings, Crisi Stroud Gail Didia, Tracy Harper Heidi M. Gregg  Brenda Kearn Aimee Molinaro while under his disguise, oh  Joe manages to become a pupil at the school simply by asking the sports teacher Miss Van Dyke Vicki Hollis. At first Joe seems harmless enough, he just likes to hang around the girls toilets  stuff like that. But things soon change as Joe brutally murders Brenda. Jennifers dad, Vince Armstrong Edward Tanner is a detective so along with his partner Ed Simpson Clyde Surrell  Walt Spencer Bruce Alden the pathologist is determined to catch the sicko responsible for killing his daughters friends, but will they succeed before Joe strikes again? The IMDb listing for The Nostril Picker is wrong, I watched it mere hours ago  it clearly states that it is directed by Mark Nowicki who was also a coproducer  definitely not Patrick J. Matthews who was credited as a coproducer  the cinematographer, not that it makes much difference  I would have though that Nowicki would have been more than happy for Matthews to take the credit for making this piece of crap. No one involved in the making of The Nostril Picker should be allowed to go anywhere near a camera again, ever. The Nostril Picker is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen,  that is saying something. It is absolutely terrible in every possible way imaginable. The script by Steven Hodge is atrocious, there is no narrative structure, excitement, tension, drama, character development  the things that do happen are so mind numbingly dumb it is untrue. The plot devices  chain of events in The Nostril Picker are totally incomprehensible. The scene where Joe finds out the prostitute Steven Andrews he hired is in fact a man  Joe starts to chase him around his apartment with two squirting dildos is simply jaw dropping stuff. The subsequent scene when the transvestite reports the incident to the police is hilariously written  had me psychically laughing at the dialogue. I hated the ending as well, not only was it predictable but it leaves the door open for a sequel, I psychically shudder at the mere thought! On a technical level The Nostril Picker is awful, point  hope photography, bland  inappropriate music, forgettable locations, poorly edited Brenda is killed in the kitchen yet her blood splashes on the T.V. screen that was clearly in the opposite room, some of the worst acting I have sat through  very unimpressive special effects which consist of a few cut off rubber fingers, a slit throat  a quick scene where Joe eats some flesh. It comes as no surprise that the cast  crew who worked on The Nostril Picker have virtually no IMDb credits for anything before or after. Even at 76 odd minutes The Nostril Picker is far to long  really boring to sit through. I could go on  on all day long about how bad The Nostril Picker is, I really could. One thing I cannot quite work out is was all this intentional by the filmmakers? The Nostril Picker is indeed a unique film, unique in it is awfulness  incompetence. In the the case of The Nostril Picker I hope it remains unique too, having said that it is still not the worst film I have ever seen but it comes close that is for sure.

He would have been better off finding someone with a day job, or someone who excels at painting a picture with words like a poet, but then they might not have a hot bod.After he gets her to do whatever he wants and he is not terribly good at it, he intends to feed on her at 6 AM, at which point the sun rises. Much is made of that deadline, despite the fact that he also says that he can go without feeding, it will just make him hungrier. Additionally, he claims he cannot let the stripper go, since she knows about him, but he lets a number of other people go who learn what he is. There are a lot of inconsistencies.Why this vampire chooses to live in a house so poorly boarded up that light from streetlamps and neighboring buildings pours in as if it were daytime, I am not sure. With all the time in the world, you would think he would have done a better job, or fixed the place up a bit. He is clearly not a wealthy vampire.This is supposedly a remake, and I am curious to see the original version of this, Dance of the Damned. Although, that was directed by Katt Shea, and the other films she directed for Corman Stripped to Kill, StK II were pretty bad.","label":0},{"index":8169,"txt":"This movie features Charlie Spradling dancing in a strip club.

The acting is criminal, the direction practically nonexistent, and the special effects presumably put together by unleashing a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenceless laptop computer.Far be it from me to stifle creativity, but I actually believe things like this should not be made. I am sure the filmmakers will say that, yes, the film was hampered by a low as in nothing budget  but in that case they just really should not have bothered. As it is, they have offered the world something so dire, so execrable, that only imbeciles could get the merest shade of enjoyment from it.Starting the movie it was not as though I was expecting Citizen Kane or anything. I was expecting a low budget little horror with perhaps a modicum of inventiveness, a hint of fun, and even some energy. What I got was the cinematic equivalent of a used handkerchief.The plot? Well, our leering antihero scientist, who works in his parents basement, is seen manically stirring some goo in a cup. Apparently, such highlevel science is the endresult of years of research. His parents then send him off to a strange hoteltype place in the countryside to relax. There are some other people there, who are simply too awful to write about. Anyway, the scientist drops his testtube onto some mushrooms  and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people. Wow, I am getting suicidal just writing the plot summary. Our heroes save the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar by attaching a fuse  really a piece of string  to it. The barrel unaccountably explodes with the power of a small nuclear weapon, destroying all the mushrooms. The end. Thank goodness.That summary is as good as the film gets and actually makes it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is. It really should never have got past this stage of development by which I mean a plot outline scribbled on the back of an envelope with crayons. Somebody should have really stepped in and given someone a vigorous shake and said NO. And those special effects. Well, they are special all right. This is CGI gone crazy. And done by a person who I can only assume believes the bicycle pump to be the pinnacle of modern technology. And when the mushroom monsters are not in the style of a 1984 home computer graphics package, they are represented by actors shuffling along covered in a sheet I kid you not.One of the most inexcusable things about the movie is its laziness. This can be summed up by the scene in which the hero spins his guns a la Clint Eastwood and then fails miserably to get them in his pockets. I mean come on, a couple of retakes and he could have pulled it off, but just to leave it as it is  really weak.I cannot believe money was spent on this camcordershot rubbish. The filmmakers should hang their heads in shame and be banned from going within fifty metres of any moviemaking equipment.I also think it is wrong that friends and family of the makers come onto IMDb and post mendacious reviews and give stupidly high user ratings which give a totally inaccurate picture of the movie.

The most positive comment I can make about it is that the people responsible seemed to realize that it was superlowbudget nonsense, so there is at least a sense of fun here.But this is as amateurish as it gets. Their idea of giant killer mushrooms are simply guys covered with beige colored sheets with what looks like trash can covers on their heads.

On the other hand, starting in the 1980s, actual acting talent seemed to be less and less of a required ability in Hollywood, so Bo could very well have gone onto bigger and better things after the big box office take of Blake Edwards 10. That is if she had not allowed her husband, John Derek, to take over her career. Numerous Playboy spreads and bad movies like this one this one in particular directed by John destroyed what momentum she had and made her the butt of many a joke. In the 1980s it was assumed that you could put a certain personality in a certain movie and it would be box office gold. John figured that putting Bo in a movie wherein she was nude for much of the running time would make people flock to the theaters after the 10 hype. Maybe if the movie had been any good perhaps. This version of Tarzan has got to be the all time worst of the many iterpretations of Burroughs lord of the jungle, a slap in the face to characters book and film legacy. Tarzan is in fact an after thought as the film is primarily a vehicle for Bos breasts and Richard Harris wonderful over acting remember, the pair had worked together in Orca. His scenery chewing helps you to stay awake during the boredom of it all and yes, the film is quite boring. Nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by someone in a trance. Bos body can only get you so far. Miles OKeeffe who played Tarzan at least would go onto a long and enjoyable B movie career and Richard Harris can put this behind him after his recent acting triumphs, but Bo and John Derek never recovered from this fiasco and future collaborations between the two only served to show why his directing career and her acting career died in the first place.And how did the orangutan get to Africa?","label":0},{"index":8180,"txt":"I was thirteen years old, when I saw this movie.

Some of the IMDb reviews address this point, but heres my .02I am aware of only twocount emcinema depictions of Tarzan, namely Greystoke with Christopher Lambert and the Disney animated version, that try to depict Edgar Rice Burroughs rather interesting character the son of a marooned English noble couple, picked up after their death by a tribe of apes who raise him as one of themselves, and who becomes lord of the jungle because of his superior human intellect before making it back to England and claiming his other identity rather than the usual Hollywood jungleman whose origin remains obscure and whose trademarks are his famous yell, his mysterious inability to speak proper English despite long exposure to people who know the language, his habit of swinging on vines, his strength, heroism, etc. About the only thing these two characters have in common are the name Tarzan and the fact that they both have a wife named Jane. Ron Elys TV version is something of a compromise Like Burroughs character, he speaks good English and is adept and suave in both cultures in a sort of JamesBondish way, but he is no Lord Greystoke and there is no Jane.Well, this film is in a third category of Tarzan films, and I hope it remains a category of one because it is awful. This category uses the character as a vehicle for, of all things, soft porn. Jane, played by legendarily bad actress Bo Derek is in Africa looking for her dad the absentminded professor who is combing the jungle looking for something which is never specified. Though her dad is supposed to have been missing for a long time, she finds him effortlessly. Richard Harris as the dad is the best thing here; he sees the film is stupid so he has fun overacting and hamming in a way that reminds me of Peter OTooles deliberately silly performance in What is New Pussycat. Dad explains the legend of Tarzan some sort of ghost or spirit he sayseither a steal from, or an inartistic attempt at homage to, King Kong to his daughter, who is at this point unfamiliar with the apeman. Shortly afterward, we hear the infamous clich\u00e9 of the Tarzan yell. Dad dies, which oddly does not seem to faze his devoted daughter very much. And then.....Then Tarzan appears, but says nothing. Indeed, he says nothing during the entire film. He and Jane fall in love, and they romp around wearing almost nothing as she recites doggerel lovepoetry offscreen. The End. That is the plot. Well, not exactly; there is also a scene where Tarzan wrestles unrealistically with a boa constrictora most unusual boa, since it is the only poisonous one ever seen. Jane treats the bite with the aid of a chimp who helps by wringing out the garment she tears off to bind the wound with I am not making this up!, and this is only one of many excuses for her to take her clothes off.I always like to conclude a review by saying something positive, but this time it is hard. Let us see... well, it is unfair to criticize this film for featuring an orangutan, even though we all know orangutans do not live in Africa; after all, the classic Tarzan movies all used Indian elephants, did they not? Also, you have to admit that Bo Derek is pretty in face and form. But in that case why the hell did not she just make a career as an art model? What does it say about a movie when it becomes plain boring to look at a pretty woman? I actually have not decided whether it is a positive or a negative that they never showed her crotch.

She would not win any awards even at her best, but she is no worse than many an actress who has made it big in the past 15 years or so based on looks alone. But therein lay the problem, John was determined to ride the wave that Bo created with her appearance in 10, that of Bo being the perfect 10, the hottest woman in America, the sex symbol of the 1980s. Problem is, in Johns hands, this wave crashed with a resounding thud in only a few years time. Maybe he knew her limitations as an actress, perhaps that is why he fashioned movies for her that concentrated on her body, not her acting skills. But it got old real quick. It did not help matters any that the films of John and Bo Derek are let us be honest really, really bad. And bad sums up their take on Edgar Rice Burroughs literary icon, the Lord of the Jungle, Tarzan of the Apes.You know what is worst? This film is boring! Make me laugh, make me cry, just do not bore me. Not even Bos stunning looks and figure can rouse any interest, and that is what the film is of course built around. Richard Harris God bless his soul, he and Bo were previously in Orca btw hams it up and makes his scenes at least a little interesting and Miles OKeefe makes a physically impressive Tarzan. Maybe he got the last laugh, after being hit with a ton of venom from the critics over this film, Miles went on to a solid career as a B movie icon, in films that were not great art, but a million times more fun than this one. But other than that, it is Bos body,and you can only see it so many times before you long for something else to go with it. Tarzan the Ape Man has nothing else. John Derek was a truly dynamic actor, he was not a director. He should have stayed with his strength. This film unfolds at a mind numbingly slow pace and nothing really happens in the action scenes. Burroughs Tarzan was all about excitement and wish fulfillment who would not want to be as agile, strong and good looking as Lord Greystoke? and fun! You get none of that here. Watch it, and you will have wasted 107 minutes of your life. On second thought, you may come away with a valuable lesson, how not to handle someones movie career. Bo Derek is all right in my book though. She stood by John until his dying day, has a true love of animals and nature and even looks back with a giggle at her time in the spotlight. She has also proven that she is not the dumb blonde many want her to make her out to be. If she could survive Tarzan and Bolero, she can survive anything.

Bo has as few lines as possible when bodies are explored because this movie is merely a videocenterfold, as neutral as possible so that you can project yourself and your lecherous fantasies into the project.

There is only a hairsbreadth difference between the two formats and I am just guessing here a horny viewer would probably really enjoy the latter. The question is whether a mainstream movie is the best venue in the marketplace for viewers to seek out products that satisfy lust alone.As a showman, John Derek successfully capitalized on the sexual mystique developed over wife Bo in the movie 10; and created a media event out of a shallow project whose only merit was the hotness of the two leads. The movie itself was beside the point. He was about 20 years ahead of his time in thinking audiences would applaud him for making an insipid, shallow movie that was only about showcasing superficiality.As a director, John Derek appears to require only that Mrs. Derek look pleasant, empty and humpable in every scene. It is hideously shot. The camera placement is annoying. In terms of editing, the entire wipe catalog is exhausted. The credit sequence is garish. And it is a tossup as to who commits the worse screen offense; Bo Derek who is such a bimbo that she cannot even figure out how to play a bimbo, or Richard Harris who shouts every line as he likes to do until you want to shoot him.

Despite a charming closing credit sequence showing Tarzan and Jane playing with around with an orangutan and a music score that is not half bad actually and quite rousing on occasion, any belated good intentions are defeated by an extremely silly climax involving natives painting Bo completely white and, fatally, John Derek\u2019s clear disinterest in the character of Tarzan himself which makes him come off as an unimportant supporting character in his own selftitled movie!!","label":0},{"index":8192,"txt":"When I was a teenager seeing this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. However, now that I am older, I can honestly say that this film is awful. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husbanddirector John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. But when you take that aspect out of the film, it becomes one big dull ride. And Tarzan, well, he is all muscular like you think he should be, but when he sees Jane that is Bo, of course for the first time, he does not know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet seethru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem.

If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and worthwhile film, go elsewhere...almost anywhere else at that!!!","label":0},{"index":8193,"txt":"It is a great tragedy that both Richard Harris and John Derek are no longer with us. But that should not blind anybody to the fact that in 1981, a pretty ugly blotch appears on both mens CVs. No doubt John Derek conceived this movie doing for his wife what Some Like it Hot and One Million Years BC did for Maryln Monroe and Raquel Welsh respectively, creating an iconic sex symbol for the new decade. Having run to embrace Dudley Moore on the beach in 10 Bos reputation, an allstar cast and location filming in Sri Lanka meant that nothing could go wrong. Alas, as they say, Mortals plan and God laughs. It is said that when this film premiered in 1981, the Edgar Rice Burrows estate tried to take legal action against it. Bo Derek plays Jane Parker who sets off into turnofthe century Africa to be reunited with her boozy, abusive Dad, Richard Harris. Daddy Parker is an explorer who has set out to find the Great Inland Sea the stuff of local legend, whose existence has been poopooed by conventional wisdom. Harris is worth watching for a wonderfully hammy, tanked up performance which includes singing an Irish ditty at an Indian elephant that somehow found its way into Africa did it arrive at the same time as the OrangUtan from Sumatra??? Furthermore, although Jane professes to despise Parker, Bo and Richs relationship is creepily incestuous, testimony perhaps to the effects of the tropical heat. Before long, however, local legends start to circulate about a Great White Ape and Jane hears the famous yodel. This is the movies cue for Miles OKeefe, a future BMovie star, making a rather odd debut as the loinclothed Lord of the Jungle. Unlike Johnny Weismuller with his pidgin English or Ron Ely who speaks the language fluently, the OKeefe Tarzan is mute. Given some of Bo and Richies dialog, though, this is probably not a bad thing. Harris and his caravan eventually reaches the Great Inland Sea, located atop a gigantic plateau that seems to run halfway across Africa....hang on, are not seas, lakes and other watery places generally located in lowlying areas?? Nevermind, it is just one of many anomalies in the John Derek universe. The crew attempt to mount the cliffs and when the ropes snap, Harris roars echoing abuse at the hapless men who have plummeted to their deaths. On another occasion, Jane decides to take a nude swim by the Inland Sea, giving another occasion to see some gratuitous nudity. Out of nowhere a single male lion appears. Now lions usually travel in prides and never go near beaches but later on, Tarzan will be wrestling with a venomous boa constrictor. Zoology does not seem to have been one of John Dereks strong points..... This being a Tarzan movie, Jane becomes enchanted with the Lord of the Jungle and resolves to take his virginity. But having seen his closeness to some of those chimps, you do have to wonder...Speaking of which, it is not only the Edgar Rice Burroughs estate could have sued. It is highly probable that certain primates were on the phone to their lawyers the chimps here make you miss Cheeta badly. Especially when they do ridiculous things like ride on the backs of elephants and clap their hands when Tarzan and Jane finally get it on! The climax of this film has Bo and Harris captured by some rather stereotypical cannibals who paint our heroine and prepare to sacrificeeatexecute her. Suffice is to say that The Great Wooden Ape gets his girl and SPOILER Harris gets himself impaled on a huge elephant tusk! This does not stop the dying Parker from delivering a rambling monologue to Jane. As far as I am aware, the law suit from the Rice Burrows estate never materialized but Tarzan the Ape Man was crucified at the box office no kidding? A pity.

In any event, all of his tricks are reminiscent of the greater funny men, but he lacks the acrobatic skills of Keaton and the prodigious ingenuity of Lloyd. He also undermines his own persona by dressing and walking like Chaplins tramp character. His trademarks are childlike innocence, timidity of approach and a tendency to underreact to calamity by looking perplexed, batting his eyes or touching his pursed lips with the tip of his forefinger. The comedy in Langdons films results from fate throwing various obstacles in his path which he tries to overcome in wimpy or na\u00efve ways or with a minimum of physicality, such as throwing rocks at an approaching tornado to drive it away, propping up a collapsing building with a twobyfour or dodging boulders by lifting a leg so that they roll under him.

Of course, he fights his way to the lead villain, and of course they have a fancydancy fight, with an ending that will surprise only those who have never seen a marshal arts film.

I must have seen scenes from this dreadful excuse for a film over a dozen times, and I can always spot it from 12 seconds of screen time. However, aside from the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts, the bad dubbing, the stiff dialog, and the outrageously difficult storyline, the film has some things going for it. With all that is bad about the movie visually, the sound is actually pretty entertaining. Never before has a punch or kick landed with so little force and so much volume! The canned kungfu sounds are cheeky, but the slowed and pitcheddown music, and the nearly 5 minute slow motion scene are truly weird. The chase through the city of demented, bloodthirsty villagers is not really tense as much as it is irritating, and there are enough bad wigs and extras who all but look into the camera and wave to make this trainwreck a little fun.

A schizophrenic is not a normal man with a disease, it is someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people  for him, things like time, space, and peoples personalities are not solid things. He feels it can be bent, it can change, it can mutate, and maybe even disappear. To cope with this, a schizophrenic has a rich, very imaginative inner world which normal people do not expect  but he is trapped in it because he cannot relate with most people, and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank, delusive dead end.This is very different to what is depicted in this ridiculous cure, tearjerking movie. It should be violently frightening. People other than the main character should appear strange, weird and absurd, like in Lynchs Eraserhead, for example. There should be really impressive, weird, gross hallucinations, because that is what schizophrenia is all about. It is not about details.I mean, watch Naked Lunch, Lost Highway, read P.K. Dicks Martian TimeSplit or Ubik, DO watch The Cell, Perfect Blue, Dark City, or play American McGees Alice on PC, and you may have a vague idea of what it is like. Do not watch the feel good movie of the month, with banal situations, cleaned characters and visuals, and stupid plot tricks. The Cell is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenics mind, his visions and his inner consistency  it is violent, weird, confusing, and very, very scary.Once again, Schizophrenia is not about details, it is not a neat, tame trick played to you. It jumps in your face and will not let you go  walls fall apart, people turn into strange hostile creatures, you feel like you go backward in time, you are not sure you are who you think you are, everything feels... strange, unnatural. Believe me, this is much much more than what is depicted in this soaplike melodrama","label":0},{"index":8224,"txt":"When many people say it is the worst movie I have ever seen, they tend to say that about virtually any movie they did not like. However, of the nearly 700 movies I can remember ever seeing this one is one of two that I walked away from feeling personally insulted and angry. This is my first movie review, by the way, and I registered with IMDb just to rave at this movies badness. I went to see it when it was in the theaters myself and my two buddies were 3 of 5 people there, and after 15 years I cannot remember very many specifics, but my attitude upon leaving the theater is still crystal clear.Spoiler alertOh my, where to begin. Fat loser left at altar, goes on ski weekend, meets blonde bombshell who takes an interest in him, takes him home to meet the family, they are all cannibals and he is the main course, pathetic attempt at a dramatic escape, kicks all their butts and runs off with the brothers girlfriend, they live happily ever after. Puke. Firstly, the gags are so bad that it took me a while to understand that they were trying to be FUNNY, and that this was a COMEDY. The special effects, what few there are, look like they were done 15 years earlier. The big dramatic ending was so hokey and poorly acted that it was nearly unbearable to watch he knocks out the entire cannibal family with rakes laying in the lawn, that stand up Tom and Jerry style when they step on them.

As soon as it was announced that the Doctors arch enemy the Master was going to be played by Eric Roberts everyone scratched their heads and exclaimed  Who is Eric Roberts ?  . I should point out this was before the IMDB came online when all you had to do was type in a name into this website to their resume , but one helpful soul wrote into a publication I wrote for to explain that Eric Roberts was best known for a role where he starred opposite F Murray Abraham , the film was called BY THE SWORD and was about a fencing school . Actually looking back now Roberts is best known for THE POPE OF GREENWICH VILLAGE and RUNAWAY TRAIN but that didnt stop the person putting the boot into both Roberts and BY THE SWORD and his mind was made up that this American Master with his southern drawl was going to a debacle . Strangely most fans were furious about Roberts playing the Master but after they saw the DOCTOR WHO TVM a great many fans  Myself among them  thought Roberts performance was the best thing about the disappointing American production Yeah Im digressing but BY THE SWORD was a film that I wanted to see simply because it was the first time Id heard the name of Eric Roberts but I didnt get the chance to see it untill this weekend and I was fairly disappointed with it . I know nothing about fencing  Everyone else on this page seems duty bound to mention if they fence or not . I dont fence  so I dont know how accurate it all is , but as mentioned the film feels somewhat anachronistic even if you saw it on its release in 1991 , the hairstyles seem a few years out of date along with its mixed teenage cast doing a little dance routine that makes you wonder if it wouldnt have worked a lot better if itd had been produced by Jerry Bruckheimer in the mid 1980s .

In the end it did not do any of those convincingly or completely enough to make me give one ounce of care of any of it.For the record I also am a fencing instructor and now I am officially as bad as the rest. But putting bad fencing in a movie does not make it bad automatically. I mean look at Star Wars Episodes 46, good movies, bad fencing. I liked those movies. But when you put bad sports into a bad movie for some reason people think that it is only the purists that think it a lame effort.Do not be fooled by any comments on the smaller issue of fencing. This is just a bad movie. In the end, this movie has nothing for the fencing enthusiast or the movie buff or simply anyone with a pulse and three brain cells.When I see a movie and am forced to think, Man, I wish I was watching the Mighty Ducks.

And the sequel to it, Scarecrow Slayer was even worse! Yes, probably, when it first came out, there was a huge rave about it and people liked it. But when movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose come out, movies like these make movies like Scarecrow seem childish. If you want a movie to just pass the time, pick this one!

Oh well! The storyline is pretty basic stuff, but it was well done  peaceful kung fu fighter played by Chen Hui Min accidentally kills a man and promises never to fight again. He then runs away to work as a labourer on a pier where he impresses his coworkers with his heavy sack lifting prowess, causing them to suspect him to be a formidable fighter dont quite know how that works but never mind. Meanwhile, the corrupt boss of the pier does a deal with gangsters, giving them exclusive use of the pier. As a result, the workers are thrown out on their ear and forced to live on the beach, where they unite against their boss, the gangster boss, and his hulking henchman Bolo Yeung.While the film was quite watchable mainly through waiting for the next glimpse of Bolo, i had a few problems with it  firstly, the bad dubbing, but of course thats a given in old kung fu films. But also, the film tended to drag between the various fightscenes. And as for the fight scenes themselves, i found them to be overlong, badly choreographed apparently by Jackie Chan!, badly shot and at times performed by people who did not seem to have any martial arts ability.... in fact, most of the fights in this film were not fights at all, just people getting beaten up without offering any resistance!Finally, the hero  played by Chen Hui Min. I have never seen any other films with this guy in, but at no point was i rooting for him. Not only did he look wimpy and on the verge of tears at all times, but i found his insistence on not fighting infuriating! I understood his reasoning, but he could have saved a lot of people a lot of pain if he had done earlier what we all knew he was gonna do eventually, and fight! A bigger mystery was why this entire community of people were pinning their hopes on a guy they have never even seen fight! Really, the big saving grace in this film was the presence of Bolo Yeung. Not only is he as huge and brutal as ever, he has some great, funny lines and gives the rest of the cast a masterclass on how to fight on film. The guy oozes screen presence and you can easily see how he became a star. The guy scares the life out of me, but i am sure i was not the only person to have watched this film who was rooting for Bolo all through the end fight!

I researched the plot, read reviews, and even looked at some photos to make sure it seemed like a good gory and scary movie to watch before downloading it. So excited it had finished and ready to be scared and recoiling in horror at the amazing gore i was expecting i was terribly disappointed. The plot was ridiculous and did not even make sense and left too much unexplained, the gore was hilarious rather then horrifying, and what was with the cartoon style sound effects ? The acting was probably the only thing mildly scary about it. I did not understand the cactus idea and the way the mothers husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after following a flashing light, they left both pretty unexplained, or perhaps i missed it as my mind could not understand what i was actually seeing. I appreciate the way it was supposed to be; shocking and a few scenes the strange cannibalism and own mother kissing?certainly were, i just think they went a little bit far and not even in a horrifying way, they made it to unconvincing which made it more believable to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion. However it is a very entertaining film and got a lot of laughs out of me and a couple of friends, but sadly we were expecting horror not comedy so its worth a watch for the entertainment value, but do not be expecting a dark, deeply scary and horrifying film; you will just be disappointed.

From a simple misunderstanding of the chain of Constitutional authority, Haig is transformed from a public servant who really should have brushed up on his remedial civics into a raving megalomaniac.

Having been a TV reporter at the time of these events, I was stunned that I had never heard anything about the bizarre behavior of Secretary Haig as portrayed by Richard Dreyfuss. The whole nation had heard the I am in control..., etc., but Dreufuss Haig is bullying a cowered cabinet and totally out of control personally.

They did not happen! There is internal conflict, to be sure. Haig makes missteps, his press room performance is historically regrettable and he is difficult. But there is nothing approaching the scenes depicted in the film. There are too many gross errors to list, but any fair comparison of the recorded and written record and the fantasy of this film begs the question as to what the producers were really trying to accomplish.

In conclusion, do not waste your time watching this movie, it could quite possibly be the only thing you regret.","label":0},{"index":8254,"txt":"First off, let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie This entire movie had to have been a dare. You know, like, DUDE, I BET YOU Could not MAKE THE WORST MOVIE EVER. With this movie, they have made a good effort at achieving that title. The effects are, of course, poor. The plotdialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every B horror movie ever made. The actors, I am assuming, are supposed to be in college. Yet parts of it especially at the beginning make it seem like they are supposed to be in high or middle school. It makes no sense. The Scarecrow going around killing people is not the least bit enjoyable.

Just because you have directed a ton of music videos DOES NOT make you qualified to make movies. The movie had an overabundance of lingering shots that made no sense, horrible angles, and terrible lighting. The editing did not help this mess at all. When Dixie shows up late for the memorial service her mother remarks about her hand but it is never clear what the heck she is talking about.2. The plot had promise, but the script was thin and full of Ford Truck sized holes. We never get to understand what drives the characters, what is really behind the conflicts they all have with each other or exactly how they resolve them. Sixteen years of distance is wiped out in 4 days seemingly by magic. The deep conversations were marred by stupid clich\u00e9s. In fact, the whole town was one big clich\u00e9 of southern life. Half the audience groaned when Toby drawled Ya got my blood runnin through your veins gurl...and we were treated to that insipid line not once, but TWICE! The revelations were yawn inducing, and the dramatic confessions boiled down to I was stupid and stubborn.3. The acting was okay considering the wreck of a script they had to work with. Toby was dark and brooding most of the film, but when he smiled and lightened up he was charming. It is a shame he did not have more screen time like that. Kelly Prestons acting chops are pretty rusty and it shows. Lindsay Haun is talented and it is certainly not her fault the writers made her character so unlikeable in the beginning that you do not blame her father for not coming to look for her. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper were able to make more of this movie but still looked more or less lost. And indeed, their characters get lost in this film! 4. If you are a Toby fan you will love the songs. But often the movie felt like a scene was forced in just so they could feature one of his songsor the artists on his record label. For instance, the movies official love song is Crash Here Tonight. You would think that would play around a tender love scene, but nope...we hear about 45 seconds of it as he is heading to a memorial service. It was as if they said well, we gotta use this song somewhere. The song Broken is haunting and the best thing to come out of this movie.In summary...a promising plot never fully develops and the movie is horribly uneven as it forceably tries to be a vehicle for Toby Keiths music and product placement for Ford Trucks. It goes from being about people rebuilding broken bridges to trying to be about the power of music but the story is told so poorly that both points get lost in this overgrown music video. I like Toby and really wanted to like Broken Bridges but the people he counted on to make this movie let him down and deserve one of his famous boots you know where.","label":0},{"index":8256,"txt":"If you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3K, Attack of the Giant Leeches, or Pinata Survival Island, this movie might be for you.I live in Nashville and I did not even know of this movies existence until the day prior to its release, when the advertising company panicked and blanketed Music Row with dozens of fliers and billboards. It barely lasted two weeks in theaters anyway.Bad acting, bad writing, and poor production only begin to describe this embarrassment of a film. For starters, the names are a bit much Bo Price, Angel, and Dixie? Eesh.Tobys awkwardly slow delivery of lines makes one wonder what production assistant got stuck holding the cue cards off camera. Angels character rapidly transitions from her cityslicker ways to a cowgirl, slipping into southern slang after two days on the ranch. Her wardrobe goes from chic to a female version of Tobysin fact, in the final scene, their outfits are identical, making one wonder if the wardrobe assistant called in sick.The audio is inconsistent  perhaps the most noticeable example is when Toby decides to go for a swim and his voice suddenly sounds like he is shouting in a gymnasium.There is never quite enough explanation or character development to suffice what happens onscreen.

One contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a core.The movie also has a back story about another person brother of the lead character trying to patch things up with his girlfriend, I reckon this part of the story was a waste of time, this also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and was not needed to be shown.However apart from that, this movie does have some good underwater photography and the colors blend in well which is why it receives 4 stars.

By far the worst adaptation of one of my favourite novels. The dialogue was horribly clumsy; I could sense no feeling behind the words expressed by the characters. The lines were delivered too hastily and felt rather out of place. They could just as well have been cited by statues. The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York was nonexistent and watching an American Rochester felt strange. He could have at least tried to do a British accent. I like George C. Scott as an actor, but this simply did not work. I felt like I was watching highlights from Jane Eyre, where the main pieces of the story had been randomly put together with no regard to the flow of the story. The scenery and music were all very nice, but I could feel none of the passion and love that is supposed to be between Jane and Rochester and the movie left me totally unmoved.If you want to see a good version of Jane Eyre I suggest you watch the 1983 BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or the 1997 version with Ciar\u00e1n Hinds and Samantha Morton.

The characters hardly speak to each other, so the rich banter enjoyed in the book that is the basis for their deep intellectual and abiding love, is gone.

All you figure is that they deserved it one way or another. The scarecrows character was overdone, and a cheap ripoff of the other great fantasy killers such as Freddy or Pinhead. Next BAD DIALOG The Scarecrow was full of horrid oneliners that would make you laugh, only because it was so terrible.

A very cheap laugh, or even a giggle.","label":0},{"index":8266,"txt":"This TV production of 1970 starring Susannah York and George C. Scott is another proof of how difficult it is to adopt Jane Eyre to the screen, and how much can go wrong in doing so. It is true that the movie suffered in the transfer to DVD  some scenes which were complete in the original were shortened and so badly edited that there are striking continuity gaps and that even one crucial scene between Jane and Rochester starts in the middle of a sentence! But even if the editing were better, the film would not be. The script is bad, the portrayal of the characters is untrue to the novel and nearly all actors are miscast. As a consequence one does not have the feeling of watching an adaptation of Charlotte Bront\u00ebs novel at all. The problem is not only that a number of scenes are shortened or left out  this is the case with all the short adaptations  but that the remaining scenes do no at all capture the tone, the spirit, the atmosphere and the concept of the novel.This Jane Eyre for example completely leaves out Gateshead and begins with Janes arrival at Lowood. While this is perfectly all right, since some scenes must by necessity be left out, it is not understandable that, instead of using the time gained so to speak and thoroughly portraying Janes friendship with Helen, the influence Helen has for Janes development, the lecture in Christian stoicism that she teaches her, the film nearly exclusively concentrates on the physical illtreatment of Helen, which is driven to absurd extremes in this adaptation. What Helen has to suffer is bad enough as described in the novel, but here Miss Scatchard is portrayed as a kind of sadistic prison ward, who deliberately wants to drive Helen to a premature death. And this is about all which happens at Lowood. If you compare that to the deep impact the years spent in Lowood have on Jane in the novel, one can only state with regret that the movie does not even touch the surface of that particular episode in Janes life. And this is the problem throughout this adaptation It rushes from scene to scene, very often without transition, and nowhere comes even near the essence of the novel. The dialogues are an odd mixture of madeup lines and lines from the novel, very clumsily patched together, and the scenes between Jane and Rochester are so shortened that both share only 5 minutes together on screen before they fall in love, and the little conversation they have contains nothing of the brilliance, the intensity and also the humour of the conversations between Rochester and Jane in the novel. But the scriptwriter not only did Bront\u00ebs language injustice but in addition managed to ruin her moral setup with just one sentence. When Rochester and Jane go to see Rochesters wife after the wouldbe wedding, Rochester says Yet I once loved her his wife as I love you now. The whole moral concept of the novel depends on the fact that Rochester is indeed an innocent victim of an amoral scheme and was trapped into marrying a mad woman whom he never loved, and that his effort to seek a true life partner is, if not sanctified by Gods and mans law, yet understandable and forgivable! But this one sentence completely undermines Bront\u00ebs whole carefully constructed moral concept and turns Rochester into a dirty old man who wants a new young wife because his old one is of no use to him any longer.From the errors regarding the script to the errors regarding the casting Now I am by no means one of those who insist on physical resemblance between an actor and the literary figure he portrays, but by no stretch of imagination is it possible to picture lovely, blonde, blueeyed and fullmouthed Susannah York as the novels plain heroine. In addition, Ms York was in her thirties when the film was shot and looks it. Played by her, the novels shy, reserved and inexperienced young Jane becomes a perfectly poised, graceful and mature woman, completely sure of herself and her deserts. I do not say that Susannah York does not play well and convincingly but the woman she portrays is not Bront\u00ebs Jane Eyre. To cast George C. Scott as Rochester must have been motivated by the desire to have a Rochester who looked old enough to make the 18 years difference in age between Jane and Rochester plausible. Scott looks as if he were around 50 but acts in various scenes as if he were 70.To compliment the maturity of the leading actors all passion, desire and despair seems to have been deliberately wrung out of the script. The scene between Jane and Rochester after the wedding, the emotional climax of the novel, has become a calm, rational conversation between two middleaged persons, at the end of which Rochester falls asleep. When Jane returns to him in the last scene, he is just as mildly pleased as a grandfather who has just been paid a visit in his old peoples home by his favourite granddaughter. The only character who displays an appropriate amount of emotion is St. John, of all people. Ian Bannen plays him so passionately and his eager plea for Janes love is so touching that one gets the impression that Bannen was modelling his St. John on the Rochester of the novel. But good though Bannen is, his St. John is just as far from the novel as Yorks Jane and Scotts Rochester. The only redeeming features of this very disappointing Jane Eyre are the locations and the score, and I would only recommend this production to those who want to watch and compare every single adaptation of Jane Eyre.","label":0},{"index":8267,"txt":"I watched this film, along with every other adaptation I could get my hands on including seeing plays in preparation for some academic research.

All of his most fundamental traits are gone. Where is his wit? Where is his passion? Scotts Rochester more closely resembles Rochesters foil, St.John, than the character from the novel. In fact, the actor playing St.John in this adaptation played a passionate St.John while Scott is content to smash things or just stare at the ceiling which he does all the time.

If the director considers what I saw in the last couple of minutes as great ecstasy, I have to say that that is not even close.The use of cinematography is also not mature. Most of the time I could not see any facial expressions from the actors and I did not feel the body language was sufficient enough to make an impact. Maybe the crew was just so tired that they fixed the camera there to include everything in the settings. Everybody happy except the audience.The plot is particularly weak. There are a lot of unrelated scenes and talking which might be supposed to be related but they are really so random that you can never pull them all together, perhaps unless you are the one who wrote them.In the one and a half hour you may find less than 5 minutes of real acting and all other time there are just people walking, talking and moving.

The problem with the realism is that the characters are so patently unrealistic and atypical  contrary to the fetid imaginings of extreme filmmakers most teenagers are not drug addled rapists. As a critique of the Iraq war, a film about youth violence by a talented classical musician  subtext society has damaged this sensitive individualis so infantile as to hardly bear thinking about. There are signs of technical ability but some reviewers have overstated this. Like Kubrick and Noe he does show that the desire to shock linked with supposed serious intent may be the worst cinematic con trick of recent film. People liked Clockwork Orange and Irreversible because they liked the rapes and the violence, but most of all they liked feeling culturally superior for liking things that most hated. So too much Kubrick and not enough Haneke a serious and moral filmmaker here labels this as one of the most moronic films in years. I am not against violence in film.

Only this teacher was not selfish, just someone in several roles, caring for his pupils, \u00e1nd worried about his script. I think it is a simplification to call him selfish.

At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he overcompensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to tone down the character, to nuance his temperament to give The Sunshine Boys some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if we would all gone deaf.

An earlier scene successfully conveyed the mood they were apparently striving for, but without rubbing your face in the extreme and explicit sexual violence. This film should have a big WARNING label on it. For these reasons I would not recommend anyone seeing it. You have been warned.","label":0},{"index":8279,"txt":"I have seen it. It is not good but interesting in an understated way. The boys in it are quite naturalistic but................the graphicgratuitous final gang rape scene is repugnant and oh yes the arbitrary insertion of second world war footage is offensive in the way it attempts to compare real horror with this misogynistic contrivance. Real atrocity is real this film is just atrocious. However, the film has a look which can draw you in. But it seems to me that is the Emperors New Clothes, but in fact in reverse. The film looks good, but the direction, story, content and final feeling you take away from this film is vacuous.

In this film the violence is about as crass as you could ask for. In the Great Ecstacy the director has successfully demonstrated what extremes of violence people are capable of. But what was the point? The violence looks like a mix of No\u00ebs Irreversible, and  Kubricks Clockwork Orange...both of which are remarkable films. Do not get me wrong, I am not opposed to screen violence at all and I have seen some nasty stuff in my filmgoing years, but this film as a whole is totally juvenile. The story is never developed enough to offer any reason for the extreme violence, the rizla paper thin reason we are give for Roberts demise is his introduction to drugs. Danny Dyer plays the character who is partly responsible for Roberts drug fuelled demise, however he is on screen for less than 5 minutes. Lesley Manville is Roberts unable to cope mum, I am not sure what either of these actors is doing in a film of this low caliber. The acting is wooden, the scene in the kitchen with the TVcook and his wife for instance is as painful to watch if not more so than the shocking finale who wrote those dialogues?! Some of the comments the boys make...looks like she is enjoying it are so trite as to tempt one to laugh if it were not for Clays ardent desire to bombard us with harrowing images of mutilated female genitals. Why we need to be shown such detail possibly down to the directors adolescent obsession with sadistic pornographic imagery...one can only wonder at this young mans psychology.The political meaning of the film was repeatedly brought to our attention due to the amount of scenes; in the bar, outside the TVcooks house, war in Iraq reports, was perhaps too obvious in my opinion. Yes, war is violent, social determinism causes frustration, we are all prone to horrifingly violent acts whether you are in politics or on the street popping E. Juxtaposing all these things as part of the same underlying issue is evading the actual issue which is the meaning of violence in man. This issue is one that we still have not managed to grasp and certainly not in this film.My opinion derivative, badlymade and pointless.","label":0},{"index":8283,"txt":"So they hyped the violence and it is been branded as sick. Well, the violence is the best bit I am afraid, but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they go on their entirely predictable rampage. This film has a truly dreadful script. We never get a chance to get to know Robert and his actions at the end are just plain pathetic. The acting is not much better, either, the worst of them being the TV chef and the school teacher. The direction is clumsy, the pace enough to send you to sleep. And what on earth is the school film project all about? A comment on the film itself perhaps? The use of newsreel during the climactic murder is laughable. These guys obviously think they are intellectuals but are hopelessly out of their depth. How on earth they got the great Yorgos Arvanitis to light it I will never know.

That is the trouble with young people these days, they have no respect.Seriously this film should be avoided at all costs. The action in the main body of the film is slow and rather stodgy and ambles to the drug crazed ending as if, like it is director, it has no where better to go. We are introduced to the main title character who is a bit of an outsider, we see him at school and at home not quite fitting in, feeling awkward in himself as so many adolescents do. Robert falls in with bad lads and starts missing school and taking drugs and before you know it he is a psycho rapist.The film is really about Clays total failure to understand the links between violence imagery and violent acts. Clay seems to think a generation of crazed youth are made evil by scenes of war on our TVs. yet he has filmed the most disgusting piece of SIMULATED violence. Is this guy for real?If Clay has not seen YouTube perhaps he is naive and unaware of will be done with the brutal climax scene from his film? All anyone will want to see is the most hideous scene from the end of the film and I am sure that will be what sticks with people. The rest of the film is pointless for in committing such an act of violence to film Clay not only damns young people who are actively engaged in preventing war, he also damns himself as perpetrator of extreme, tasteless violence for no better reason than his own personal celebrity status.Shame on all involved.","label":0},{"index":8285,"txt":"This movie commits what I would call an emotional rape on the viewer. The movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in Cannes, but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed. Hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency or any other issue, for that matter.The main characters metamorphosis from good, but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent, whereas the rape scene being an overdragged, exaggerated version of the rape scene from A clockwork orange is unbearable and I refuse to comment on its aesthetic values. There are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve hisher goal. At least in my opinion.To wrap it up shockingly brutal, revolting and NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.

The director clearly has talent but like his character Robert Carmichael he throws it all away.Carmichael has potential, but like Cray he cannot be bothered to use it. Being drawn into petty crime and then descending into depravity is Crays vision of British youth. Like the British tabloids this film portrays young people with no aspirations or respect. Cray cries out for attention, but deserves none.I was appalled by the act of violence that Cray chose to shove in the faces of the audience. He assumes the audience are ignorant of world atrocities. Like a piece of obscene graffiti on a toilet wall he shows us male depravity with adolescent glee.Some actors of quality have small parts in this film. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville both make short appearances. The acting is otherwise amateur, the young men Joe and Ben are cringe making. Carmichael played by Daniel Spencer is creepy. Miranda Wilson plays Monica, the attractive wife of celeb chef Jonathon Michael Howe; how she was able to subject herself to such an ordeal is beyond belief. The film is never subtle and Monica is treated to the most gratuitous violence which is cut with war action. War imagery is used to convey the idea that young men cannot help themselves, that acts of violence will occur within even civilised countries. This is most certainly true and is symptomatic of our altered society where males have an increasingly less important position, but Cray descends to the level of the barbaric males he seeks to expose through his use of such brutal and violent images. The female characters in the film offer no relief. They are either victims or in Manvilles case a washed out mother. The community is represented as dysfunctional.This is Crays first film. I listened to what he had to say during a Q and A session at Edinburugh and he is not unintelligent, he simply lacks experience and his film exposes his naivety. The film is due to be released later this year, but I hope the company goes bust cos the public really do not need this kind of messed up material.","label":0},{"index":8287,"txt":"I am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film. Look at it a month later and you might see it differently, or dig it up after 50 years in a different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first. After sitting through The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael at its UK premiere, it came as no surprise to me that I found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself. Shane Danielsen Artistic Director of the Edinburgh International Film Festival, aided by the films director and producer, gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience. Edinburgh Festival audiences are not easily shocked. Only one person walked out in disgust. The criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches M.A. film directors. This was not an overly shocking film. There was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence, but far less extreme than many movies most actual weapon contact was obscured, as were aroused genitals. The audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring, where the acting standards were not high, where the plot was poor, predictable and drawn out, and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious filmmaking on the promise of a controversial movie. Metaphors to the war in Iraq are contrived, overemphasised and sloppy apart from a general allusion to violence, any deeper meaning is unclear; and the figleaf reference Marquis de Sade, as one audience member put it, seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finale.We have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him he stands out at school for his musical ability but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence. When pushed, Robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside him.The film is not entirely without merit. The audience is left to decide how Robert got that way was it the influence of his peers? Why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life? Cinematically, there is a carefullymontaged scene where he hangs back whether through too much drugs, shyness, a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn?. Several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room, partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen. In the foreground of the bare bones flat, a DJ is more concerned that the girls screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman. Ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention. The stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way. Robert slumps with his back to us in the foreground.But the rest of the film, including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable if not overly realistic sexual violence, is not up to this standard. Some people have had a strong reaction to it the filmmakers stated intention If they vomit, we have succeeded in producing a reaction but mostly  and as far as I can tell the Edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from Cannes  they feel, Why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality filmmaking? Director Clay Hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision. His replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet, even his defence that there is little plot development because he did not want to do a standard Hollywood movie  all are good answers to criticisms, but unfortunately they do not apply to his film, any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates, or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols. Wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt, I spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening, but I found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial. There are many truths. One aspect of art is to educate, another to entertain, another to inspire. I had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions Ken Loach one of the many great names he takes in vain without going so far as to admit any agenda himself. He then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth. I am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director, or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate workAndy Warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was art. Clay Hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries. Sadly, his ability at the moment only extends to making highsounding excuses for a publicityseeking film.","label":0},{"index":8288,"txt":"I saw this not too long ago, and I must say This movie is terrible.

For a while I hoped at least the story will surprise me, but then realized it is a waste of time, there was just nothing there. I stayed only because I had another show after it.Design some designs where quite beautiful, mostly of the environment, but the characters were terrible both in terms of animation and design. They look great while still  on posters and screenshots, but not when they have to come to life! They just did not work, mostly because the very same mistake most 3D companies make technically it is very hard to create really natural materials in 3D, that would make you feel that the character is alive. You need a lot of effort and knowledge hence money to create something that really feels like hair, skin, fabric, etc. Those characters in the movie were made out of cloth, and that just did not work! So they had this ugly cold feeling of the computer artificiality, where the cloth stretches or squeezes like a piece of plastic. It just did not have the feel of a material, that dolls are made of that is what those characters meant to be. I think it was a big mistake choosing this style for the characters. It just had a feeling of a 3D shootnrun computer game. I do not want to go to cinema to have a computer game on my screen, do not know about you...Animation was also a disgrace. I am a professional animator and was terribly disappointed at the low level of animation in 9. It was stiff, boring, almost lacked any imagination or mood. It was just a little bit above most average 3D animations I saw, and that does not add to it any good...And all that  the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story, right?! That was not the case here. Actually the story was the worst thing in that movie. It was below any level. It starts straight forward, it goes straight forward and it ends the same. There is no twist, no surprise, no good dialogs, even no development. We have heard and saw stories of machines overtaking the humankind thousands of times and 9 is just one of them, and we know how it ends at the very first minute of that movie. The characters do not even have time to get into the story  they are just there, showing themselves almost immediately, and immediately some of them take action without even getting to know what is going on. It just did not work. There are also many repetitive action sequences, that looked as if they were made to fill in the time for the lack of a story...Acting, sound and script  oh my gosh, what can I tell, it was pathetic. Bad story has a bad script, and except dialogs like No, do not do it! I will do it! But... you cannot do it alone! We can do it together! But there are rules! But we have to save him! etc etc and so on, and repeating itself all the time, so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs, there were those non stop Ahh and Ohhh andEhh, and Oooh, and Whatchout, and Run! and OhOhh! that were following almost every jump, run, or fall of the characters and it even sounded as if they were out of sync or even unrehearsed.Conclusion bad acting, bad animation, bad sound, bad story, bad script, bad characters, everything expected, no surprises, no twist, nothing.

Tim Burton is a brilliant director, but to be honest I have been losing interest in him for a while since his last few movies were either remakes or adaptations. He did produce the brilliant Nightmare Before Christmas, which is one I have watched multiple times, and directed movies like Beetlejuice and Sleepy Hollow, which are awesome films. Bekmambetov directed 3 films that I LOVE Night Watch, Day Watch, and Wanted. I have only seen those three of his, but they prove he is an awesome director.Those two people producing one of the many reasons I was excited to see 9. So today I went to go see it at the theatre. I was so excited to finally have seen it. I had waited 7 months for the movie to come out.This movie is the first time I have walked out of a Tim Burtonrelated movie and said I enjoyed almost NONE of that. I felt heartbroken to even have felt that way. I mean, with him and Bekmambetov at the production helm you would have expected this movie to be a good watch. Right now I still cannot get over how let down I was by this movie. I had not even heard of the original short film before seeing it but now, I can successfully say that this movie should have remained a short movie. Hell, Neil Blomkamp made an AWESOME full length remake of Alive in Joburg entitled District 9, what was so hard to get right about 9??? I really wanted to think this movie was awesome. I really did. But no, it failed on so many levels.The plot was extremely confusing and disjointed. I had no idea what was going on, let alone what it was about. Basically it is about a bunch of rag doll robots trying to save the earth. Well, OK, that is what I got from it. But the writing here is extremely poor. The whole film jumps around like a 6 year old with A.D.D. telling a story. There is this big, giant clanky monster robot that 9 awakens, causing destruction and stuff. That is the main villain. However, what else is wrong with this movie is that EVERYTHING COMES OUT OF NOWHERE. There were too many monster robots, most of which have no logical explanation behind them. They have 0 development whatsoever. I mean, that flying pterodactyl like monster just rips out of nowhere, we have no idea where it comes out of and Acker just expects us to know what it is. What was even more retarded was that snakelike creature with the strobing eyes that hypnotize. I dare you to give that description to someone else out loud and expect them not to laugh. All of the 3 people I told about it burst out laughing. Oh and it wraps victims up and sews them inside it. I am. NOT. KIDDING.The twist in Act III is the most retarded aspect of the whole movie. So basically 9 goes back to the room he woke up in, finds this box with a hologram from the scientist in it for 9, and he tells him that the big scary machine robot was designed to bring robot life to earth, but then evil humans use it for war, and it was supposed to help protect the earth, but then the scientist gave his life to 9 so that it could help protect the world with it. And HE ONLY MENTIONS GIVING HIS LIFE TO 9. But what about the other robots? WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES TO THEM???????? This is the perfect example of poor, rushed writing. There is only one of the life taking device thingy that exists so how did the other 8 get life given to them??????? The characters are not likable at all either. They risk their lives for no reason at all. The only good character is 7. 6 annoyed me with his GO BACK TO THE SOURCE!!!!!! ramblings, 1 is an overpowering idiot, 2 we do not know ANYTHING about, 5 kept annoying me with his Are you sure... or Can I stay here instead...? questions.

Organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful. Science is not portrayed any better. It creates a monster weapon that kills everything... but souls have the power to destroy monsters and bring life? Really?That is something that bites my ass a bit too. Here we have a CGI movie... created with science... and they are using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the decency to have one of the characters ask,Okay, so now what? or something similar.

It was a okay... it was just barely entertaining enough to sit here for the entire movie but now let us get out of here as fast as possible! type of exit.This is one of those movies where you cannot think if you want to enjoy it.

However, the scientist realizes that he is also at fault. He gave the Machine his intellect, but did not give it his heart. The Machine goes Skynet on humanitys collective ass and wipes out all life on earth, finally slowly powering down. However, the scientist manages to survive and create walking sockpuppets. Each one, containing a piece of the scientists soul.The last one, 9 wakes up not knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets up with another like himself, 2. Well, 2 gets captured by a last surviving robot of the Machine. 9 finds more like himself ands sets off to rescue 2. They succeed.9 notices that there is a matching hole that fits the device perfectly. He inserts it and the Machine comes back to life... pulling out 2s soul in the process.The movie then continues with action scenes with 9 trying to rescue his soulyanked compatriots. They eventually succeed and destroy the Machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who go up into the clouds. It then rains and we see life returning back to the planet.Hunh?!?That makes no sense. None at all. Why the heck did the scientist want to split his soul into 9 homunculi? What did it accomplish? Were they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother?!?Why did he expect nine little critters to succeed when nothing else had? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a soul to fight the first.. at least that would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance at success.Why did they have to have their souls sucked into the device by the Machine and then destroy the Machine and then release the souls in order to bring life back to earth?

I have been a fan of Gram Parsons for a long time, and when i found out they were making a film about him i was very exited, I got the movie on VHS when it came out, and was sickened by what i saw, This film was not about his life, it was about the aftermath of his death. I thought it would be a descent film about Grams Life and Music, but they had to make a film about his death. I am tired of hearing about his deaths in books and movies, i wanted a film about his life, not his infamous death. I was very Disappointed. I wish people would look at his life, more then his death. The only thing good about this film was its soundtrack. This film is a disappointment to any Gram Parsons Fan.","label":0},{"index":8301,"txt":"First of all, this movie is not a complete disaster. If you had never heard of the real story of Gram Parsons then it might seem a reasonably entertaining diversion. Johnny Knoxville cannot really be criticised for his performance as Phil Kaufman  he is pretty good at looking laidback and down to earth and you can sort of root for his longsuffering everyman. Michael Shannon is due credit for pretty much the same reasons, except he is a hippy stoner. There are some good individual comedic scenes  the hippyhearse crashing into the airport hanger door stands out. But that is where the good things end, and we begin to see the aspects that make this movie so truly disappointing. The character of Robert Forster as Grams actual father is an invention so disgraceful as to cast a taint over the entire film. We all know his real father committed suicide when he was young  something that could surely be compared to Grams life on the edge by a better filmmaker. Having Forster as his supposed real father, and not his stepfather would be bad enough, if not for the well known difficulties Gram had with the man who actually flew to collect his body. It has been suggested that his step father had admitted to providing Grams mother with alcohol as she lay dying and that this enraged Gram when he later found out about it. Also the controversy over where Grams body was buried would surely be reason enough not to invent a benevolent madeup father who actually catches up to the duo and their hearse, but then allows them to go ahead with the burning. Whatever the truth about the man who Gram got the name Parsons from, he certainly bore no resemblance to Forsters character here, and it is hard to see why this role was written. Then there is the addition of Christina Applegate as a greedy chick yet very pretty of course who wants Grams body back so that she can begin to cash in on his estate. Her character, and her acting are nonexistent and one wonders why the director did not just go the whole hog and include a lesbo scene between her and the chick who plays Kaufmans girlfriendit would not have lowered the tone a whole lot more. When you think of the ingredients that could have been used in a good movie about Parsons, the shortcomings of this film are easily apparent. Country music being changed by a young, polite, southern gentleman  who was also long haired, drug loving, popular with the ladies and ultimately self destructive. Real events like the hanger door crash and the painted hearse and friends like Keith Richards. Instead of these things we have to concentrate wholly on Kaufmans input into Grams life. Kaufman is obviously still lapping up the cult status he received for what he did he certainly is a little cult. From interviews it is obvious that he is delighted with the attention. Remember this is the man who made a remark about the genitalia of the naked corpse of Gram Parsons as he was preparing to set it alight. What he did was not an act of great loyalty, but a doped up alcoholic escapade. Looking at Knoxville and the director in interviews, a few things become clear also. It is obvious that they have no real grasp of the story of Grams life, nor do they wish to have. They want a hit movie about an event that is infamous and crazy. It was an amazing life with a strange end. That the end is the only thing covered by this movie shows how limited an understanding of Gram Parsons the makers had.","label":0},{"index":8302,"txt":"I am not sure if users ought to be allowed to review films after only sitting through half, but I am afraid I just could not stand another minute.If this abject excuse for a film does not have the late, great GP spinning like a wheel in his grave, then I doubt anything will.The excellent review above Not a film for Parsons fans sums up most of my feelings. How dare a second rate director and writer attempt something to which they are so clearly incapable of delivering. What were they thinking? Where to start?THE SCRIPT I thought I would be getting a slice of bittersweet Americana. What I got was poorly executed slapstick with no clich\u00e9 left unturned. Stupid hippy? Check. Stupid fat cop? Check. Awful plot contrivances? Check. Embarrassingly written female characters? Double check. Total disregard for the story which you are trying to portray? Check.After a while, you realize that what you are watching is a soap and not a very well written one at that. Scene with Knoxville. Scene with Ex girlfriend. Scene with Knoxville which has not moved on much. Scene with Ex girlfriend which was a bit like the last one. And so on...THE DIRECTION My friends and I decided, after some consideration, that watching this was like watching a bad episode of Quincy, or maybe a particularly poor Dukes of Hazzard. That is how bad the direction was. Terrible jump cuts, awful camera work, clunky ins and outs to scenes. God, it was cringeworthy. And then I discovered the director was an Irishman who is most noteworthy recent work is a really lousy BBC Sunday night drama called Monarch of the Glen trust me, it is lowest common denominator TV. And then it all made sense...THE ACTING Are we now so critical that when some random guy from the TV decides to give acting a go, if he is not so bad, he stinks, we applaud his efforts? Knoxville JUST ABOUT manages to get through every scene. Poor Christina A. has no such luck. Her performance is a car crash though what you do with those lines, I do not know. The hippy in the hearse oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Have we not moved on since Cheech and Chong?I could go on, but I think you get my drift. What I would say is that, as other reviews have mentioned, no one on this film clearly gives a flying damn for The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers or Grams solo work. They knew nothing about the American road movie and they certainly give a damn about trying to do anything with an admittedly decent story from rock mythology. This film was shallow, failed to explore anything and was jaw droppingly unfunny from beginning to...oh wait, I did not quite make the end. And I suggest you stay away too.","label":0},{"index":8303,"txt":"If you are a fan of the late Gram Parsons then this movie is definitely going to divide you! Part comedy, part road movie, but mostly a bad fictionalization of one of rock historys oddest tales.SPOILERS Basically the story concerns a wellknown roadie named Phil Kaufman played by Johnny Knoxville who supposedly made a pact with cult rockcountryfolk music hero Gram Parsons that stated when one of them died first it did not matter which one it was that the other living one was to take the deceased out to the desert, Joshua Tree National Park in California to be exact, and set the body ablaze...so as to free the spirit and become one with the earth, and so on! Sure to keep his word the barely sober Kaufman, with the assistance of a selfhating, potheaded buddy, jacks the body of the late Parsons whom had fatally overdosed from a drug and booze bender a day prior from the airport. And shortly after that what ensues is a cringeworthy combination of fiction and truth where the late Parsons girlfriend, Kaufmans girlfriend, Parsons stonefaced father, and a gaggle of police officers and other pointless idiotic characters all try to beat the clock so to speak in trying to catch Kaufman and his pal before they get the chance to torch Parsons body! The films incompetent direction, bad acting, and lame offbeat tone in general all sink this movie faster than the Titanic. And not to mention the huge fact that this movie is not even halfway telling the truth of the actual events that took place. The accuracies that should have replaced the inaccuracies, as far as I have heard them, include number 1., Parsons was married at the time of his death and even had a child, so what the hell was that all about with the girlfriends and the chasing and whatnot?, number 2., Kaufmans druggedout buddy was a known willing participant unlike what the movie attempts to portray in the disposing of Parsons body, and finally number 3., Gram Parsons reallife father died when he was just a boy, and so it was Parsons stepfather who could have honestly cared less about Gram Parsons when he was still alive in reallife that took care of the body after it was torched! Altogether though, what probably disturbs me the most about this movie is that the real Phil Kaufman was actually on set to help assist with the facts of the story. And yet still, the movie ended up becoming so untrue and so bad that it really boggles my mind, frankly! Also as the mediocre aforementioned acting in the film is concerned it is lead character, played by the ultragrating Johnny Knoxville Phil Kaufman, is not only a bad actor but it actually seems as if he were asleep throughout most of the movie, and the rest of the pathetic cast are for the most part either hysterical, braindead, or seem utterly clueless as to what they are actually doing there in the first place! Overall, if you like Johnny Knoxville and or really dig the sobadthey arenotevengood buddy flicks then I suppose you just might get a kick out of this movie! But, if you are like me and are a fan of the late Gram Parsons, enjoy films that attempt to tell the truth as much as they can especially if they are based on an actual reallife story, and or you just like good films, bethem road movies, or fictional sliceoflife stuff, you will truly loathe this film and advise others to do likewise. I obviously hated this movie and wished it had never been made in the first place, but since it was made I would have preferred it to have turned out differently than what it did, unfortunately! Maybe some day the real facts of the story will come through and be made into a really great biopic on all of Gram Parsons life...not just what happened to his body after his spirit left it. But, until that time comes all we as an audience, and or fans of the late performer get is this sad waste of film and an allaround terrible memorial of sorts to the musical legacy that Gram Parsons was known to have left behind. It should also be noted that they did actually use Parsons music, and a few others as well in the flick, but not surprisingly though, you never get to hear enough of it to really enjoy it even in the slightest bit.

So, one night at a party, he hears some exroadie tell him a classic bit of rock n roll lore; the one about how Gram Parsons corpse was stolen from LAX by his loyal roadie so he could honor Parsons wishes that he be cremated out in JoshuaTree. Wow!What a great idea for a movie! Rock n Roll well, country, grave robbing, escapes, friendship, the 70s! I guess we could get Johnny Knoxville from Jackass, cause it is kind of a prank, right, and Knoxville wants to do a movie too. Why he must have thought he had the next Snatch on his hand!But this storys not really that exciting...we need something for Knoxville to struggle against.like a psychotic girlfirend after his money! But Parsons was married at the time. That is O.K., no one knows that. Besides we could get Christina Applegate. But what if the audience does not like the idea of stealing a corpse.well, we will get his dad to join the chase, but give permission in the end. But Parsons dad killed himself when he was 10, in fact his orphan status, and tragic childhood, are key parts of the Parsons Mythology. Mythology? We are making A Movie! This is creative problem solving.It is an uncomfortable experience for anybody even vaguely knowledgeable on or interested in the subject. Applegates presence is doubling jarring. First her invented character is a Beverly Hills bitch before her time she might as well have walked around the whole movie a cell phone in her hand, and secondly, what kind of man would Parsons be if he ever associated himself with that kind of harpy? Facts are not just distorted or left out, but REVERSED. They could have easily found the villain they wanted in Parsons STEPfather, who was attempting to whisk the body back to his home state where law would favor him in dividing up the considerable inheritance.And the music, oh, the music I love. The music is hacked up the bridge of a song here, the chorus there, forced to the background, and in the end, horribly covered by the hippest new indie band, Starsailor. My girlfriend asked the unnecessary, but irresistable question after the movie was anyone up there, the writer, the producers, the director, actually a Gram Parsons fan? Well, no. He would never actually heard of Gram Parsons, but of course, blah blah blah, I learned to love it, and heres some factoids I read in a bio online. Another guy vouched for Parsons coolness by saying he and Keith Richards tripped on acid together and wrote Wild Horses together, a mixed up bunch of facts as offbase as the movie. Another person asked, was not it morally questionable to rewrite history when most people would only know about it from this film? Well, he had the real roadies permission he was even set and the Parsons estate gave permission, and all these other people who got paychecks said it was great.But what I really wondered was, and asked in the embarassingly trembling voice of a truly impassioned Parsons geek, was, if the movies so cheaply made a million, had they not considered the original Gram Parsons fanbase as an audience? The director and writer seemed to think he was a nothing figure with no fanbase, though I doubt any Mojo magazine reading, countryrock 70s music fan would agree. But a bunch of Brits made it I guess, and they just did not care about Cosmic American Music, or even knew it existed. This is not just not a truthful Parsons flick, it is not even in the right spirit it does not even fit the legend. At the very least it should have had the sentimentality of one of his songs. And plenty of people would love to be told.I should mention the movie was received well from the bunch of stoned college kids, just off the slopes, and into Johnny Knoxville.

I loved Gram Parsons to be sure and I did not expect much out of this film and got even less. What could have been clever and moving was campy. It was devoid of the music that made Gram and had more filler than cheap dog food. There was no background on Gram or the colorful people of that era. The characters shown were not familiar to me even as a fan of Grams and all the versions of his afterlife adventures I have heard. Rock and roll is full of tales, good ones too but they should taken with a grain of salt. They can be great stories even though exaggerated. However, this movie took a good story and turned into tripe. Stealing any dead body and the ensuing implications should never be a dull tale but they made it dull, somehow.

I wish I had not. It is saddening to see something special be treated as such disgracing fodder. I would swear I could hear Gram turning in his grave while the movie was playing. If you are not familiar with Grams life and legacy, do not take anything in this movie as being representative of Gram.I cannot say enough bad things about this movie.

The film has terrible characters, awful dialogue, an inconsistent  predictable story, it has some cheesy oneliners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he asks can you dig it?  the socalled twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame. The film moves along at a reasonable pace but it is not that exciting  the kills are forgettable. You know I am still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed  killed with a stick of corn...Director Itier does not do a particularly good job here, the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there is never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off. Also I am not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these backflips  somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in The Matrix 1999 or some Japanese kungfu flick! To give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good  he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad oneliners  twirl around a bit. Do not you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring? I know he is a killer scarecrow but I still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day! There is no nudity  the gore is not anything to write home about, there is a decapitation, someones face is burnt, someone is killed with a stick of corn, someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat, some sickles are stuck in peoples heads, someone has their heart ripped out  someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth.With a supposed budget of about 250,000 this was apparently shot in 8 days, well at least they did not waste any time on unimportant things like story  character development. Technically this is pretty much point, shoot  hope for the best stuff. If you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing... The acting sucks, the guy who played Lesters mums bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig  fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film  the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous  do not get me started on his accent...Scarecrow has a few fun moments  the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special makeup effects but as a whole the film is poorly made, badly acted, silly, too predictable  very cheesy. If you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out Scarecrows 1988. Not to be confused with the Gene Hackman  Al Pacino film Scarecrow 1973 or the upcoming horror flick Scarecrow 2008 which is currently in production. Scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels, Scarecrow Slayer 2003  Scarecrow Gone Wild 2004.","label":0},{"index":8322,"txt":"A hint I think may be gathered by the various comments on this thread.I was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it mandatory or compulsory.I think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizing.The Global Warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to do right. It appeals particularly to more liberal leaning people because it does not have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets conservatives who want to force you to be good going.And that is the problem with the film. Al Gore is a politician. And a very successful one at that. He just cannot help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would. The political appeal is just too great.And there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance, reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body politic with a predilection to force other to do right.Another interesting question is how did the Environmental movement get hijacked by such people?","label":0},{"index":8323,"txt":"Something that really does not go down right with Al Gore and his supporterss theory is the whole thing about concensus.If there were such a consensus, why is it that the believers in the almighty global warming feel the irrepressible need to try and bully anyone who questions them.Why is it that anyone who does not toe the line on global warming is met with smug accusations of being either stupid or on the payroll of the oil companies apparently being a professional global warming researcher does not mean you are on anyones payroll in that wondrous world... Why is there such a need to tell everyone how the whole question is settled, when it is the very nature of science to honestly question assumptions? For some ideas on the answer to those questions, read Prey by the wellknow oilstooge Michael Crichton... oh wait, he is rich and not on the payroll of the oil companies. He just took a huge career risk in not toeing the line of the Greens and other Kyoto worshippers and told the truth as he researched it. By the way did you know that abiding to the Kyoto protocol would result in almost no lowering of temperatures, according to its own backers? Just a few questions that Al Gore made sure to stay away from lest he not get every penny of the environmental lobby in case he decides to run again.So who is a stooge..?","label":0},{"index":8324,"txt":"Let us be honest shall we? Al Gore no more TRULY cares about the environment than most folks care about contacting foot fungus. It is a hook! Make no mistake, Al Gore is a POLITICIAN! Three years ago he was bustedticketed in his home state doing 70 mph in a 55 mph zone driving NOT a hybrid, a Yugo, or even a GM Metro but a LINCOLN go google it if you like! Or how about the fact that Mr. Gore  his Hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuelguzzling jets to attend the premiers of An Inconvenient Truth. So much for conservation huh, Al? Anyway, it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at An Inconvenient Truth  discover the main fundamental flaw. While the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the EFFECTS of supposed global Warming there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed CAUSE of it. For example I can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot  they can point out an automobile which is not running right. BUT can they tell you with any degree of certainty WHY? Generally not! A second flaw, just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago the toilet was not even invented yet? What did they have, a June bug in a match box? Hell, even 5060 years ago? Therefore, how do we know with ANY degree of certainty that the planet is getting warmer when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best? Or that man is THE sole cause of it? The answer is we do not  Science is NEVER a consensus. Thirty years ago, Time Magazine did a cover proclaiming a New Ice Age. The truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in Earth Science will tell you that Volcanic Erruptions, Solar Activity  El Ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed Global Warming. Finally, what Al Gore fails to adequately address is; even IF America decides to follow the global gospel according to Al  implement everything he recommends, how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we cannot even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism? Answer It is wishful thinking, Mr. Gore  you being a former VP of the USA know it! If the folks who produced An Inconvenient Truth were really honest, they would have titled their film Al Gore Wants Attention. But what I would really like is for someone to ask the former VP this; why were two of the planets biggest polluters AKA China  India EXEMPT from abiding by the Kyoto Accords?

Just Google Global Warming and Hoax or Junk Science and you will find a river of information refuting nearly every link in the chain of logic that Gore sites. The reason it is so important for people to educate themselves is the disastrous economic impact that global warming prevention measures would have. Wake up people.

Do not just read articles that support your present opinions, read everything you can find. There is no indepth analysis to make, really. There is simply too many alternate possibilities and counterevidence for the theory to have even the most basic level of scientific credibility. It is so uncredible, in fact, that it may be the single biggest hoax in the course of human existence.

I will just call it a natural progression. Let the apocalypse begin, but meanwhile, we have to listen to the same brazen, slanted politicians who propose another new society, well, do not be fooled, we will all still be controlled by the wealthy, by those in power and by those idiots who created the catastrophes in the first place. Nothing will ever change.Al Gore, whose hypocrisy is quite evident in the film, as he is being driven in a gas guzzling car all alone using a consumerist computer, he also lives on huge acres of land in a rather large mansion, the land itself was used for destructive erosive purposes including cattle, tobacco, pig farming which accounts for methane gas traces and who knows what else, his wealth is predicated on exploitation, greed and his investments include numerous large companies in the world with disputable records. I hardly think this man is qualified to lecture the less fortunate, but his prestige is based on his opposition to another ludicrous political party, that is all, meanwhile he emits those very same rancid characteristics that make politics and politicians so appalling. This bozo happens to be living the comfortable life and yet he is lecturing poor people in Africa about crop farming and cut and burn techniques? He travels across the world in first class seats in fuel wasting jets, uses product placed computers in the documentary, and yet he thinks everything is a moral issue. He is entirely absorbed in his own deluded nightmares, he says he came to these conclusions because of the death of his sister from tobacco induced cancer and the near death of his son by an automobile of all things. Did he fight against the tobacco companies or propose that automobiles be banned because they are dangerous hulking machines? NO. Everything must serve the economy, so why is he any different, the answer is he is not.His forlorn and exhausted attempts at humanistic philosophy are disastrous, all this while he is being filmed in the forest or along a little river eschewing stale life affirming quotes. Well Mr Gore, why do not you try living like the common people then? He is a politician, plain and simple, he has a career invested in the power structure. My question is, why does not he concentrate on the powerful industrial nations of the earth who are to blame for most of the complications? He does not do that because it would be unwise for investments, stocks and corporations.Al Gore gives monotonous lectures about the subject in the documentary, namely to wealthy white people in the audience, who clap on cue, while showing them graph charts, numbers and percentages, and speaking in a dreary tone, no one without a Harvard which the elites control education can make sense out of it, but he tells us everything is going to hell. No kidding, but I think he fails to account for this problem precisely in the approach that capitalism has taken for the planet, namely that it is expendable and a waste dump. He never once mentions how industrialization has created these problems, he just wants to put mild bandages on them but not eradicate the whole oppressive system. Its obvious he was spoiled, sent to the schools for elites and has the same basic temperament for politics as any other back stabbing, inconsistent dullard in Washington. Whoever made this propaganda, as it is in no way different than what the Republicans have conceived, had only goals in mind that were directed by capitalistic impulse. That is to say, someone is going to benefit, and it seems the new green politicians who support venture capitalist companies who are buying up hordes of land in an attempt to develop the new Utopian future with new technologies. It is the same old story, Al Gore is a believer in the elitist structure, he actually believes there is a democracy in the US which I find very naive. If we are not paying wages to the oil companies, then we will be paying them to the wind and solar companies.I find the speech at the end quite rancid, along the lines of something GW Bush would have oozed over to the dumb downed masses, Gore speaks about people uniting together to defeat communism in the 1990s, what it had to do with global warming, absolutely nothing but he attempts to get base emotions ruminating in people. With that said, he did not understand that communism never existed in the world, the systems in Europe and USSR were merely a tyrannical form of authoritarianism and capitalism, no less different than what controls the US interests. Social ecology was not even mentioned here, which is really a travesty. If you want to change the world, then one must dispose of those antiquated systems that are based on greed, exploitation and violence.","label":0},{"index":8330,"txt":"Something very strange happens when you talk about Global Warming science goes out the window and belief and consensus becomes the topic of discussion.It is because of that fact that I give a failing mark to Al Gores documentary.Instead of promoting intelligent discussion, he kept the debate at the level of belief and consensus.Of course, when you are trying to sell the world into spending trillions of dollars to stop Global Warming you may thing it is a problem to tell the scientific truth we do not know how much of the current warming was caused by humans. Maybe none of it, maybe some of it, or maybe it has overceded the next Ice Age and we got really lucky not to have boiled the planet.But the fact remains that we do not know.so we are asked to believe in the consensus. Never mind that any scientist that strays from the consensus is ostracized. Never mind that scientific inquiry is about straying from the consensus. Einstein did not believe in the consensus, neither did Copernicus or Galileo.So why so much scorn placed on those very researchers who would advance the field by asking the tough questions? If Global Warming is so incontrovertible, surely a few people testing that theory cannot be so threatening.What is going on here? That is the movie I was hoping Al Gore would have made.

Thumbs up on the former and triple thumbs down on the latter. I am not sure if the film is intended to promote dialogue or to spread fear and propaganda.I thought the acting was mediocre.

Maybe. I just finished playing the PS2 version and it is pretty much a complete mess.There are a couple elements that are okay or promising. I will mention those first because it will be over quickly. First, the idea of a historical GTAlike game is a great one. The game Gun was a historical GTAlike game and unlike Mafia, Gun was excellent. I would love to see a game set during Mafias era done right. Next, the storyline is well written. The story makes sense, it has dramatic arcs, it uses an unusual device with much of the game being a backstory and it is interesting. Finally, some of the graphicsespecially those used during cutscenesare impressive. Mafias designers seemed to focus on getting the graphics right in the places where GTA skimped on that effort, especially the characters. Unfortunately in many other areas, the graphics kinda stink, and I would much rather have excellent gameplay than impressivelooking characters.The gameplay is what sinks this title so low. First off, the controls and camera absolutely suck. That has to be the first focus of any game developers. You cannot release a game where the controls andor camera suck. Number one, there is no reason that the players character, Tom, cannot have his full range of motion controlled by the left analog stick. Unless it is absolutely necessary, and it hardly ever is, I hate the setup where the left stick moves the character in a strafing way and the character can only turn using the right analog stick. Here, it is not only unnecessary, it makes most of the simplest actions a challenge. For example, Tom has to climb on a couple missions. But the game is designed so poorly that you have to frustratingly keep manipulating both the right analog stick and the camera, and then press L1 every time you need to climb, or Tom will descend instead.Next, I have never seen a worse fighting system. The first problem is that you cannot autoaim or lock on to any targets. At one early point, the game seems to tell you that you can use L2 or R2 to lock on to targets, but that never worked. So to focus on any enemy, you have to struggle with the stupid right analog stick and try to keep adjusting both the characters orientation and the camera, which tends to drift to the wrong angle or make Tom disappear all the time. By that time, you are probably getting pummeled or shot to death.Next, if you are touching or almost touching an enemyand that is certainly going to be the case for hand to hand combat or when using melee weapons, the fighting systemwhich primarily consists of tapping or holding R1, is completely useless. Enemies can pummel you almost in a bear hug, but you just cannot move unless you back off. So close fighting tends to consist of you yanking on the left analog stick, yelling at the character to move away, which it will not do 50 of the time, then tapping R1 as much as you can before the enemy gets too close again and makes R1 useless. And if the enemy changes their angle to you in the meantime, you are also going to struggle with the right analog stick to get your character oriented in the right way and to get the camera in position so you can see anything. By that time, you are probably getting pummeled or shot again, and your only option will be to try to move the character away again. My fights often consisted of making Tom run circles around an area like a comedy film, hoping that I could gain enough time to struggle with the analog stick and get a couple shots in before being at the AIs mercy again. So much for realistic fighting.And the same problems and more exist when trying to fight with guns. If you are touching someone, half the time the controller just will not allow you to fire off a shot, yet they can still riddle you full of holes. Additionally, there is no autoaim, and the aiming system is ridiculously sensitive, even with the sensitivity set to zero under Options. Gunfights tend to consist of you hopelessly trying to aim or move away while the enemy puts shot after shot into you. Luckily or not, damage seems to be recorded almost randomly. It can take one to ten shots or more to incapacitate any character, and there is no rhyme or reason to it. You can put five shots into an enemys head and near point blank range and they will still return fire and hurt you. Yet, the game designers seemed to care enough about realism than they built a recoil into your aiming system, so after shots with powerful enough guns, your aim will float off target, and you will have to fight with it again.As for the celebrated graphics, except for the characters and textures that you are close to, they are actually pretty disappointing. The distance always seems mostly empty, and there are often expanses of flat colors and textures nearby when you are driving. The city was not very well designed. It is not varied enough, and there are not many interesting things to see or do. The cars seem slow and they are difficult to control. They also all drive about the same. Some have mentioned the music, but that was also pretty nondescript. A much better job could have been done on that end. Also, as many others have mentioned, the load times are ridiculous and constant. They tend to be over a minute long, and they occur between and in the middle of everythingeven races.Overall, the Mafia port to PS2, at least, seems to have been very rushed. The game feels and plays like an incomplete hack job.","label":0},{"index":8343,"txt":"With all the excessive violence in this film, it could have been NC17. But the gore could have been pg13 and there were quite a lot of swears when the mum had the original jackass badhairdewed boy friend. There was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch, then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow, there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people. The violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this. ALmost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off, but the teacher who called him white trash and hoodlum though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum, not even close, i know hoods and am part hood, they do not draw in class, they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher. The teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters, but was just stabbed in the back. There were two suspenseful scenes in the film, but did not last long enough to be scary at all. As i said, the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off. If the gore was actually fun to see, then it would have been nc17. Two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields, they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was, they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines. His stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way maggots were in his stomach, though i would have liked to see that. The acting was pathetic, characters were losers, and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts. I suggest renting this movie for the death scenes, i wont see it again anytime soon, but i enjoyed the excessive violence.

This should be one of the worst things ever made, but for one thing. One element of shear brilliance that makes Nightmare Weekend stand above all others. And that special quality is the presence of George.George is the lovable interface device between the scientists daughter, Jessica, and the home computer security system. With his green hair and nose, balding scalp, and heartshaped mouth, George is the guardian angelconfidant to Jessica, who asks him for advice on how to meet guys in one of the most dramatic pieces of dialogue ever captured on celluloid. With his monotone synthesized voice, George tells Jessica what percentages of males prefer women in white dresses, and also that hitchhiking is the third best way to meet guys after discos and bars. Of course, little Jessica just cannot seem to stay out of trouble, causing George to execute Emergency Program Code Protection Jessica, which results in the violent death of Jessicas wouldbe assailant via one of the aforementioned steel balls.Kubrick was an utter fool for thinking he could give a computer personality using closeups of a red light.

Or seeing a woman walking down a street looking cold and intense and awfully alert? Yeah. Imagine stretching that image to a whole movie, you pretty much got the idea of Broken, though there is no detectives in this movie, I am just using it as a visual example. But, the intense looking woman is here and she filled pretty much 99 of the screen time. I got nothing to complain about that woman, she is a perfect choice for this role.I consider myself a very open minded individual who can find enjoyment out of all kinds of artistic expressions and I can truly enjoy some really moody stuff. It would be really cool if I can frame one of the scene from this movie and hang it on the wall. Let us be honest here, the acting is superb. Some of the expressions on the actors face are what keep me watching.Now onto the problem of this movie. Beyond the mood, there is not much anything else here. The director basically took an obsession of an idea and ran it far beyond what it was worth. I do not consider it to be a spoiler if I say the obsession is mirror. Let us face it, this singular idea is all over the bloody place and that is all the director got to work with. Granted, there are a few twist and turn here and there. If you paid any attention, nothing is going to surprise you in the end, obvious plot holes aside.Now, I am not picking bones with this style of art since I enjoyed them most of the time. I still believe that we should judge an art base on the medium it uses to express whatever the artists want to express. Movie is not a piece of music, or a picture, or a painting, or even a poem, and certainly not just a cool image in your mind. It is all that plus a good story and character development. I consider the Lynch style of movie making cheating. It is irresponsible and cheap and a waste of the medium. We gave movies 2 hours running film time for a good reason. Therefore, we should judge it differently than judging a single frame of imagery such as a photograph or a painting.This movie is not completely Lynch style, thank goodness. It has a linear development and eventually came to a conclusion. It does not have much story or character development. It presented itself rather seriously with characters composed of common folks, thus distance itself from other fantasy stuff at least from the surface. It does not offer any explanation of the fantasy element nor did it ever attempt to build a coherent world around it. The oddity came from nowhere and seems rather isolated and accidental. Maybe the coherency remains in directors head but from what I can see he did not put much effort into realizing it on the screen.Where did he put his effort in then? It seems that he spent a lot of effort in building the mood and enhancing it with the music. The music often built up tension which eventually turn into a tease. Only in the later part of the movie the scare and tension materialized.In the end, I felt like OK, I know what you are trying to say here but is that the point you are trying to make by spending two hours building up all these tension? It is rather irrelevant with who the characters are and what kind of life they have. And we are given very little about who the characters are. All we have is this circumstance that just took placed. Disappointing but I guess the director did not have much material to work with and it shows.","label":0},{"index":8367,"txt":"I give this movie 3 out of 10 because I have watched zillions of movies and I can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mindteasing message should look like. Definitely, The Broken is not one of those movies. I have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations I have read in prior comments, they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people. the photo on the cover clearly shows that the Broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain. It is a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be deformed and lifeless. So, you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before. Though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue. Had the clues been planted more in the movie, one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed. But though the movie was so slow in pace, it was at the same time so empty with no metaphorical scenes at all. And the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil Gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments. Furthermore, if Gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end, then how come she is the evil one? I bet I can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion This movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time. Obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all. I am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies. Horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages! They are supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest, I guess. Horror movies should have blood, screams, intensity, skeletons, body organs and parts. Because that is the real horror and it is never away from reality. I have watched almost all horror movies and I can prove that each one of them can be as real as the sunrising. Nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of. For instance, the horror movie Train with all the slashing and tensity of it and its similarity almost in everything with Hostel, it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs illegally by abducting people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them.And even if we considered the Broken a movie that has an existential message, it is still very poorly presented and the least scary. I prefer the addiction message presented in Requiem for a Dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex, TV, safetybeing pampered, etc... can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me. And those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial, are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply do not like this genre but this does not mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils, ecstasy, leadership lessons believe it or not!, entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life, as ugly and scary as it may seems, Death!","label":0},{"index":8368,"txt":"If the myth regarding broken mirrors would be accurate, everybody involved in this production would now face approximately 170 years of bad luck, because there are a lot of mirrors falling to little pieces here. If only the script was as shattering as the glass, then The Broken would have been a brilliant film. Now it is sadly just an overlong, derivative and dull movie with only just a handful of remarkable ideas and memorable sequences. Sean Ellis made a very stylish and elegantly photographed movie, but the story is lackluster and the total absence of logic and explanation is really frustrating. I got into a discussion with a friend regarding the basic concept and meaning of the film. He thinks Ellis found inspiration in an old legend claiming that spotting your doppelganger is a foreboding of how you are going to die. Interesting theory, but I am not familiar with this legend and could not find anything on the Internet about this, neither. Personally, I just think The Broken is yet another umpteenth variation on the theme of Invasion of the Body Snatchers but without the alien interference. The Broken centers on the American McVey family living in London, and particularly Gina. When a mirror spontaneously breaks during a birthday celebration, this triggers a whole series of mysterious and seemingly supernatural events. Gina spots herself driving by in a car and follows her mirror image to an apartment building. Whilst driving home in a state of mental confusion, she causes a terrible car accident and ends up in the hospital. When dismissed, Gina feels like her whole surrounding is changing. She does not recognize her own boyfriend anymore and uncanny fragments of the accident keep flashing before her eyes. Does she suffer from mental traumas invoked by the accident or is there really a supernatural conspiracy happening all around her? Writerdirector Sean Ellis definitely invokes feelings of curiosity and suspense in his script, but unfortunately he fails to properly elaborate them. The Broken is a truly atmospheric and stylish effort, but only after just half an hour of film, you come to the painful conclusion it shall just remain a beautiful but empty package. There is a frustratingly high amount of fake suspense in this film. This means building up tension, through ominous music and eerie camera angels, when absolutely nothing has even happened so far. By the time the actually mysteriousness kicks in, these tricks do not have any scary effect on you anymore. Some of my fellow reviewers around here compare the film and particularly Sean Ellis style with the repertoires of David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick and even Alfred Hitchcock, but that is way, way \u0085 WAY too much honor.

I knew nothing of it before I entered the dark room, took my seat. I was seduced by the mysterious and suspenseful blurb on the poster I suppose. Also, Lena Headey is nice and unconventionally sexy, and Richard Jenkins is always a reliable guy to have around, so the cast seemed reasonable. It may have been his name above the title that convinced me to go with this instead of whatever else was on. I should have gone to see Valkyrie for the second time instead.The thin plot revolves around Headleys Gina McVey, her boyfriend, her father, her sister and her sisters husband who for some reason are being stalked, in a very louche and unenthusiastic manner, by their evil doppelgangers who emerge from mirrors that mysteriously smash. There could be a great film behind this idea not exactly an original idea, mind you, but still... and in fact, if the filmmakers had shorn away all the supporting cast and simply stuck to Headeys characters story, The Broken could have made a reasonable 20minute short. As it is, it is desperately unmotivated and boring, and terribly inconsistent.For instance, in one scene, a mirror smashes on its own in a room housing all the main characters; they look puzzled but quickly forget about it. In another scene, a mirror smashes in an empty room, and a doppelganger is visible as she steps out of the shards left hanging on the wall. So why did the first mirror smash if no creepy crawly was to come crawling out? Just for a little thrill? There are far too many scenes of the characters in the dimlylit London flats, peering around corners cos they thought they heard something, but seeing nothing there and moving on. We begin to wonder, why does not this malevolent doppelgang actually ever want to try to scare them? Scare the characters and you have a chance of scaring the audience. But we, the audience, will need to start threatening each other, in the darkness of the theater, if we want to have any thrills during The Broken. By the way, once we have spent time with these evil doubles, we are totally bemused as to why anyone should be expected to be frightened of them  they just stand around, blank looks on their faces, perhaps totally harmless after killing their others.There are some nice moods and touches throughout, and I dare say director Sean Ellis could fashion a genuinely stylish and suspenseful mystery movie if he was to hire an imaginative screenwriter next time.","label":0},{"index":8373,"txt":"I read about this movie in a magazine and I was intrigued.

Unfortunately, this is virtually the only thing going for it.The premise is not that bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland did much better in Mirrors. A cross between Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Mirrors, and a rather mediocre one at that. A more suited title would be The Boring, since it draws out every single scene for bloody ages. Or maybe The Confusing since it does not explain anything at all, not in the narrative nor in the story itself, only some vague idea about evil copies and somesuch, dotted with cheap scares and scenes used to death, but nothing tangible. It is just messed up.On the other hand, the acting and the special effects are quite good, but then again, it is not a difficult role to act.After watching the movie twice, I still feel unsatisfied, a little confused maybe, and not in the E.

Rod Serling did a much better job of creating an effective spooky tale in 24 minutes than Sean Ellis did in 88 minutes with this tedious snooze. A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained ending, but in a feature film, there should be a bit more substance and the story should make sense. Sadly, substance and sense are two things missing from The Broken. Yes, it has some moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. Some further observations although this is clearly a contemporary story, not one character in the movie has a cellphone! And even though a car accident is the event that gets the story going, there is never any reference to an insurance company, to the person who was driving the other car, or to the police who would have been required to do a report.

And as bad as those old movies were, this is actually worse. And it almost smacks of false advertising to headline Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. It turns out they had very minor roles. I have to believe those two fine actors were embarrassed to be associated with this film. I am done.

The only one even mediocre is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he could not make up for all the actors including the one playing him as a young man absolutely atrocious acting. Granted the script was terribly clich\u00e9, but even then you have got to get some decent actors! I would not recommend this to anybody because it is so poorly done in every category.

Proud happened to be one of them. The initial idea of telling of the story of a primarily black crewed ship during WWII had some merit. However in less than 10 minutes of watching the movie you find out that the primary point of the movie was to tell about racial tension in WWII. The underlying story is about the ship, the crew and their exploits in the war. This primary point is hammered at you to the point of excessiveness all throughout the movie. I commend the men that served on the USS Mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and for the hardships that they endured. A movie should have been made focusing on the accomplishments these men did for themselves, the Navy and for their country and not making a movie whose focus is racism during WWII.","label":0},{"index":8396,"txt":"I will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about, to prevent it from happening again.

Look up the technical specs on DE 529, or any Everts class Destroyer Escort, and you will see what I mean. I now its black history month in the US, and Im going to be called a racist just for saying this, but the history of this ship is not that great. They did some escort work, chased a submarine that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed. Sorry, but black people did a lot more in WWII then this silly movie gives them credit for.

I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together. This could have been a great movie, the story for many of us outside of the US was new, unique and also interesting. The sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together.

There are inherent constrictions in a Bmovie Budgets are tight, Time is precious Scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days and the actors are often green and inexperienced. The one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you. Scarecrows script seems to have been written in a drunken haze. I could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie, but I will just mention one The Gravedigger. The character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie. He seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie. He is shown with his daughter, who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie. The gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count. Why give the Gravedigger a daughter? Why give the daughter a boyfriend? Why introduce them so late in the movie? Why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline? Scarecrow does not seem to care.The story of Scarecrow goes something like this Lester is a high school kid played by and actor whod I would peg to be in his early 30s who is picked on by the other kids. He is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named Judy. His mom is a lush and the town whore. One of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings by calling him a faggot for drawing birds instead of monsters and cowboys. If you have a high school student still drawing cowboys I would think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws crows and later, kills Lester, in a cornfield, under the titular scarecrow. Magically, Lesters soul goes into the scarecrow. Somehow, this transference changes Lesters soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast I know some reviews have called the scarecrow a KungFu scarecrow. I disagree. The scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie. The scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him, those who smoke pot in the corn field, those who dig graves, boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers, pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set.The bonus feature on the DVD should be mentioned. The director a Frenchman does an impromptu version of rap music, admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by and I am paraphrasing Life ez a bitch, but et has a great assNumber of Beers I drank while watching this movie 5 Did it help No Number of Beers needed to enjoy this movie Whatever it takes to get to blackout drunk level.","label":0},{"index":8400,"txt":"I watched this movie last night and was a bit disappointed.

The British film industry is obsessed with the idea of broken Britain. Trainspotting, This is England, Kidulthood, Football Factory, Kes and From London to Brighton.Bullet Boy is just another British movie added to that list. The main character expresses a desire to go straight yet he still insists on hanging around with dead beats who carry guns and fight with gang members over nothing. I was never convinced that he did want to go straight as there was nothing stopping him pursuing an education or a trade. In fact it would have been a breath of fresh air if he had of gone straight and we had a character who turned his life around. Instead he spends his time helping his friend trying to commit murder. I felt no sympathy when he is predictably shot by another teen at the end of the film, which is sad because at the beginning of the film I really liked the entire family and their desire for success. I believe the makers missed a great chance to show the world that success belongs to those who are willing to really strive for it like the Pursuit of Happiness. I know the purpose of this film was to try and paint a realistic picture of what life is like for black teens living in working class areas of Britain but do not we already have enough films in the UK with that very same plot? Is not it time these talented producers and writers give Britains youth something to aspire to and show them a better life is just around the corner?I applaud the makers of Bullet Boy for not loading the film full of mindless violence in order to try and get success through shock factors like Kidulthood, Football Factory but at the same time this movie offers nothing new to a long list of British films that are effectively dull and depressing to watch.

I agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film an authenticity that has been missed in other British films of late, but my concern is that this film predictably ends sadly.The film intelligently deals with the escalating problem of black on black violence that is sadly all to common in London, but I am concerned that film makers now use typecasting in plot as opposed to characters which is equally as damaging.

They never did. And liberalism continues to slip further and further into political oblivion.This film deals with a little league baseball star who decides to stop playing ball as a protest to the existence of nuclear weapons. The boy is understandably ridiculed until a bevy of professional athletes, led by former NBA star Alex English, join his cause. Not just a few of them join the cause. By the time his movement reaches its zenith, entire leagues of professional and college sports have to cancel their seasons since nobody will play any more. Just to move this review along, I am prepared to grant them this premise. Even though it would never happen in a million years, I will just imagine it could, then go from there.I do not quite remember how, but some type of agreement is reached, and the boy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly sappy and ridiculous scene.Before criticizing the message of this film, let me just say that this film is poorly written, acted and directed. Even if one does agree with the boys stance, it would be impossible to overcome how badly the film was constructed. And that is a shame since there are plenty of good actors that go to waste. Peck, Curtis, Petersen. Alex English does as well as he could have with his character however, and I wish he would try to act in more films. Alas, it is likely much easier to find work in the coaching world of the NBA. One wishes Mr. English would teach more of these thuggish NBA types of today how to shoot the rock a little better. Alex certainly knew how to put the ball through the hoop.As far as the films message in concerned, it is just wrongheaded. Plain and simple. All of those nuclear warheads tucked away in those missile silos out west PREVENTED WAR!!!!! It would be one thing for this boy and his flock to protest an actual war or the USE of nuclear weapons. These weapons were in fact never used, and that was the genius behind their existence. Neither side during the cold war was crazy enough to fire a single missile. Without these weapons, who knows what might have happened between the USA and USSR.The makers of this film obviously intended for kids in America to take up their cause and follow in Chucks footsteps. Kids in America however are more intelligent than the left wing kooks who created this dreck.

But there is a disproportionate number of voters who gave it a 1010, probably due to the message of the movie  nuclear weapons are the bane of mankind. Chuck Murdock is an allstar little league pitcher who gives up baseball because there are nuclear weapons.

Soon all sports leagues from the professional level to college to high school to little league dismantle in a worldwide protest. Later all the children of the world go on a silence strike. This inspires the President of the United States to meet with the Soviet Premier, who in time agree to eliminate all nuclear weapons in time for the start of the next Little League season.

The trouble is that the technical quality sets, lighting, sound, editing, you name it is so Godawful, the movie is intolerable. Some outfit called PKO Productions gets the producing credit, but it does not look produced at all; it looks more like Mike stole one of the cameras from the SNL set and made the whole thing in an afternoon. I realize Mikes goal was to torture the audience, but even that deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to actually see, hear or comprehend whatever it is that is supposed to be shocking. Still, the DVD is not a total waste it includes a eulogy for ODonoghue by Bill Murray and three Mr. Mikes Least Loved Bedtime Stories from SNL.

Not quite so tired and so unfunny, his films are usually witty and hilarious but how did this happen, is it still our good old Woody? The plot runs around four friends who are having dinner together. Two are play writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of hers. It is about a young woman who bursts in on a dinner party unexpected. We never hear the rest because the two play writes start to debate whether it would make a better comedy or tragedy. Than we begin to see the two points of view. Both center on this woman named Melinda who is having trouble both with drugs and with her exhusband. In the tragedy she is an old family friend who after attempting suicide decided to show up at her old best friends front door for no apparent reason. The comedy is about Melida who stumbles in on the dinner party after popping 28 sleeping pills. Both go on a wild whirl wind of events that never really make sense or fit together, or make you laugh more than once or twice.

They camt stop it from sinking farther down than most of the other films this year.","label":0},{"index":8443,"txt":"Well I am probably about to be lambasted by everyone on this site, but The Good Earth is one of the worst structured films I have seen in a long time. We have a 2 and a half hour film that feels like its three and a half because it has two films in one. The first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of drought and famine. They have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind. Conveniently they happen to find a bag of jewels and at the same time they find out that the drought has ended. Yeah OK. With this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again. Well that takes about an hour and a half of film and while its incredibly lifeless at this point it does have a nice arc to it. You would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film. However, the film then continues on for a whole other hour. And in this remaining time, its takes a simple story about a family dealing with the hardships of the world and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lovers. Oh yea and the age old, money is the root of all evil blah blah blah. Just because you know your making an epic film does not mean that your story can go on needlessly for more than it has to. Also the main idea I would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together. Then why do we spend an hour telling a story about a rich man falling in love with another woman, and why is the final moment of the film dedicated to a wife that our main character has not even cared about through most of the film. Oh wait and the film is not the only thing thats poorly written, the main characters wife makes absolutely no sense. She complains a lot about how she was a slave and she never wants to have a slave and yadda yadda yadda. Then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery. Even if they are starving at the time of this idea, it still does not make sense when 20 minutes later in the film she is complaining about not wanting a slave again. There are other films from the thirties that should be paid attention to. The only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography. The land is shot beautifully, oh and the sequence with the locusts is quite impressive. Too bad that were in a film that had nothing to say. One last thing. I know that at this point in time Hollywood was focused mostly on stars and they figured that a good actor can portray anything. For most of the film Paul Muni does portray an Asian man to the best of his ability, but once it hits the half point where the film goes on for no reason he loses it and just becomes regular old Italian Paul, they even cut his hair so he looks like Tony from Scarfacealso a better film than this. Of all the main characters in the film I think maybe three are actually Asian, the rest are just Americans being silly. Oh and please Ms. Rainer that was a really nice one note performance, not, if i could i rip the Oscar out of your hands, oh i would. The Good Earth is one epic waste of time.

And so when I was invited to see the new Woody Allen movie Melinda and Melinda, which I was not even aware had been released yet, I went along happily. I had not really heard much about it so I hoped I would be pleasantly surprised.What I got was definitely the worst Woody Allen movie I have seen. The premise is overexplained, the cast is terrible, the script is slow and lifeless. Too many scenes said nothing and yet were stretched out, I assume to fill out what would have otherwise become a 15 minute short film.I do not mind the concept behind this film  two directors discuss how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and obviously the film proceeds to show us that, by playing out both scenarios. The problem is neither of these two films are any good at all. The comedy is not funny and the tragedy is not very tragic. It seems like Allen came up with a good idea but then ran out of steam, or time, to actually complete the film.The general level of acting is notably bad also  Will Ferrell is the only one who brings anything to the table, and it is basically a Woody Allen impression. Previously good actors like Chloe Sevigny just come off as annoying, and the worst of the bunch is Radha Mitchell as Melinda which is a shame, because her character is in nearly every scene!.To be fair to the actors, the script they are working with is lacking if not nonexistent.

However, what we have is two totally different stories and two totally different women, both of whom happen to be played by Radha Mitchell.The two playwrights in the opening scene  the comedian and the tragedian  supposedly take the same premise and go from there, but the two stories are only tenuously related.

They also share the same curious condition of being able to afford multimillion dollar Manhattan apartments that appear to have been designed by professional decorators regardless of their financial situation or what they do for a living.The only character who exists outside of this dull mindset is Will Ferrel as the obligatory Woody Allen surrogate. Although he does not simply come off as merely doing a Woody Allen impression like Kenneth Branagh in the godawful Celebrity, Ferrel lacks the charm or charisma that the real Woody had when he was playing the part himself in his best movies.The end result is another in a string of self indulgent bores from a oncegreat filmmaker who has been trading in on his former reputation for years.","label":0},{"index":8449,"txt":"I could not wait to see this movie.

To help settle the argument, one man relates the beginning of a story and asks the two other men arguing one a comic playwright, the other a dramatic playwright whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy. The two men then continue the story and the movie plays out the stories that they weave. Now, when I first heard about this film, my understanding was that they tell the exact same story, the genre comedy or drama only changes by how you look at it. Now that would have been interesting. However, the stories only share one main element and a few side elements. They are entirely different stories with major plot differences. The drama is so stiffly scripted and pretentious that it can only really work as selfparody. If this was the point, then it failed because these elements prevent the audience from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters. The comedy is the story that has moments of success, but they are still short and fleeting. Will Farrell is obviously meant to be the standin for Woody, but he could have played this character so much more believably without adding Woodys stutters and handticks. Woody is the best at being Woody. When someone else tries, they are not playing a character, they are modeling a recognizable actor. This type of thing only pulls the audience out of the story.My favorite Woody Allen movies make me leave the theater a little bit lighter in spirit than I walked in. This one made me wish I could get my money back.","label":0},{"index":8454,"txt":"Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role required no. She did not say much and looked pale throughout the film. Luises character was a slave then given away to marriage to Paul Munis character he did a fantastic job for his performance. Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. This seems like something that Hollywood does often. Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban. I felt Luises performance to be lackluster throughout, and when she died, she did not change in expression from any previous scenes. She stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I suppose I did not see it.","label":0},{"index":8455,"txt":"May I please have my 13.00 back?

However, it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that is not going to go anywhere. Clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more, but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it is also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a rogue; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. That is basically all the plot that this movie has. The film does have a real seventies style to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well. It sometimes seems like directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to put across some sort of point, although whatever that point is does not come across very well. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she is definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. Overall, The Rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, but unfortunately it does not have much else to offer.","label":0},{"index":8458,"txt":"I have not yet seen anyone slate this film and i think i may be the first.It was awful.

A good wife, many children and land are the best things for men to have. They are seen as property and investment. Because it is a big budget movie, in which many extras cooperate, big sets are built and special effects take place, the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors. Luise Rainer won an Academy Award for this performance, which is definitely the worst in the movie. Her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience. OLan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with. On the other hand Paul Muni gives a better performance, showing his talent ones again.

Now, you know a movies in trouble when part of the set furnishings manages to attract your attention.I admit, I paid 30 for the DVD just so I could see Faye Dunaway in a contemporary horror movie. I know what you are thinking30 bucks right down into a gaping black hole. And you would be absolutely correct. This movie sucks. There, it is right out in the open. I was expecting some actual scares, and I waited and waited and waited. None came. The raven probably a crow in makeup did not scare me, seeing small pieces of internal organs did not scare me, and even Faye did not scare me. I am not that brave, I know, so it must be the movie itself that is the trouble. What is more, Jennifer was not scared either. Her internal organs were literally falling apart and she seemed more peeved than anything. Her life was rapidly coming to a close and she is worried about attaining more money. Honey, you cannot take money where you are going!!! I need money, she continually says, completely ignoring the fact that her lungs have collapsed and ceased to function.Meanwhile, I spent the whole blasted movie wondering what was up with the grandmother Faye. I was suspicious at first, Faye playing a grandmother and all, and I was still suspicious at the end. There is another relative living in the house that Jennifer and Mary Ellen the GrandmotherFromHell are forced to share temporarily, and I am guessing she is of the same generation as said grandmother. Heres the weird partthe relative looks like she is just endured her eight hundredth birthday party. Mary Ellen looks like she is just gotten a facelift from a renowned surgeon. Facelifts cannot work miracles, but I think Fayes appearance is important to the ricepaper plot. SPOILER!!! It seems that the family is plagued by an illness that affects bad acting...sorry, my little joke. Seriously though, there is all illness that causes their organs to fail and ultimately disintegrate. Yuck, huh? Interestingly enough, Mary Ellen is still alive and all her organs are intact. How did she avoid the Family Curse? Somethings up with her, obviously.Another reason for mourning the loss of my thirty dollarsthis movie features one of my alltime movie pet peeves. I refer to the double ending. This movie ends twice. I absolutely hate it when that happens, and in this movie it feels like the director shot the ending, did not like it, and forget to remove it during editing. I guess it is supposed to be scary, but it is only if you are a film editor.There is one perk to this debacle, though, and it is one of the reasons I bought the DVD.

Gina Phillips is actually good, but it is hard playing across from a mystified Dunaway playing Lady Macbeth lost in the Marxs Brothers Duck Soup. Ah, the Raven...now there is an actor.

The script by Vega, Par\u00e9s  P.J. Pettiette is pretty slow going  tedious which is not what anyone wants, I mean I am sure most people do not want to sit down  be bored out of their skulls. The characters are all uninteresting  fairly faceless with little or no motivation for anything they do. For instance who is that graveyard caretaker guy? How did he know about the demons? What is his interest  motivation for getting involved? I could not see it. Jennifer herself is a pretty unlikable  bland leading lady, her Grandmother Mary Allen is as clich\u00e9d as they come  it is surprising that she is so obviously the villain. I mean for this sort of mystery based horrorghost story it is surprisingly predictable  routine. There are gaps in both logic  the story which together with the terrible twist ending which is not much of a twist I did not like Jennifers Shadow one iota.Directors Vega  Par\u00e9s goes down the much used route of bleaching almost all of the colour from the picture which often renders it not too far from black and white, I suspect that they wanted to give it a period Gothic feel but it is been done so many times before  often so much better that it did not do much for me at all  just makes the whole film look dull  lifeless. There is a definite 40s period look as well, from the costumes to the interior of the large house but again it is rather half hearted  cheap looking. Jennifers Shadow is well made but it is rather forgettable, it is not scary or creepy  it is rather predictable. If that was not enough there is no gore either, there is a few scenes of Ravens pecking away at people  a beating heart but nothing else.With a supposed budget of about 1,000,000  retitled to The Chronicles of the Raven for it is US  international DVD release this is reasonably well made but a million will not buy you too much these days  Jennifers Shadow pretty much proves that theory. There are too many scenes of actors speaking in thick Argentinian accents as well, even though it might be realistic I actually like to be able to understand what people are saying. The acting is alright although Dunaway overacts badly  is obviously there for the money.Jennifers Shadow is a rubbishy ghost film that I thought was a total bore from start to finish, I would rather watch The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became MixedUp Zombies!!? 1964 again instead.

Rather than being exploitation or demeaning, these films actually provide a priceless insight into an era. Well, not Bucktown.In this story, Duke returns to Bucktown to operate the night club left to him by his recently deceased brother. He quickly learns that the city is entirely controlled by a corrupt police force, bleeding protection money out of all the local businesses. Duke resists, and determines that he will rescue the city from the corrupt police. Unfortunately, he does so by calling in a posse of his friends these people are vaguely explained as some former blackmilitants who have worked with Duke on jobs in the past and they simply murder the entire police department in cold blood. And literally in the presence of hundreds of witnesses who do nothing to stop it. Ignorance is not a justification for murder, and it would have been much more entertaining to see the Cracker Police suffer for their actions as opposed to merely getting whacked in the street. While revenge is a ubiquitous and generally satisfying theme in films of this genre, it is a far cry from seeing Pam Grier track down the thugs who offed her family, cuss them out, give them a jujitsu asskickin and set their fro on fire. That has art and a reason for existing and merits a level of respect that is quite undeserved by simply shooting someone in the back. Of course, in this bizarre tale, she is playing a woman completely under The Mans thumb, afraid of the Crackers who run her town and oppress her people. Indeed, her advice to Duke is, Run, man, they gonna kill you!Following the sickening and gratuitous violence, we are expected to believe that the towns mayor wholeheartedly condones the actions of Duke and his friends, congratulating them and offering to throw a parade in their honor, as opposed to, say, calling the district attorney to press capital murder charges against them and have them taken into custody. Dukes posse declines the parade and instead opts to fill the numerous vacancies on the police force created by their recent killing spree. They immediately prove to be even more corrupt than their Cracker Police predecessors to quote the mayor, They are ten times worse than what we had before!. Now Duke finds he must again rescue the citizens of Bucktown from corrupt, protectionracket law enforcement officials and again make it safe for decent folk to operate a prostitution business in the streets. Unfortunately, Duke has already lost all moral high ground and sympathy due a hero, as he was a willing participant in the murder of the original police force. I would not have cared one way or the other if he had rescued Bucktown or gotten plugged himself at this point. I suppose we are to be entertained by the clever way Duke has to outsmart the new Police Goons, but in reality the film has now just become an opera of gratuitous violence, Duke murders all of his former friends and allies in cold blood with the same absence of compassion he had when gunning down the Cracker Police. Duke is a pig.Finally, when everyone in town but Duke, Aretha, and the employees of the local brothel are dead and bleedin in the street, our hero and heroine walk off into the night as though they had some admirable qualities or redeeming values; they do not. Duke is merely a murderous thug and Aretha his enabling misogynist accomplice. If you are interested in this genre of film, by all means, I highly recommend them, see Coffy, Foxy Brown, Truck Turner, Blacula, Sheba Baby\u0085but if in the process you should run across this DVD, throw it as far away as you possibly can! Drop it like it is hot! It should be treated as one would treat a glowing puddle of nuclear waste!

Twenty minuets into a films and I am praying for an ending. Sure some of the visuals were nice, but cmon guys, I mean really! And for a movie about a guy tuning magical instruments there really was not much music to speak of. The music there was was annoying, and boring.

I am a fan of animation and love it when it is successfully merged with live action footage. However, the animation in this film was about all I enjoyed. Although it must be said that the actors performances were excellent. The visual look  including the animation  gave a wonderfully unnerving air to the piece. However this was quality of unease was lost amongst the overblown imagery, both visual and in the script, that you were practically hammered over the head with. Most annoying about this was the relative lack of importance to the plot. It seemed that the plot was shoe horned in at irregular intervals giving a stuttering effect that detracted massively from the flow of the piece. The voice overs from Felisberto  especially the one at the end  very much felt like a desperate attempt to fill in gaping holes in the plot which had been ignored in favour of side issues such as the whole ant thing and even that was not properly addressed. I am afraid the whole piece came across as, at best, a reasonable first attempt, by a teenager who has spent far too much time reading DH Lawrence.

Piano Tuner is, without a doubt, a gorgeous film to look at, and often to listen to. Unfortunately, it is borderline painful to sit through with its convoluted narrative and glacial pace.

As it turns outs, almost everything.Well, not everything. Vincent Price as Rattigan and Henry Mancinis swanky score are the movies two saving graces. Price is wickedly enjoyable, and Mancini more professional than the material deserves. They bring class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity. Meanwhile the rest of the movie, while filled with inappropriately adult situations, still suffers from a completely dull script, blandly generic voice work, terrible songs, and lazy animation that would not have been out of place on any of Disneys mid1980s Saturday morning TV shows.This was a complete disappointment to me. It is amazing that this movie was nearly contemporary with The Secret of NIMH.

The scenes of early 70s Manhattan look very good, as does the lead actress. It is a very crisp black and white, which could almost make the movie feel undated and fresh. However, some of the other techniques the filmmakers employ shoot that prospect all to hell. The disjointed editing is VERY late60s, somewhere between surrealism and new wave. The story also feels like it came from a very specific time, somewhere between free love idealism and artsy experimentation.The film follows a young girl around the city as she looks for a man who she had anonymous phone sex with. As she meets other odd characters, she reveals her quirks and they reveal theirs. The movie seems to be meant as an offthewall, irreverent comedy, but adds an avantgarde feel. I would expect that if you like Andy Warhol movies, you would be very excited to discover The Telephone Book.Some problems I had Near the end of the movie, one character tells a rambling anecdote that lasts over twelve minutes\u0097brutal to sit through.

It ended up being one of those experiences where I felt like I could have really liked it if it been a little different. But this is what the filmmakers gave us.

They awake the next morning  as Larry attempts to leave the cinema he is attacked  killed by a zombie, the same zombie attacks Regina but she manages to escape where upon she discovers that almost everyone on the entire planet has been turned into red dust. Almost everyone because by some amazing coincidence the only other person to survive happens to be her sister Samantha Kelli Maroney, they desperately search for more survivors  meet up with a long distance trucker named Hector Gomez Robert Beltran. Meanwhile an evil bunch of scientists need human blood to develop a serum to save themselves from turning into dust  they are on the look out for unwilling donors...Written  directed by Thom Eberhardt I found Night of the Comet a pretty rubbish viewing experience, I am surprised at the amount of positive comments on IMDb about it because I just thought it was boring crap that never lived up to it is potential. The script starts off 100 miles an hour with the obliteration of the entire population of Earth  a zombie attack but then it goes absolutely nowhere  then eventually introduces the sinister blood stealing scientists towards the end of the film because by that time the slim story has run it is course. There are plot holes too, if these scientists want blood why shoot the three or four gang members  save the two sisters when the guys would have provided more blood for their experiments, killing them just seemed a totally bizarre  an almost suicidal thing to do considering they need blood to develop a cure, it just does not make sense I mean if your going to die  you need to experiment on human blood would rather have five or six donors providing blood or just two? I am not having the fact that the two sisters survived independently of each other, I mean what are the odds on that? When Hector confronts the female scientist for the first time she never mentions Samantha or where she was or where the underground facility was where they took Regina before she committed suicide so how did Hector know these things? I also thought after the first twenty odd minutes the film slows down to a snails pace  became incredibly boring  dull to watch, after hearing so many good things about it Night of the Comet comes across to me as nothing more than an overrated boring piece of crap.Director Eberhardt does a really good job, I liked the look of the film with it is red tinted sky  he manages to create a really cool atmosphere of isolation. Unfortunately there are far too many shots of empty streets, there are constant montages of empty streets, deserted roads  abandoned buildings  it gets extremely repetitive  dull. OK we get it there is no one else about so there is no need to keep ramming it down our throats by constantly showing roads without cars on them. The zombies are totally wasted, there are two zombie attacks in the entire film  that is two individual zombies as well although there are a couple of effective nightmare scenes. Night of the Comet pays homage, or ripsoff whichever you prefer, several other much better films including the obligatory end of the world shopping spree in a mall lifted from Dawn of the Dead 1978. Forget about any blood or gore as there is not any.Technically Night of the Comet is pretty good, the special effects are decent enough  the production crew were obviously very good at closing streets off. The acting was alright expect for Maroney as Samantha the airhead blonde who became highly irritating.Night of the Comet was a big disappointment for me, I had hoped for so much more. Persoanlly I found this film dull, boring, uneventful  the puke inducing sequence where the sisters go shopping to the tune of Girls Just Wanna Have Fun is probably the worst moment in the film.

I myself, along with everyone else have been duped into believing it is in fact a horror film. On the contrary though, its actually a supernatural thriller. Too bad it is not the least bit thrilling.The Return stars Sarah Michelle Gellar as Joanna Mills, a young woman who has had personal problems since the age of eleven. It was at that age that she began having haunting visions depicting the murder of a woman whom she has never met. While in Texas on a business trip, she is led by these visions to the murdered womans hometown, La Salle. There she comes face to face with another person who has frequently appeared in her visions. A man by the name of Terry Stahl, who is played by Peter OBrien. Joanna is now on a desperate search for answers. A search that could in the end result in her very own murder.I really do not know where to begin here folks. Which should I mention first? The atrocious acting, hideous directing, or the terribly bland story? No matter which one I choose my point behind each is the same they simply suck. Adam Sussmans screenplay is downright moronic. Its not interesting. Its not compelling. Its just plain unpleasant. I kept waiting for something to jumpstart the film I have placed quotations around film because I do not believe The Return deserves to be called an actual film due to it is foulness. and at least give it some slight chance of hope, but nothing ever happened. I was left out in an unbearable cold to freeze. Not even stellar performances from the actors themselves could have saved this disaster. Of course they probably knew this having read the script then agreeing to do the film. I assume this is why the acting was so awful. At least that is what I am choosing to believe. I really hope the cast does not pride themselves on their performances. They need immediate medical attention if they do.Now the directing was unmistakably bad, but I cannot quite crucify Asif Kapadia entirely. Well I could, but I will not since I am such a nice guy. I look at The Return as a test for Kapadia because for all of you that do not know, this is his first fulllength feature film. He is just getting his foot in the door and still learning. Next time around, well if there is a next time, hopefully he will have improved vastly. The only thing he was able to accomplish here was almost completely duplicating the visual style of Marcus Nispels 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Now that is nice the film was given that, but unfortunately he still will not be receiving any kudos from me for that. Copying someone elses work is not something I consider to be praise worthy. Even if it is from a film I very much enjoyed.I think Jim Sonzeros American remake of Pulse will now have to fork over the title of Worst Film of the Year to The Return. It beyond question is deserving of the title in almost every imaginable way. Now I do not doubt this will make a small, and I mean very small, profit. No matter what though, it will not surpass or even parallel the fluke success of Gellars previous acting effort, The Grudge. On that note, there is one last thing I would like to add.

When we came out, we were only slightly more informed on what the plot of the movie actually was. Though not the worst movie I have ever seen, I definitely do not recommend spending your money to see it in theaters. Maybe have a friend rent it for you it is not even worth the rental cost, either if you really want to see it.When a movie is so convoluted that you have no idea what is going on until the last five minutes, there is really not much that can be said in its defense. The acting was decent, more than you would expect to get from this movie, and some of the shots were good, but it was all bogged down by a lame plot and poor script.This movie was actually so bad that as soon as it got out, I went and purchased a ticket to see a good movie just to cleanse my mind.

This film is more like Dark Water, except it is even more predictable and slow moving than it. I was extremely disappointed with this film. It did not scare me nor interest me either. Let us face it , this type of plot has been flogged to death at this stage e.g. the dead trying to contact the living  Dragonfly, What Lies Beneath, Ghost Story, Dark Water, Darkness, The Changeling etc.etc. It seems to me that the only ones writing original horror films nowadays are the Japanese and the Koreans.

Now, every time I see Ron Perlman or Kristy Swanson, I will think of Tinseltown which is a VERY bad thing.I picked this up thinking that it might be something intelligent or at least make me chuckle and with Arye Gross and the aforementioned Swanson and Perlman, I thought that it at least would not be bad. You could tell the movie was made on a budget the size of Wheeling, Indiana Where? Exactly., but maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie. WRONG.This movie is NOT funny or entertaining in any sense of either word. It is just there and lasts for 84 excruciating slow minutes.The characters are paperthin. You almost care about NONE of the characters, and since the leads are two struggling Hollywood writers with a dream that is all the two struggling writers with a dream who wrote this need you to know about them. Okay, the two REAL writers know all about there onscreen versions of themselves, so they figure so does the audience. They do not even think about character development, except for trying to tie there story back to Gilligans Island.The plot is unoriginal. Two guys live in a storage center, where one of them stores a bed, and there are about twenty other people living there, too. The rest of the story is contrived and stupid. Have you seen National Lampoons Favorite Deadly Sins? The second story with Joe Mantegna is about a television writer who cannot find a good story to make a TV movie about, so he creates one. Now substitute the television writer for a screenwriter, morph Mantegna into to annoying actors half his age, and take away the comedy and you have this movie.The actors try. Kristy Swanson is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie. She is still hot, but it would help if she would actually STAR in a movie instead of constantly making CAMEOS.

The premise of two writers, down on their luck, living in a selfstoragespace bin was mildly amusing, but, painfully bland.The introduction of the character, played by Joe Pantoliano  the big deal movie guy, that lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory, offered hope and I decided to give it a few more minutes. And then a few more until Kristy Swansons introduction as a budding film director  borderline nymphomaniac, added a bit of spice. Her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eyecandy inclusion.Ultimately, the obvious lowbudget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes, stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moments. Some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget, Whithnail  I being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream, but down on their luck.However, for my money, the actors save Tinseltown from the Terrible movie archives and just about nudges it into the could have been a cult movie archives. I laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving Joe Pantolianos character. In particular, the penultimate scenes in the terribly clich\u00e9d, but still funny, richbutscrewedup characters house, where the story unravels towards it is final moments.I can see how Tinseltown was a great stage play and while the filmmakers did their best to translate this to celluloid, it simply did not work and while I laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners, I think the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and expectations to such a degree I would have laughed at anything.Unless you are stuck for a novelty coffee coaster, do not pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket.","label":0},{"index":8526,"txt":"A broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent Tom Wood and Arye Gross are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager Ron Perlman whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is terrorizing the city, the Costume Killer so named because, after injecting his victims with Windex, he dresses them in silly costumes.

He seems to find very interesting and varied characters, great personalities to create documentaries for, and then with tongueincheek editing make fun of everything they are about. It is never really a direct caricaturation of them and Morris seems most of the time to be saying, But no, no, these people are really fascinating, really!, but there is always these subtle little canted angles and notsosubtle editing techniques that show that Morris seems to be mocking them behind their back.This movie tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation... a man who studies African hairless molerats to find that they are amazingly antlike, a lion tamer, a man who keeps a garden full of animalshaped shrubbery, and a robot designer. The general theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what designates animal, human, and life features? So the title of Fast, Cheap,  Out of Control does not really seem to mean anything in terms of the movie... right? Except of course Morris seems just a little disturbed by these individuals passions he might call them obsessions making synthetic designs on life. I share not that fear and honestly do not appreciate some of the connections Morris makes in the film.But I stress his subtlety. With no voiceover narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees, it is not as if Morris ever pounds that anxiety onto the spectators collective head. Instead he mixes circus footage and ant footage together often at times when they are taken out of the context of the circus and the ants, showing a sort of collective absurdity behind what all of these people are talking about. I do not find them absurd, I find them all very neat and interesting individuals.Unless, of course, he did not intend such juxtapositions, which means he is just a bad craftsman instead of a silent subverter.

When the Senator was practicing on the ground one day, he succeeded in shooting off the tail of the airplane. He could not have done that if the gun had been properly aligned. The gunnery officer responsible for that admitted, in public, before a camera, that he was responsible  he had made the error, not the Senator. The fact that the film did not report that fact, shows how onesided it is. This film was designed to do one thing, destroy the reputation of a complex person.A much better program was the PBS special done on him. He was a hard working, intelligent, ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages to rise to extraordinary heights.

Boyle as Joe gives a compelling but historically inaccurate portrayal of the Wisconsin Senator, the caricature McCarthy many take as the real one. Meredith, as wily Army lawyer Joseph Welch, who outsmarted McCarthy at the Army hearings in 1954, is very good, as always.In fact, McCarthy and Cohn were quite right in worrying about the appalling security situation in the Army, and the 1954 Army hearings became enmeshed in the smokescreen used by the Army to deflect the investigation away from their security failings, which the committee were investigating, by countercharging that McCarthy and Cohn were trying to get favours for their staffer, David Schine, whilst in the service.The film is self satisfied agenda driven polemic, based in the pervasive myths which have passed for the truth with many people for decadesthat the red scare was essentially phony and McCarthy, HUAC etc were always blasting away at the wrong targets, being no more than lying, career ruining publicity hounds, who were trampling over the constitutional rights of startled innocent liberals, who were accused of being security riskscommunists.People who know little about the matter still feel confident in repeating misinformation on McCarthy and the red scare to this dayClooneys Murrow hagiography is an example. The misinformation is pervasive, no wonder people have swallowed it. A recent obit of Budd Schulberg in the serious left wing UK newspaper The Guardian headlined that the Hollywood writer named names to McCarthy perpetuating the lie that McCarthy investigated Hollywood as head of HUACthe truth being that McCarthy was never even a member of HUAC and he had little interest in the politics of Hollywood typeshis investigations were confined almost exclusively to arms of the US government.The mythology about the red scare being baseless is now completely exploded by recently opened Soviet and US government documents, if anything McCarthy and co underestimated the sheer scale of Soviet and fellow traveller infiltration in the US, but decades of public misinformation about this period will be hard to correct.One day maybe some really brave Hollywood soul will make a movie telling the truth about how many American men and women clandestinely aided the mass murderer Stalin, and worked to impose his vicious system of government on the western world, giving an accurate account maybe of Joe McCarthys careerbut I will not hold my breath.

People who think it is the best movie and people who think it is the worst.Stigmata would not be the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is up there. First of all the sound. The producers spent more time on the soundtrack than the editing. It was so loud when the soundtrack was playing and no one was talking and then when Patrica was talking in her monotone voice, she could hardly be heard.I usually like Patrica and Gaberial, but they were both flat in this movie. Patrica had basically 3 emotions. Quiet, in great pain, or really angry she has stigmata. The first was the predominate one, the second involved screaming pain, the third involving raising her voice. It was loudness that distiguished the three and not emotion.Maybe I missed a lot of the deep meaning and subplots everyone was talking about, or maybe I was distracted by the terrible filming and MTV like style. When you watch a 3 minute video you need fast cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story, in a 2 hour feature film, it is nauseating. I fail to see the meaning of her seeing that women across the steet and dropping a child. And no Pittsburg does not rain that often!!I think maybe a real story, with something to say could have been intended, but all the budget was spent on buying music and the equipment to do slow rain drop shots and renting that gorgous apartment that Ms. Arquett lived in that they ended up firing the guy with the story.","label":0},{"index":8538,"txt":"I find it hard to believe that anyone would put this movie in the same context as the Exorcist.

My interest in this movie was peaked when it was compared to The Exorcist, and my visit to the official web site increased that interest. The web site had many tales of actual stigmata throughout history.

The movie gradually gets more and more quiet and the people mumble and mutter, forcing you to turn up the volume I watched this at home. Then Beavis blasts some really loud sounds with supposedly scaryshocking images, forcing you to quickly lower the volume again. This occurs many times until, mercifully, the movie ends.

Partly, because it takes itself so seriously, as opposed to regular light hearted trash, this movies wants you to be emotionally involved, to feel for the characters, and to care about the alleged conspiracy. None of this ever even comes close to happening.MILD SPOILERSThere are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible 1. Incoherent and totally nonsensical plot. 2. Annoying styleoversubstance MTV camerawork. 3. Moronic characters and plot holes.Allow me to elaborate.1. Apparently, when this movies was being made, they could not decide whether to make a movie about church conspiracies, the stigmata, or possession. So, guess what? They combined them! An aetheist gets possessed by a dead person, who then makes her exhibit the stigmata so as to expose a church conspiracy. How a regular person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary is never explained, nor even talked about. Now, instead of just saying what he wants to say, he gives her the Stigmata. WHY? Why not just spit it out? Instead, we get treated to scenes of screaming things in harsh voices, carving cryptic messages on cars, and writing messages on walls. Apparently this priest was also a violent guy, because the possessed young lady also wigs out on one o f the characters, while talking in that cliched, harsh, possessed voice that we all have heard countless times. This also starts to tie into my second complaint, because whenever the young lady gets the stigmata, she also defies the laws of gravity by floating into the air, and tossing everything and everybody around her as if they were in an earthquake? Why does this happen? Who knows!?! My guess is that the director thought it looked cool.2. This movies contains dozens of shots, in slow motion, of course, of birds showing up out of nowhere and flying off, and most annoyingly, of water dripping. This womans apartment is constantly dripping water! CONSTANTLY! Logically, the place would probably fall apart with this many holes. To sum up this complaint, towards the end, and for absolutely no reason, the camera cuts to shots of water dripping, in slow motion, in reverse!! WHY!?! I have no idea! It has no relevance to anything, and once again, I am betting it is because the director thought it looked cool.3. One of the main characters says he became a priest to explain away holes in science. This does not make sense to me. I would think that going to church would be enough, but no, he has to go through the entire rigamarole of becoming a priest. I just do not buy it. Secondly, there are lots of plot holes, a few of which I will elaborate on below. For starters, when she first gets the stigmata, the scene ends with her laying unconscious, bleeding. Next, she is in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? Another one is towards the end, when the previously mentioned scientific priest character is talking to the spirit who is possessing the girl. He says, Take me as your messenger! Not a word for word quote, but you get the idea. His response? You have no faith, only doubt! So, because of this, he possesses an aetheist! An aetheist has no faith, far less then any scientific priest! And then, there is the fact that the object of this movies conspiracy, this Lost Gospel of St. Thomas, I believe is available at local bookstores. The characters are willing to kill to supress this document, but you could walk down to a bookstore and buy it. Maybe this is supposed to take place in an alternate history, where it is not wide known, but the movie never tries to tell us this, or to even hint that this is an alternate happening of that documents uncovering.In closing, this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree. It is my archnemesis, which I feel the need to insult every chance I get. I loathe it. Final Grade F","label":0},{"index":8543,"txt":"I am a big fan of the TV series Largo Winch.

Moore has expertise in distracting the viewer from this focus though, while Greenstreet is obviously less skilled here.Having been privy to all of the issues surrounding Moores speech at UVSC, I was disappointed to see that the major complaints of the community  that Moore was being paid 40,000 of the State of Utah s educational funds to basically promote John Kerrys campaign and to advertise his own liberal movie  were pushed to the background by Greenstreet while lesser issues were sensationalized.The marketing methods for this video have been equally biased and objectionable... promoting the film by claiming that Mormons tried to kill Moore. Not only is this preposterous, but it defames a major religion that Greenstreet obviously has some personal issues with. I followed Moores visit very closely, and all of the major news agencies noted that Moores visit came and went without any credible security problems or incidents in Utah.Greenstreet has banked on this film to jumpstart his filmmaking career to the point that he has even dropped out of film school to help accelerate this. This seems to have been a severe miscalculation though, since Moores visits to roughly 60 other colleges and Universities across the country in 2004 diluted interest for this rather common event. Greenstreets assumption that American audiences would be interested in this film due to the promoted religious and conservative angles does not seem to be well founded.Even the name of the film, This Divided State, is somewhat of a misnomer since Utah voted overwhelmingly for Bushs reelection and thus appears to be more politically unified than any other State. The division in the movie title seems more indicative of the gulf that exists in Greenstreets ideological differences with his religion and State. If anything, I find a humorous correlation between the religious angle of this supposed documentary and Woody Allens hilarious contention in Sleeper 1973 that, I was beaten up by Quakers.","label":0},{"index":8547,"txt":"I was one of the few nonliberals who showed up to see Steves video.

Their conversations are held with their fellow students and the college faculty. Steven Greenstreets documentary is a prime example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members.The documentary focused on a small group of individuals who were portrayed as representing large groups of the population. As is usual, the people who scream the most get the most media attention. Other than its misrepresentation of the community in which the film was set, the documentary was well made. My only dispute is that the feelings and uproar depicted in the film were attributed to the entire community rather than the few individuals who expressed them.Naturally it is important to examine a controversy like this and make people aware of the differences that exist between political viewpoints, but it is ridiculous to implicate an entire community of people in the actions of a few radicals.","label":0},{"index":8549,"txt":"When evaluating documentaries that focus a relatively small group of Ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this in the USA you must consider the following. The United States of America with its population of 270 million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to uphold Human Rights that it has its failings and downside. It is of course expected that extreme right wing groups and ultra \u0096conservative groups exist in sizable numbers however relative to the size of its population they are very small and isolated . On a per capita basis Europe, Britain and even Australia have similar right wing groups in fact on a percapta basis the actual size of NeoNazi groups in Australia is actually higher than in the United States of America. It is for the above reasons that it is unjustifiable to demean and vilify the American people and their level of debate in Educated American Society by very fraudulently and deceptively presenting this ultraright wing bunch of psychopaths as being representative of American Society. By doing so Greenstreet, deliberately chose small and isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to construct an image of America that is an outrageous and deliberate sensationalist lie. This film is clearly designed to inflame and pander to the views of people who harbor this subconscious and morbid hate the American people and way of life under the guise of spurist fashionable and clich\u00e9 idealist left wing ideology. This film was made for profit not for furthering the truth about American Society and the Human condition. Greenstreet can make documentaries that focus on ultra right wing conspiracies, the Military Industrial complex but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate let alone alternative solutions to the failings of a vibrant democracy.

Fortunately, the cinema refunded the ticket and I went to see Buffy the Vampire Slayer instead a minor improvement. That film is Gone With the Wind compared to Dick, a comedy so unfunny that it nearly became the second film I ever walked out of. Dick was so unfunny it was even impossible to laugh AT it, let alone laugh with it.Granted, paying to see a movie with a title like Dick suggests that it will be filled with inane dick jokes and wind up a huge letdown, and yet I had high hopes because of the notable cast Daniel Hedaya, Bruce McCullough, Dave Foley, Kristen Dunst, etc., etc. and a premise that at least promised something fresh. What the film delivered was, as portended, four woefully predictable dick jokes, comic timing suffering from jetlag, and a premise that wore thin after the first five minutes. In short, it was the Watergate scene from Forrest Gump stretchednay, laid on a rack and mangledover 90 excruciating minutes.As soon as you understand that the two main charactersairless, insipid squealers who gasp and roll eyeballs incessantlywill participate in every major Watergate event, you begin to mentally check off the plot as it progresses 18 and a half minutes erased from the Nixon tapes, CHECK; the Deep Throat meetings with Woodward and Bernstein, CHECK; John Dean getting a change of heart and testifying, CHECK. The process drags out more languidly and about as engaging as the real Watergate affair with about as much laughgetting to boot. And though it posits to be an amusing redeconstruction of the events leading to President Nixons resignation, it turns into a paintbythenumbers, chooseyourownadventure, fillintheblanks comedy that says very little and entertains even less.Even the films strong pointthe aforementioned castis bewilderingly unproductive here. The most disappointing of all is Harry Shearer as G. Gordon Liddy. Trapped as he is behind the thick Liddy moustache and straitjacketed in this numbingly morose screenplay, Shearer mumbles a few lines, tries desperately to leer from behind the prosthetic nose and eyebrows, then disappears. Dave Foley, one of the comic masterminds from Kids in the Hall two others, Bruce McCullough and Mark McKinney also appear in this filmah, the blessings of nepotism fares badly as well. His H.R. Haldeman occasionally lends a muchneed lightening of the funeral plot, but the funniest thing about him is the buzzcut he sportsperhaps the films funniest bit of all. And then there is Daniel Hedaya as Richard Nixonoops, I mean Dick. Ha ha how amusingly funny. He manages to play a solid Nixon, avoiding the pitfalls such as overdone make up, rubbery nose and false teeth a la Anthony Hopkins while preserving the essence the vacillations between human tenderness and coarseness.

But the clothes and the music wind up being an ersatz substitute for true characterization and plot, a kind of extraplot shorthand that the producers hope will compensate for anemic writing.The only possible use for this film is years down the road when any one of its talented cast appears on David Letterman or Conan OBrien.

Prom night, a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable, turns into hell!! However, I saw it and was extremely disappointed. It was not only the worst horror movie I have ever seen, but it was one of the worst movie in general that I have ever seen!! First of all, it was not even scary. There was not one moment in that movie when I jumped out of my seat. Also, the murder scenes were so cheesy and dull. All the slasher did was either stab his victims in the stomach multiple times or cut their throats. Also there was absolutely no gore its rated PG13. The scene with the most blood was probably the one where the killer murders the black girl. He slits her throat and blood splatters on the sheets hanging around them they do not actually show him cutting her throat.Next, you see the killers face the first time he is introduced in the movie. He is not mysterious, creepy, or scary. He is just this guy who kills people.Also, everything in the movie was so clich\u00e9. An example is when, at the end, the killer is about to kill the main character and at the last moment, the detective shoots and kills him. Also, every single thing in this movie was so predictable. The victim, after seeing the guy with a knife, runs for her life, hides, thinks she gets away, and then the killer just pops out and kills her.Finally, the sequence of the movie was extremely bad. The guy goes into the hotel, kills a few people, the bodies are discovered, someone pulls the fire alarm, and everyone evacuates. The main character forgets something in her room, has an encounter with the killer, runs and escapes. Thats it! She and her boyfriend go home, the slasher kills the guards patrolling the house, finds the girl, then gets killed by the detective. The movie sequence was so stupid and clich\u00e9.If your thinking of seeing this movie all because the preview looked good, trust me, do not waste your time or money.

Brandos acting is the ONLY thing that makes this movie watchable. The plot is inane and laughable not comic. The other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they portray some modicum of humanity... these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard. Everything about the technical side of this film is either mediocre or just plain awful. The director throws freezeframe and slowmotion shots about with impunity. The incidental music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effect. It is not something I really look for in a movie, but even the wardrobe was way off. The venerable Brando could not take focus away from the awful rags they had him decked out in. I have heard this movie called David Lynchesquire and irreverently funny... it is neither.

His performance as The Swede is the worst of his career, and that is precisely what he intended it to be. He does not overact. Instead, he simply acts in a bizarre fashion and pokes fun at his embarrassingly gargantuan girth. The scene where Brando climbs over the toilet stall is probably the worst, funniest moment in the history of cinema. As we witness him fall headfirst into a toilet, it is hard to believe that we are watching the same actor who starred in A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, and The Godfather.I guess the real question is why Marlon behaved like this in his later years. Was he sick of the movie business? Did he just like making a complete and utter fool out of himself? I guess we will never know. But this film serves as a fascinating study as to what bad acting is all about.On that note, watch fellow acting veteran Donald Sutherland as he struggles to deliver his lines, embarrassed at himself for agreeing to participate in this travesty.","label":0},{"index":8573,"txt":"I still cannot believe this movie.

Not what his fans ought to remember him by.Brando in his last years is looking more like Orson Welles and Free Money is the kind of film Welles would have done looking for financing of his own work. Brando is the warden of a local prison which in America, when it is located in a small rural setting is usually the largest employer in the area. That gives one who is in charge a lot of clout. Unfortunately he has one weakness he indulges, his two twin bimbos otherwise known as daughters. Even when they get simultaneously pregnant by a pair of losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden Church, their hearts still belong to Daddy.Not to fear because Brandos willing to give them jobs in the prison where they work under conditions not much better than the convicts have. What to do, but commit a robbery of a train which goes through the locality every so often carrying used money to be burned by the Treasury. Although Free Money has some moments of humor, for most of the time it is quite beneath the talents of all those involved. Some of them would include Donald Sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and Mira Sorvino as his stepdaughter, but also straight arrow FBI agent.Of course these people and the rest of the cast got to work with someone who many rate as the greatest American actor of the last century.

I am sorry to say, however, that Disney completely messed up when they made this sequel. I will admit it has some good points to it. The songs are not bad, and the animation is clean and clear. There is some humor, I am sureI do not remember, because after watching it I immediately banned it from appearing before my eyes again. The worst point of this movie is the plot. In this movie, Ariel becomes her father. She forbids her daughter to go near the sea yes, out of fear, just as she was forbidden to go near the land. I personally think that, given her past, Ariel would maintain some of her headstrong ways and not treat her daughter like she herself was treated.Besides this fact, Ursula was replaced by a nonscary, pathetic sort of sea witch the underfed, forgotten sister who is more comical than scary. She, too, has some little underling to do her biddingbut she is not scarier or worse than Ursula. Ursula spoiled us with her believability for badness. This sea witch is a joke.To make matters worse, Flounder is a fat, deepvoiced father no longer the cute guppy we all know and love and Erics voice is not even done by the same actor something that always annoys me in a remakesequel. His voice difference was very obvious to me, by the way! I felt that the only reason this movie was made was so that Disney could catch a few fast dollars, something I hate to think about a corporation I actually really do enjoy. I felt that this plot lacked imagination. I know that this act child following in the footsteps of a parent happens, but Ariel was different. That was what we loved so much about her. She had a dream, she fell in love, and she made that dream come true. Until she appeared in this movie, that is. Then she became just like the other adults. This is not the Ariel I know. And I do not like her.I know of some children who have enjoyed this film, and I know some adults who did not mind it, either. But for me, and for all of you out there who have the utmost love for Ariel, please do not see this movie.

However, it is not a bad film.It starts when Ariel has just given birth to a beautiful child, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana Eurselas sister, so they build a large wall around their house which lies on the sea. As Melody grows up she begins to wonder outside of the walls where she is forbidden to go.

I was horribly disappointed.The storyline was, basically, the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody who is not satisfied with life on land. She wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect herand when Melody finds out she is upset and angry. And she then decides to run away, and she becomes a mermaid. So she is happy swimming around, and Ariel sets out to find heras a mermaid.The story does not sound too bad written down, but the clich\u00e9s and repeats of situations from the first movie are just too obvious. And adding the fact that Melody is, overall, extremely annoying, and the movie becomes almost unbearable.There is also a whole load of other new charactersTip and Dash being two of them. They are not too bad as characters in themselvesjust try not to think of Timon or Pumbaa! The songs leave a lot to be desired too, they just do not have the same magical energy as the songs from the original did. The animation obviously did not have a whole load of work put into it eitherin parts it is jumpy, and not much imagination is used for the characters movements.Another piece of advicetry to forget about Ariels original character while watching this movie. The beautiful, rebellious, curious teenager has all grown up into a bland, boring wife and mother, and her trademark red hair is all tied up. This is much better viewed if you have never seen the originalyou will have nothing to compare it to.However, all in all, it could have been worseit is not as bad as certain other sequels, such as Cinderella II.

Having loved the original Little Mermaid, and having been obsessed with mermaids as a child could be, I decided I would take the time to sit down and watch the sequel.Disney, I have got a little message for you. If you do not have the original director and actors handy...you are just looking to get your butt whooped.In the sequel, our story begins with a slightly older Ariel and her daughter, Melody. My first big issue was that Eric and the rest of the crew sang. Yes, I understand that Disney is big on singanddance numbers, but really, that is what made Eric my favorite prince. He was calm, collected, and a genuine gentleman that knew how to have fun. And he DID. NOT. SING.And then there is the villain. Oh, how could we forget the shivers that coursed down our spines whenever Ursula slunk onto the screen, terrifying both Ariel and audiences around the world? Unfortunately, that gene was not passed on to her seemingly useless sister, Morgana. Nothing was ever, EVER said about Morgana in the first movie; she just pops out of nowhere, trying to steal the baby. Oh, how cute. The younger sister is ticked off and instead of going after the trident, decides to kidnap a monthold baby. Gag me.Other than being a flat character with no sense of originality in her, Morgana was just very unorthodox. The same plan as her sister, the same minions who, by the way, did not scare anyone. I had a three year old on my lap when I watched this movie, and she laughed hysterically. She had no purpose being in there; I would like to have seen Mom be the villain. I am sure she would have done a better job than Little Miss Tish over there.King Triton held none of the respect he would earned from me in the first movie, and do not even get me started on Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder. Triton was a stern but loving father in the first movie, and in the second, it is almost like he is lost his will to knock fear into the hearts of his subjects. Scuttle, once a comic relief that made everyone laugh with his dinglehopper yes, I will admit it; I did call my fork a dinglehopper from time to time after that. In this film, Scuttles all but forgotten. A supporting character even in the first, he at least added something to the movie. He was rich with a flavor the others did not have, and in the sequel, they all but stripped it from him entirely. Sebastian was still the same, but twice as worrisome as before. Disney, do not do that. Do not even try to mess with our favorite crab. Or our favorite little fat fish, who becomes a dad and has a multitude of very annoying children. He is fat, and he is bland, and he looks like he is going to flat line any second.The walrus and penguin were unneeded, and after a while, you just start to resent everyone.

Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King...even Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

I know the songs, I love the characters and I love the story. I cannot say anything like that about The Little Mermaid II Return to the Sea. It was terrible. Let us start with the story. The plot was a reversed copy of the first movie. Same situations, except in reverse! Ariel wanted to live on land, her daughter Melody creative name wants to live in the sea. Ariel was tricked by Ursula, Melody is tricked by Ursulas sister, Morgana. Ursula had a sister?? Not sure where that came from. Besides being a strange copy of the first movie, this movies plot seemed tired and was uninteresting compared to the first movie. Now the characters 1. Ariel What happened to her??!! No longer the spunky, headstrong teenager we all knew and loved from the first movie, she has now grown up and her personality went down the drain. Her singing voice was not as strong either, due to either Jodi Benson being a lot older, or the songs being so terrible that her talent was wasted. 2. Prince Eric While he did not have a lot of personality in the first movie, like all Disney princes, somehow his new voice and his very few lines made him even more robotic. To top it off, he just cannot seem to defend himself, and Ariel becomes the tough one of the two. 3. Sebastian Say goodbye to the lovable crustacean from the first movie, because a whiny, aggravating little crab just took his place. He also had no good songs in this movie. You can almost forget the glory he earned from singing the incredible Under the Sea and Kiss the Girl from the first movie, and it is very sad. 4. Flounder They destroyed him!! He is not cute anymore, his voice is terrible, and he has kids now?? Who is the mother??? 5. Morgana She appears to be Ursulas sister out for revenge against her mother, who always picked Ursula over her. So she plans to get King Tritons trident to become the new ruler of the sea. Sound familiar? Anyway, she is a very clich\u00e9 villain and falls short of Ursulas greatness as a villain. She epically fails at witchcraft, she is not very tough, and not threatening at all. 6.Melody Ariel and Erics daughter. Ironic name because she, unlike Ariel, cannot sing. Her voice is annoying, her friends a walrus and a penguin?? Really?! are not funny or likable, and she is exactly the same as Ariel, in reverse and not as likable. Skip this one.

I mean, everything is redone from the Little Mermaid. The worst part of it is Morgana Ursulas crazy sister who appears out of nowhere and threatens Melody, which is ridiculous since Triton is there with his magic trident. Why did not Triton do anything about it? Because the plot required him to do nothing. I could go on, but I will not. The whole thing is a shameless attempt to rake in more money from the Little Mermaid, and was obviously thrown together without any thought, because they knew it would sell.

He believed in AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER being the end of it. But this one...REALLY ticked the taco. There were so many ripoffs of other Disney films in this, it was not funny. Quick summary, if you do not already know... Melody, the daughter of Ariel and Prince Eric, is born. Ursulas sister, Morganna who basically looks like Ursula, if she were to dye herself green and go on the Ally Macbeal starvation diet shows up and, after trying to do the newborn tyke in, and failing, prophesizes doom for the characters. After that ordeal, Ariel goes into a lapse of being like her father, and refuses to tell Melody about her mermaid heritage, and later on, forbids her to go near the sea. Well surprise surprise. Melody finds out, being the stubborn brat she is, and runs away, then makes a deal with Morgana to become a mermaid, in exchange for something. Gee does THAT sound familiar? She becomes one, but in her half of the bargain, has to retrieve her granddaddys Trident and bring it back to the sea witch. While doing THIS, she runs into a couple of outcast animals, a penguin and a walrus named Timon and Pumbhuh? wait...no! that is not Timon and Pumbaa! or is it? Could of fooled me.

In contrast, the Little Mermaid 2 is targeted primarily at young children, because it is spontaneous, reflects a childs self perspective, the music is bouncier and less dramatic, and the ending feels like recess.The Little Mermaid 2 starts out when baby Melody is presented to Ariels side of the family. Abruptly without any visual cues to aid the drama, a giant tentacle grabs the baby. I laughed, wait a minute it is not funny, the babys being attacked! Okay, I will stop laughing. Morganas crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity, takes away potential drama since it happened so quickly.Throughout the feature, Melody seems superhuman, which I defend is how most children envision themselves. This quality in Melodys character is clearly brought out toward the end when she fights Morgana without an inch of fear on her face.Like the first movie, Melody has a lot of Ariels problems, except the reverse. Queen Ariel turns out to be like her father by restricting her from the ocean, whereas King Triton restricted Ariel from the surface. Ariel and Melody both rebel against their parent.The music is more emotionally moving in the first. This sequel has a bunch of songs, but not as much orchestral work went into it. It is great for little ones, because it does not take an orchestra to impress them.The ending in the first movie was strong and uplifting. The sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone playing in the water. It is definitely more targeted at kids, because instead of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away, this ending leaves you thinking, It is time for recess!

SPOILERS It is much similar to the original. Melody, Ariels new daughter is threatened by Ursulas sister, Morgana. Morgana escapes, but keeps her promise to take Melody away from them. Did Ursula have a sister?! And she is not that great a villain as Ursula was. This is where there is similarity. Medoly is kept from the sea until Morgana is captured, but she does not know a thing about it, because it all happened when she was a baby. A wall surrounds the palace to keep her in and morgana out. She goes under the wall day to day to have a swim and talk with Sebastian, who is not as funny or fun as in the original. She finds a seashell with her name on it and runs away from home and to look for answers and finds Morgana. Here is a similarity; Morgana tricks Melody, making her happy by turning here into a mermaid. Meanwhile, Eric, Melody and King Triton look for her. To stay a mermaid she needs to steal the trident from Triton. So Melody does, because she does not know King Triton is her father. She makes friends with a penguin and a walrus and here is where it is awful. The penguins who live with them in an icy ocean, hate them because they are cowards. So they try to prove they are heroes and fail. That does not suit the little mermaid. And the dialogue during those conversations between the penguins and those two characters is earbleeding. you know why? Because the first had a great story. This one is not and is not magical. It is just an example of how bad many sequels are.Melody finds them and they help to take her to Atlantica to prove themselves. When they take the trident, Ariel finds Melody with Morgana. Melody is angry at her mother for keeping her from the sea so she gives the trident to Morgana, then she shows her true colours once she grabs it. Poor Ariel and Melody are in her custody. The penguin and the walrus begin to prove themselves when they fight Morganas shark friend. Sorry I did not mention him earlier. They finally prove themselves. Eric, King Triton and his soldiers arrive but are forced to bow down before Morgana by the power of the trident. Melody takes it, throws it to Triton and he ices Morgana literally. Then Ariel apologises to Melody and thinks it is all her fault. It was not! Ariel did the right thing to protect Melody, but they never say so. Triton offers Melody to live in sea or land. She in fact has a better idea. She uses the trident to vaporize the wall so humans and merfolk can be together. Then everyone sings an awful song. THE END.Whoever has seen it and likes this obviously has not seen the original. I do not dislike this because I am a teenager. I liked it when I was very very little. Then as I grew older I began to see what is bad about this film. young, young kids will enjoy it, but it is likely that when they are in primary school, they will forget about it. Normally I would think I overjudged a film and it was better than I remember when I watched it again, but not this one. It is even worse. Story is no exception. If you thought, by reading this that the story is good, read more of this comment and you will know the other bad points Well, you know the story now. I am sorry for spoiling it for you, but I had to point out some bad parts of it. One of the worst things is the animation. Colour is awful. The original had beautiful colour. Watching this almost made me want to go blind. Even the illustrations and landscape design were not good. The original had beautiful, magical colouring and beautiful underwater landscape design and for land as well, making it a joy to watch.The music is unbearable. Compared to the first, the music here is crap. Songs are not that well composed and Tara Strong I think that is her name who did Melody can not sing. She at times either sang too high or did not keep track for the melody in the song. So much for having Melody as a name.And the music is not at all beautiful or moving. Little Mermaid 1 won an Oscar for it and it truly deserved it. This one deserved a razzie award for worst musical score in a sequel if it would exist.I did not like the voices. Several people who played characters from the first, did the same ones in this. Jodi Benson is a great singer, but now that she is older, no offence to her, her voice is too deep and not so beautiful anymore. And I am really disappointed in her and others who were in the first for being a part of this. If I was chosen for this film, just by reading the script, I can tell it would be a bad film. The characters are different now. Ariel is more wiser now, but annoying. They overdid her character, making her too mature. In sequels you are not meant to change the characters unless it is for a special reason. She was sixteen in the first. There is little chance she changes. That is the stage when you become the person you are going to be for the rest of your life. Screenwriters should think of that. They should think of the character.Well, I suppose that is it for me. I hope you find my comment useful, because I am sure a lot of you will agree with my point of view.","label":0},{"index":8593,"txt":"This movie makes me want to throw up every time I see it. If you take the first movie, and reverse the plot ariel wants to leave the sea, her daughter wants to go to the sea, take the same characters and give them new animals and new names, and then throw in crappy animation and the biggest suck factor, possible, you get the little mermaid 2. Its basically a copy of the first movie with a reversed plot. I will take you through the horror of it step by step. These are the people from the 1st movie First of all, Prince Eric is still prince eric, with about 3 lines in the whole movie. Ariel is uptight, annoying, and is not the carefree, headstrong spirit we saw in the 1st. In fact, she is the exact opposite. Sebastian is still sebastian only less cute, less convincing as being stressed out, and the jokes just are not funny anymore. Flounder has about 2 lines. He now has kids and he talks with a dumb nasal voice. Scuttle is still dumb scuttle only not funny. King Tritons character is probably the best, he still retains the intimidation and love for his daughter, Melody. Ariel and Prince Eric appear not to give a hoot about their daughter. Like i said, all they did was use the characters from the first movie and copy them. This is what they did Ursula The new evil villain is Morgana, Ursulas sister who feels like she always lived in Ursulas shadow. I would not be scared of her if she showed up at my doorway with a knife. She cannot do anything right and she is a failure as a villain. She has the same voice ursula did. Sebastian  Flounder  Have been replaced by probably the most stupid sidekicks, Tip  Dash, a walrus and a penguin. They try to be heros but always fail when trying. the plot is so predictable. They become heroes at the end. Yawn. Flatson Jetsom Now replaced by a shark who was turned about 10x smaller by triton. Hes really bad too. Morgana and the shark sharkbait, I think was his name have no chemistry, good or bad. ArielAh, Ariel. Our lovely mermaid was replaced by her unlovely daughter, melody. Melody cannot sing, her voice is about 2 octaves higher than it should be, and you want to punch her in the face because shes so fake sugary sweet. She wants to go to the sea, she is clumsy and the kids make fun of her, she has to go find herself. yawn.Not only is the movie boring and unoriginal its so simplistic when you watch this movie you will gasp at how bad it is. Certain parts of the movie make you want to call Disney up and demand why such a horrible movie was made as a sequel to such a wonderful original.Basically, comparing the little mermaid 2 to the little mermaid is like comparing and Ed Wood movie to Casablanca. Do not ever watch this, not even when your bored.","label":0},{"index":8594,"txt":"If there is one thing you can count on Disney to do, it is their uncanny ability to take a story and tell it again and again and again. Even watching the commercial for Lady and the Tramp II was a horrible experience. Disneys going to ruin one of their most awesome classics ever. It even had that spaghetti meatball scene. It is been done before! And that is what I say to this sorry direct to videothe entire concept should be banned. Everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of Bluths really bad movies. The penguin and walrus duoI have even forgotten their names are just a really poor carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is another Ursula. She even repeats practically all her old lines. The songs are pathetic, really abysmal. I have never heard songs so bad from them before until now. And the dialogue is atrocious. It is pathetic and simplistic. On the plus side, at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent. All of the usual characters are not as annoying as they used to beor maybe that is a minus for Little Mermaid fans. Back on the negative, Melody is just so sickeningly cute you just might vomit. I almost did. Do yourself and your Little Mermaid fan a favor. Do not waste your money on this. True, it is not as horrific as Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but that is little consolation.","label":0},{"index":8595,"txt":"Well then, thank you SO MUCH Disney for DESTROYING the fond memories I USED to have of my FORMER favorite movie. I was about 5 when the original movie came out, and it was one of the first movies I remember seeing. So, now that I am 16, and feeling masochistic enough, I decided to rent this movie. Thus, I managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this sorry excuse for a movie. This movie takes everything that made the original endearing and wrecks it, right down to the last detail.In this movie, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, Melody, and go to show her to everyone in the ocean...BROADWAY STYLE! After the musical number ends, within minutes, the sea witch Morgana shows up and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does not give up the trident. Thus, he gives it up without even a fight. Eric stands there gaping, though Ariel figures out how to use a sword and save Melody. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should never go near the sea until Morgana is caught.Well...uh, nothing of note really happens. Eric is a total wuss. He never really manages to do anything. Ariel sort of does something. Melody manages to screw things up. Plus, the animation is a new lowpoint for Disney. The computer graphics wind up clashing with the backgrounds. Ever single opportunity for character development is wasted. The songs bite.Look, do not waste your time. I am pretty sure even the little kids are going to be bored out of their skulls with this, since nothing even remotely exciting ever happens. They will not want to sing the songs.

And so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some headpeckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule lives.There really is no excuse for Prom Night. There is less than nothing original about it and I truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on IMDb. The only part of my viewing that I enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of ghosts. It was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them.The plot was basically some guy going on a rampage. And the thing was, it was not even a slightly exciting rampage. Maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame Robbie Williams lookalike with a baseball cap, I might have sat there feeling slightly anxious. The fact that I cared less about the characters than I did about the colour of the cinema carpet did not really add to the effect, either. And to make matters worse, the rest of the characters were equally onedimensional and oblivious. The hotel staff did not seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave. I was incredibly surprised that the bitchy, stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was. She realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs, entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets. Nice one.The worst thing was, I hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest. He really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening. Shocking! And the music, do not even get me started. It was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral.I really wish that Prom Night was a joke. It was terrible and stupidly predictable. No one, in their right mind or otherwise, has any reason to see this film. Mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation. If you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film, hear my plea. Do not do it. There are better things to spend six pounds on.

Fear and loathing in Las Vegas comes to mind when I think of that. Well not anymore...from here on out, whenever someone asks me, hey, what is the most unusual movie you have ever seen? Slipstream is what i will say! And I do not mean unusual in a good way.From the very beginning of the movie, it was obvious that this was going to be one of those trippy camera effect movies. By that I mean, little things like flashing images on the screen, rewinding and fastforwarding peoples words and scenes, messing with the color on the screen, flash forwards and flash backs constantly...then you have the actual acting itself. People randomly get violent, shoot thingspeople, say the weirdest things that just do not make much, if any sense.The movie is about a writer who starts to intermingle real life with the book he is writing and for a lack of a better way to explain it, you basically see this trip he goes on throughout the movie. The thing is, Johnny Depp went on a similar trip in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but the only difference is that his trip was entertaining to watch, not painful! Honestly, I had a real hard time even finishing Slipstream. It kind of hurt my brain a bit.I can see some film buff making a claim as to this movie having certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique but add to the feeling of dementia...blah, blah, blah. Point is, this movie hurts your brain when you watch it....it makes very little sense, it takes all of your concentration to even remotely try and understand what is going on and even at the end, the only thing you can be happy about is that it is over...and you can say you actually sat through it! So in closing, if you want to see a movie that will have you saying what the heck over and over again both out loud and in your head, go ahead and waste an hour and 30 minutes and check this out.Mr Hopkins, while I applaud you as an actor and commend your choice to take a stab at directing....please, do not ever make a movie like this again.

I have to say it felt a LOT longer than its 96 minute runtime, and not in a good way. In the end I was looking for closure, some measure of satisfaction but it did not turn out to be the clever or ingenious piece I had hoped it would be. I think Tony mistakenly thought what he did do at the end of the film gave us that... but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with the illconceived conclusion.

Anthony Hopkins, however, decided to make possibly the strangest movie anyone has ever seen. Slipstream is a movie that is so strange that even David Lynch would probably look at the person next to him and say What is going on?.This is a movie where, in one scene, a man crosses the road towards a yellow car facing to the right which suddenly changes into a pink car facing to the left. This is a movie where two characters have a conversation interspersed with shots of random people laughing and insects climbing up walls. This is a movie where a man starts talking about Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers only for the actor of that particular movie to suddenly show up as himself and then disappear into thin air. This is a movie that decides to throw the need for a coherent plot straight out of the window and use fifteen different edits whilst doing so, as well as changing from black and white to colour for seemingly no reason at all.I must, however, commend Mr Hopkins for his choice of actors in this movie some of whom portray multiple characters. All of those involved throw themselves into their roles, even if they probably have no idea what they are actually doing. My favourite here was Christian Slaters thug in a hat who was impressively menacing whilst babbling nonsense and singing the American national anthem. Anthony Hopkins has been quoted saying that he did this movie as a joke and that is possibly the best way to sum up Slipstream. It is a joke on the audience. You will watch it from beginning to end, trying to understand what is going on and hoping that the answer will come, only to discover that the answer never actually does. What the punchline to this particular joke is, only Anthony Hopkins will ever know.I mentioned David Lynch earlier and I am a big fan of that particular director. I would guess that Anthony Hopkins shares my love for the likes of Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet and Lost Highway. However, Slipstream is not as satisfying as any of the movies of Lynch despite imitating many of his techniques although I was surprised to discover that nobody talks backwards in Slipstream. It is far too chaotic and random  as another reviewer here pointed out, it is the movie version of Alzheimers disease. No doubt there are a small number out there who are able to watch this and draw something from it.

However, perhaps therein lies the problem. His movie has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously complex and drawn from very deep within, but it is so impersonal. There are no characters. We never know who anyone is, thus there is no investment on our part.It could be about a screenwriter intermingle with his own characters. Is it? Maybe. By that I do not mean that Slipstream is ambiguous; I mean that there is no telling. Hopkinss film is an experiment. On the face of it, one could make the case that it is about a wouldbe screenwriter, who at the very moment of his meeting with fate, realizes that life is hit and miss, andor success is blind chance, as he is hurled into a slipstream of collisions between points in time, dreams, thoughts, and reality. Nevertheless, it is so unremittingly cerebral that it leaves no room for any hint of emotion, even to the tiny, quite rudimentary extent of allowing us a connection with its characters.I did not think the nippy and flamboyant school of shaky, machinegunspeed camerawork and editing disengaged me, but reflecting upon the film I am beginning to realize that it had a lot to do with it. There are so many movies of the past decade in which the cuts or camera movement have sound effects as well as other atmospheredeteriorating technical doodads. I suppose in this case it was justified in that its purpose was to compose the impressionistic responsiveness of dreams. However, I knew barely anything about Slipstream when watching it, and I came out the same way. And I just do not care, because Hopkins made no effort to make us care.

Prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch, but for all the wrong reasons.It is a poorly acted, massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do. It is clear Hollywood Horror is dead. Even The likes of The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot. Prom night is virtually bloodless and I am not even going to mention how bad the plot is. Its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm... the original.One of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be. Donna Keppel Brittany Snow has survived a terrible tragedy, but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style.When the big night finally arrives, Donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big highschool blowout by living it up and partying till dawn. But while Donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future, the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance. An obsessed killer is on the loose, and he will slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only Donna.Who will survive to see graduation day, and what will Donna do when she is forced to confront her greatest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davis costar in the slasher remake that will have tuxedoclad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor. A plot that will probably put you off going to see this. Witch if you ask me is a good thing.Without much to work with, McCormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations. At one point, a girl backs into a floor lamp a lamp! and McCormick tries to pump it up into a jumpscare moment. Desperate times really do call for desperate measures. There have not been this many shots of closets since the last IKEA catalogue.In the era of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and To Catch a Predator, there probably is a freaky, scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and societys creepy obsession with youthful beauty. This is not that movie.My final verdict? Avoid at all cost. Nobody will like Prom Night, it is even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hackjob remakes.

My impression is that he started the project semiseriously, then quickly realized that it would be pathetic and not funny unless he made the situations more and more ridiculous. As a result, the whole thing has an uneasy, cheap and insincere feeling about it.As someone smartly pointed out, the film has two of the dates suing and putting restraining orders on Myles and yet they appear in the film, which would be impossible as it would require a consent form. It also appears to me that the majority of women who appear as the dates are professional actresses albiet not famous ones, excepting Tina Carrere  they are simply too obviously pretty, polished, thin and comfortable in front of the camera to be average civilians.Mr. Berkowitz makes a classic error in only casting this kind of very pretty thin actress, instead of utilizing a variety of believable women, which might have made the premise even in a mockumentary more believable and funnier. He also skates over what is probably his realworld problem, and which is that both the movie character and the real world Myles Berkowitz appear to be functionally unemployed his real life IMDb credits are practically nonexistent, excepting this film. Even in the world of the movie, his exwife divorced him for never being employed. I think the viewer let alone Mr. Berkowitzs real life dates are deserving of an explanation of he manages to live in one of the most expensive urban environments in the US, in a luxury apartment, driving a fancy car and eating out at pricey restaurants when he does not seen to have any source of income whatsoever. Is he drug dealer? Living off his rich parents? No clue!You can get away with most anything in a film, if the jokes are really funny. 20 Dates is painfully, embarrassingly UNfunny. Mr. Berkowitzs idea of a joke is to have his character, while on restaurant dates, announce to his companions how the food served is likely to give him either diarrhea or constipation  the WORST kind of childish potty humor.It is not very surprising to discover that Mr. Berkowitz never made a film before 20 Dates and in the last 8 years, has not made a single film, appeared as an actor in anyone elses film OR had a writing or producing credit of any kind. My gut instinct tells me that this film was not financed by Elie the gangster money man who appears offcamera but more likely by Mr. Berkowitzs affluent parents, or perhaps represents a shocking abuse of credit cards.

And it shows through muddled shot compositions especially apparent in group scenes, often unfortunate camera positions, performances of wildly varying quality for the director was apparently so overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the task actors were apparently left to their own devices, awkward voiceovers that sound like radio broadcast announcements.Vidors War and Peace was probably the main reason that prompted the Soviet government to spare no expense on this production. The USSR release of the Vidors picture made quite a splash. Certainly, Bondarchuk wanted to emulate the greatest strength of the Hollywood film and find his own Audrey. His final choice, Lyudmila Savelyeva, a bigeyed sprightly darkhaired thing indeed somewhat resembles Hepburn. Unfortunately she was a Kirov ballet dancer without neither acting experience nor talent, so unsurprisingly the most kind word that I can find to describe her performance is awful.Though it might be expected that Soviet actors, speaking the same language as Tolstoys characters, would have better understanding of them than foreigners but this War and Peace often proves that not to be the case. The revolutionary upheaval swept away the thin upper layer of Russian cultural soil, that the world of War and Peace grown out of, so a good share of these big name Soviet actors involved in this production often look as clueless as Americans performing Shakespeare  I do not mean of course that American actors cannot possibly play Shakespeare credibly, but you will know what I mean if you witnessed American members of the cast in Branaghs adaptations.

I do not know if there have been different releases and updates, but the disks we rented had a 2000 copyright on them, if that means anything.

The levels often yoyoed up and down; when the scene cut to a battlefield panorama, the orchestral track would thunder so loudly that I did not know which would blow out first  my eardrums or my speakers. When it was time for dialog, the volume would usually drop to something barely audible. Occasionally, the orchestra and Foleywork would stay loud while the dialog was superimposed at a much lesser level. My wife and I found that the only way we could watch this movie at all from these DVDs was if one of us kept a hand on the remote to continuously modulate the volume. And, like another user has already commented, when we selected English audio the dialog kept switching back and forth between Russian and English; and occasionally when the characters spoke in French on the native track the dubbing was in Russian, so you are SOL if you understand neither. Ultimately, we gave up watching after the first disk.

But, it is one of the worst film prints I have ever seen transfered to DVD. The picture is muddy and inconsistent, often strobing. It is almost tolerable if you crank your brightness, color and picture levels up to maximum.... but the problem does not end there.The sound is also way inconsistent, blaringly loud in parts, virtually inaudible in others. And as for languages, it is a HUGE problem for English speakers  the dubbed option has some good actors, and some really terrible ones whose performance grates, and parts of the film just are not dubbed at all, slipping back into Russian and even French randomly.The subtitled option is not much better. The subtitles do not appear below the image, but right over it  obscuring some of the beauty or what is left of it in the scenery. Furthermore, the subtitles are often a poor translation a shame given that the script took pains to hew so close to Tolstoys actual words, and the subtitles too seem to just drop out in parts. So, even if you max out the color, brightness and picture settings, and turn the volume way up, and choose subtitled and English dubbed, you are still going to get a film that is annoying to watch and listen to.Can it is content overcome that? It might have been able to, but at seven hours  who can stand it for that long?Maybe someday, someone will come along and restore this  and maybe then I will see a masterpiece  but for now, I just cannot give more than one star to something I have only been able to stand watching about the first 12 of.","label":0},{"index":8637,"txt":"The Angry Red Planet Quickie Review Like The Man From Planet X, this is a bizarre science fiction tale culled from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still damn near the same thing.

Four astronauts take on this journey a military type played by Gerald Mohr, a poor mans Humphrey Bogart who enjoys saying the word Irish and has the acting savvy of a codfish, then there is Naura Hayden, a beautiful redhead and only female crew member on flight with three men wearing the most formfitting suits possible to accentuate all her curves, next, Les Tremaine, a wonderful character actor from cheap scifi films like this as the egghead, and last, Jack Kruschen as Sammy  the guy from Brooklyn with jokes and does not seem too bright although chosen for his expertise in electronics. None of these performers are really any good, and all of them say their dialog with little conviction. Watch Tremaine as he utters that scientific nonsense! Really, the best out of the four is Kruschen  and that really says a lot about this film. But bad acting aside, the movie just falls apart when they land on Mars via flashback. The Angry Red Planet had a real cheap budget because Mars is really the American Southwest with a heavy red tint over it. When the story calls for something that might look Martian, there are drawings placed with a heavy red tint over them. You can tell they are drawings The monsters are perhaps even worse as we get a Batratspider with a size upwards of 40 feet that looks like some kids got together piecing dead animals together. The other significant creature is a giant amoeba with an oscillating eye. Whew! These are bad. There is a nice drawing of a Martian city, but there just was not enough of this in the film. Despite all these big problems, The Angry Red Planet is a fun bad film. It is really fascinating to see how far we have come as a civilization.

Most of the picture is a flashback to what transpired over there. The picture is saddled by inane, melodramatic dialog, typical of many scifi efforts of the fifties  sixties. Note, for example, how the ships commander Mohr tells another crew member to stay there for no reason; as if moving to another spot inside the ship will cause a problem. Later, the commander orders two of the crew to remain in the ship while he and another go outside. The two he ordered to stay say no way and follow out; I did not have high hopes for the expeditions success by this point. There is much talk of ears twitching and hugging a freezeray gun named Cleo short for Cleopatra, of course. It would at least be pretty funny, unintentionally, if the story did not drag.There is a very slow pace to the whole thing; the astronauts spend as much time looking out the ships window portals which change color from red to blue, commenting on what they see, as they do outside actually exploring. The martian landscape, advertised as filmed in Cinemagic, usually resembles animation cutouts, or drawings, shot through an orangered filter to give the illusion of interacting with the actors, who do take on an odd surrealistic appearance due to the process. But I do not think it fools anyone over 10 years old. The one clever mention I did notice was that the memories of the surviving astronaut would be tinged with unreality, so that would explain the unreal nature of the martian vista. Oh, okay...I was amused by some of the astronauts actions as they begin to explore; right off the bat, they test their freeze gun on a plant, killing it, just for the hell of it. Then the female member hacks with a machete at what she thinks is a tree but turns out to be the leg of the spiderrat monster. Nice going, lady. Look up next time. No wonder the intelligence on Mars gets upset and does not mind that one of the lower lifeforms, a giant amoeba, attacks the explorers. The acting is not too impressive. Mohr especially, had a very annoying technique, saying a line and then abruptly erupting into a huge grin which always creeped me out  reminded me of It! the Terror From Beyond Space. The ending is fairly anticlimactic; do not expect any huge revelations beyond the no more expeditions with freeze guns named Cleo.","label":0},{"index":8650,"txt":"This DVD appears to be targetted at someone who will just put it on and play it in an endless loop in the background.

Just like someone who can appreciate different music, painting, or in this case, film  but not necessarily like them  I can appreciate why some people may enjoy this sort of film...I just do not...THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is an exceedingly dull and tedious film about a school for wayward girls.

She has a young son who creeps around and peeps on the girls while they shower in their nightgowns no less ?!?..., and meanwhile, girls are disappearing from the school as they are the victim of a murderer who is lurking about the campus...I can see why THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is often compared to SUSPIRIA which is a masterpiece of a film in my opinion..., in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians  but this film is so dull and uneventful that I could barely stay awake. I am all for tension and suspense in horror films  but this film held neither for me. Luckily, I was not expecting a whole lot going into this one, so I cannot say I was really disappointed  THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED just reinforced the fact that I personally do not typically enjoy most horror films much older than from the 70s. This is not a hard and fast rule, but those that I HAVE enjoyed definitely seem to be more of the exception.

Is she running from some kind of fate too horrible to contemplate, a monster, blackgloved killer, or supernatural evil? No, she is running from a bunch of bullies. For the OTHER 40 minutes that follow, various figures walk around the school in the dark holding candelabras and looking alarmed or distraught, which does not say much in itself perhaps because great movies have been made about just that but if you are going to have characters walking around corridors and staircases you better be Alain Resnais or you better know how to light that staircase in bright apple reds and purples like Mario Bava. We know a killer stalks the perimeters of the school but his body count is pitiful and sparse and in the absence of the visceral horrors one expects to find in the giallo, we get no sense of sinister mysteriesunspeakable secrets festering behind a facade of order and piety and rightness which is the kind of movie La Residencia wants to be but does not quite know how to do it. We know something is off because girls are reported missing but we never get the foreboding mysterious atmosphere that says something is seriously fcking wrong here, man.

I like the first kill, the image of a knife hitting target superimposed over the anguished face of the victim as a lullaby chimes in the background, but the rest is too inconsequential for my taste.

The early life of the daredevil motorcyclist is recounted here in multiple flashbacks. The film opens with a rather silly prologue with Hamilton in his whiteleather, starspangled gear spouting the world according to Knieval as if to say, Do not worry. This film is about my youth, but I will be back in my familiar costume by the end of the picture. Hamilton is preparing for a huge jump, yet is still licking his wounds from the previous one as devoted wife Lyon both supports and derides him. He recalls various vignettes of his childhood and delinquent teenage years along with his early days as a stunt rider and blossoming celebrity. This flipflop approach is pretty abrupt and sometimes disjointed, but it does prevent the movie from sticking to one of its inexpensive sets for too long a time or from getting into a rut with the fairly pedestrian characters. Hamilton, usually a suave and debonair persona, does a very fine job of enacting the tiny details of his subjects mannerisms and demeanor including his walk. His hair is a shade lighter and longer and he works hard to give the right inflections in his speaking. He even pays minor tribute to Knievals many injuries by appearing in a skimpy towel while his shoulders are covered in scars from the multitudinous accidents. Facially, he looks nothing like the real cyclist, but he does suggest him in his physical performance. Lyon is excellent at playing the young girl he loves and then the more worldly wife, though her 3pack a day voice does threaten to give her away at any given moment. She and Hamilton strike up an easy chemistry which goes a long way in putting the film over. Other nice supporting turns are given by Freed as his jaded doctor, Cameron as an early influence and Taylor as a fleabitten sideshow barker. The film was made on a low budget, but the story is a rather low rent one anyway, so that does not affect it too badly. The makers wisely used actual Butte, Montana locations to give the film a proper small town ambiance. Several of Hamiltons antics are amusing, though the character is certainly reckless and inconsiderate of other peoples property! Some of the real Knievals completed and failed stunts are included in some blurry footage, one of which features a mindboggling splatter in which the man is rolled up and snapped around like a rag doll.

Lawrence, where psychobabble reigns supreme, and where no one can get down to living a productive life because everyone is too busy talking about how unproductive their lives are. Spending time with the characters in a D.H. Lawrence novel is like being locked in a closet with a group of your most selfabsorbed acquaintances who you would run away from if you met them at a party. When I read Women in Love, I so desperately wanted to strangle every single character in it, but since I could not, I was hoping they would at least strangle each other. Alas, only one of them dies, not by strangulation, and I will not spoil it for you by telling which one, in case you actually give a damn about this story or any of these people.To give director Ken Russell his due, he makes this filmed version about as entertaining as it is possible to make this essentially unfilmable novel. He throws out much of the psychological mumbojumbo that Lawrence adored, and focuses instead on all of the naughty parts, so we get lots of histrionic lovemaking in beds and fields, two buck naked men wrestling by firelight, and one embarrassing scene featuring Alan Bates yup, buck naked again roaming around in a meadow making love to bushes and grass I am not kidding. Glenda Jackson won an Oscar for her performance as Gudrun, the more dominant of the two sisters at the storys focus, and she certainly tries her hardest to do something with this material; anyone would deserve an Oscar simply for having to bear Russells decision to give her a scene where she has to dance wildly in front of a herd of mystifiedlooking cattle.

This movie takes place in an Oregon town, where Donna Brittany Snow is about to go to her senior prom and let herself have some fun after going through some extremely traumatic events in the past few years. She and her friends arrive at the prom, which is taking place in a grand hotel, and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their lives. Little does anyone know, a man from Donnas past, who has haunted her for years, is also at the prom... and is willing to kill anyone in way of his pursuit of her.I am a fan of the original Prom Night, so I tried to maintain a little hope in this movie, but I have to admit I was quite disappointed. Prom Night suffers from the worst affliction a horror movie could have, and that is predictability. There are absolutely no surprises here, and I felt I had seen everything in this movie done dozens of times, often better, before. What does this equate to for the audience? Boredom. Unless of course you have never seen any horror movies, or are part of the preteen crowd, but the majority of the audience will most likely be able to guess nearly everything that is going to happen. The plot is simplistic, but the entire script is void of any type of surprise, twist, atmosphere, or anything, and this really, really hurts the movie because it never really gives the audience anything to sink their teeth into. It all just seemed very bland.A lot of people seem to complain with the fact that this is a PG13 slasher movie as well, and I understand what they are saying, but I do not think it is impossible to make a good slasher movie with minimal gore. Take Carpenters Halloween for example  little to no on screen violence, but still an extremely frightening and effective movie. You do not need gore to make a film scary, but even had Prom Night been gratuitously violent which it is not, it is very tame, it still would have added little to the movie because there is not much in the script to build on to begin with. The tension and suspense here is mild at best, and I spent most of the movie predicting the outcome of situations, and was correct about 99 of the time. Our characters are not well written enough either for the audience to make any connection to them, and their bythenumbers demises are routine and careless.I will point out a few things I did like about this movie, though, because it was not completely useless  the cinematography is really nice, and everything was very wellfilmed and fairly stylish. Among the jump scares that are for the most part very predictable, there were a few that were kind of clever. The sets for the movie are nice too and the hotel is a neat place for the plot to unfold, however predictable the unfolding may be. As for the acting, it is mediocre at best. Brittany Snow plays the lead decently, but really the rest of the cast does not show off much talent. Johnathan Schaech plays the villain, and is probably the most experienced performer here, but even he is not that impressive. However, I did like the character he played, which was a nice change from the typical maskedstalker type killer we see a lot. As far as the ending goes, the last fifteen minutes of the film had me bored to my wit is end and it was very anticlimactic.Overall, Prom Night was a disappointment. Everything was very bythenumbers, routine, and predictable, which is somewhat upsetting considering this had the potential to be a decent slasher movie. There were a few neat moments, but the movie lacked any suspense or atmosphere, and had little plot development, nor believable characters. I would advise seasoned horror fans to save their money and wait till it is out on video, or rent the original instead, because there are absolutely no surprises here. Some may find a little entertainment in it, but it was far too predictable for my tastes.

The first film was originally planned to be a sequel to MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, but was quickly rewritten into a standard postapocalyptic martialarts fest that became something of a cult classic due to its cheesy action scenes. CYBORG 2 GLASS SHADOW was a sequel that actually improved upon its predecessor but was not widely seen  was dismissed by those few who saw it as cheap fodder.This film, for one thing, tries to be a meld of the first two films the first was a cheesy action film while the second was a smart Cyberpunk story but unfortunately falls short on both counts. The budget was obviously lower than CYBORG 2, with the film being set in the desert wastelands like so many postapocalyptic action films of the 90s were, shot around old industrial buildings to conserve costs.The films story centres on a plot device, that of a pregnant cyborg, that is as interesting as it is absurd this film is not the first to try that idea; the anime OVA series ARMITAGE III uses it to a greater extent. But the film falls into the same trap that so many lowbudget scifi action films fall victim to, in the fact that the snags synthetic organisms featured are nothing more than androids.

Or Power, Passion, Murder as it is called in Holland. When I bought the film I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was starring in it and I thought that had to say something about the quality. Unfortunately, it did not.1 The plot of the film is really confusing. There are two story lines running simultaneously during the film. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the entire movie I was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me. But it still has not.2 The title of the film says the film will be about Natica Jackson. Well it is, sometimes. Like said the film covers two different stories and the part about Natica Jackson is the shortest. So another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice.To conclude my story, I really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs, on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it. By doing this you will not waste 90 minutes of your life, as I did.","label":0},{"index":8672,"txt":"I bought this on DVD for my brother who is a big Michelle Pfeiffer fan. I decided to watch it myself earlier this week.It is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two. She plays a rising Hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships. She literally bumps into Brian Kerwin A regular married guy with Kidsafter driving her car into the back of his. After being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive. Romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out. What happens at the end I was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine TV direction takes any drama out of the plot.The other section involves an old Studio boss played by Darren McGavin. This section actually has the better cast with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer  Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign, they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere. It passes the time but is not all that interesting and I am glad this was not bought for me. I am not a Michelle Pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress.

We have seen it all before and we have seen it done a million times better then this. If you go to see Prom Night in the theater I would say wait for the DVD or PPV, get ready for the audience to laugh, because laugh they will. The laughs are not at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny, they are in response to key thrilling moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of Scary Movie. Seriously, was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof? The film makers missed the mark so badly here, that a large number of the audience in the theater I attended walked out about halfway through the movie. Which in retrospect, I wish I had done. Not me though, I had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better. Needless to say It did not. The horror scenes are a joke, not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction, the script, the special effects and the camera work. The movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it, but still came out of it with a micro budget movie. I halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking I would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere.

I also did not believe that Pauls parents would go away and leave him with the Dabney family, especially when they had a housekeeper living in the home. Their social classes were too far apart to consider this believable. It seemed the Dabneys lifestyle was too exaggerated. There was a scene in the beginning of the movie that showed Andie MacDowell getting out of a car after having sex with someone. Who was it? Her son? What was the scene supposed to show us? Why was the scene even included? It had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and was in fact never alluded to again. It seemed gratuitous and not fitting into the story at all.

It is a formula that Grade and his company ITC employed throughout the 70s into the early 80s, resulting in titles like The Eagle Has Landed, Firepower, and Raise The Titanic! In 1977 Grade produced March Or Die, a remarkably oldfashioned Foreign Legion adventure that models all the characteristics mentioned above. Directed by the usually dependable Dick Richards \u0096 who helmed the acclaimed Farewell My Lovely just a couple years earlier  March Or Die is an unfortunate disappointment.A company of Foreign Legionnaires led by the harsh disciplinarian General Foster Gene Hackman is sent to Morocco shortly after World War 1. Their mission is to protect an archaeological party fronted by the dedicated Francois Marneau Max Von Sydow. The archaeologists are carrying out an excavation at the ancient city of Erfoud, but fear an attack from Arab tribesmen following the decimation of an earlier archaeological group. Foster is not happy with the assignment \u0096 he does not consider historical artifacts worthy of his men risking their lives. This creates ongoing tension between himself and Marneau, who believes that the legionnaires should sacrifice their lives to make the excavation possible. The problems heighten when a beautiful woman named Simone Picard Catherine Deneuve tags along with the legionnaires. She is hoping to find out what happened to her father, a historian abducted by the Arabs when they wiped out the first archaeological team. Her presence arouses desires amongst the legionnaires, none more so than gypsy thief Marco Segrain Terence Hill, a charming and courageous rogue who initially shows indifference towards his legionnaire colleagues but gradually grows in stature. Things climax with a huge battle at Erfoud, with swarms of united Arab tribes charging against the handful of legionnaires as they desperately try to defend their lives.On paper the star duo of Gene Hackman and Terence Hill seem a mismatch \u0096 Hackman is the heavyweight Oscarwinning character actor, Hill the handsome but limited Italian heartthrob from numerous low budget spaghetti westerns. One expects Hackman to act his counterpart off the screen. Yet, bizarrely, it is Hackman who gives the weak and uninvolving performance, while Hill raises his game to surprisingly high levels. The film is attractively shot on desert locations, but the pacing is awfully slow and few of the characters are worth caring for. Maurice Jarres music is uncommonly flat too \u0096 very disappointing from the guy who gave us the Lawrence Of Arabia score. It is remarkable that anyone had the nerve to try an oldfashioned adventure of this type in the 70s it was a genre that peaked in the 30s, and had been all but forgotten during the intervening decades. Sadly, the gamble does not really pay off \u0096 this homage to the legionnaire flicks of old becomes more of a plod than a march.","label":0},{"index":8680,"txt":"Bugs Bunny accidentally ends up at the South Pole while trying to vacation in Florida.

Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did good jobs with their roles; however, the writers gave them boring dialog. The loveinterest between the two of them was not given any real growth; just suddenly it was there. I did not think much of the music; the best number was the snippet we heard of Spike Jones with Der Fuhrers Face. The one complete number that Spike Jones did had little of his great musical comedy; pretty tame stuff,even with the monkey. Bert Lahrs comedy skits were interminable.There were parts to enjoy Lucille Ball was quite a looker, and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on screen.","label":0},{"index":8685,"txt":"It is curious that the two stars of Meet The People were a pair of movie stars who went into the new medium of television and became even bigger successes and who both went into the production end of things and enjoyed tycoon status on the small screen. Lucille Ball however was not a major star, that would come with television. As for Dick Powell he desperately wanted to get out of doing films like Meet The People and his career salvation would be coming in his next film.I think the only reason that Dick Powell did the film was because a young player from MGM was cast in a specialty number and he was seeing her at the time. His private time with June Allyson was far better than what we see on the screen. Powell looks crashingly bored and cannot summon up any kind of emotion at all.He was probably tired of doing these musicals with silly plots, the kind he ran from Warner Brothers from. The original show Meet The People was not a book show, it was a revue and it ran in the 194041 season on Broadway for 160 performances. When MGM bought it, they scrapped everything but the title and the title song. The rest of the score was patched together from various and sundry songwriters, none of the songs is memorable. Odd when you consider some of the source material is from Burton Lane, E.Y. Harburg, Harold Arlen, and RodgersHart. These guys just must have emptied the trunk for material.The plot is sillier than even most of the musical propaganda pieces of the time. Powell is the writer of a revue called Meet The People and he is a shipyard worker who wins a lottery date with movie star Lucille Ball. She is interested, he is interested, they are both interested in the revue, but creative differences keep them apart of course until the finale. That is the film in a nutshell.MGM did give Powell and Ball some good musical acts which are the main reason for watching Meet The People. The big bands of Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones are here and the highlight of the film for me is Bert Lahr dressed in a commodores suit like Lou Costello had in the dream sequence in In The Navy. The song Heave Ho is written by Arlen and Harburg who wrote for Lahr, the Courage number from The Wizard Of Oz. And as just about everyone in the world has seen that film, you have an idea of Heave Ho is like.Dick Powells next film was Murder My Sweet in which he finally bid a not so fond adieu to musicals.

Simple, The Road Warrior was! Actually any questions can be answered by it was that way in the Road Warrior! Except for the out of work mutant actors from the original 60s The Time Machine film that make a cameo appearance for sake of giving the audience some nonvehicular action to chew on for a few minutes.In typical 80s fashion, all cars driven by bad guys that are bumped or slightly jostled explode in a huge billowing explosion. Inevitably all car chases will happen near convenient cliff sides and cars will unavoidably fall off of them. Along with this 80s cinematic wild ride is the general rampant misogyny in this style of cheapie film. Generally I waited for Traces rocket powered car to accelerate and shoot flames so there would be another shot of him scrunching up his face like he is supposed to be tough, which comes off more as him looking constipated. Badly choreographed action coupled with bad acting makes this film a true sinker. The unintentional humor value even manages to wear thin.Rats Nights of Terror by Bruno Mattei is superior.

It just cannot be done. Instead, I went through what I thought about while watching the movie.Things that I thought about while watching Prom Night I am so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place, only for the main character to wake up right before she bites it. Of course, when I say elaborate deaths, I mean off screen throat slashes or stabs in the stomach. Did not the whole it is just a dream thing get ruined by Dallas? Speaking of which, I wonder if a couple stabs in the gut will cause immediate death.The film is only ten minutes into and I can already count the horror clich\u00e9s on two hands. Not a good sign.Even after just meeting the protagonists boyfriend, I am convinced he will die. Anybody want to place bets? The killer in this movie is a teacher that is obsessed with the main character, Donna. By the way, does anybody think that Donna is a horrible name for a main character in a horror film? He spends three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finds Donna celebrating her high school prom. While there is no accounting for taste, I seriously wonder who would take all that time to stalk somebody as dull as Donna.High schools allow proms to take place at hotels and does not keep track of the students. Apparently students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please. I suppose if this plot point was not in place, the movie would be 90 minutes of people being bored out of their mind and randomly biting the dust whenever they go to the bathroom. I suppose the tradeoff for their excitement is my utter boredom with everything. I have already played count the pieces of chewed bubble gum under the seat and guess how much money I have in my wallet and I am only in the 20 minute mark. How else will I entertain myself? Note to self Do not forget milk and bread on the way home.Dear screenwriter You have used up enough false scares to get through this movie and every other horror remake this year.The 1980 version of this film was not that good but compared to this remake it was like Citizen Kane, or at least The Godfather. It had Jamie Lee Curtis in one of her many postHalloween horror flicks and it did have a little twist at the end. I miss Jamie Lee. I wish she would act more.Apparently at prom there is not much dancing going on. Instead the girls get in fights with their boyfriends over where they plan to attend college. I hear all these colleges being brought up by name, and I cannot help but wonder who these girls have to cheat off of on the entrance exam to get in.The killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning supplies and wipes up his mess between scenes. That is the only logical explanation for why he could stab somebody to death on the carpet or in the bathroom and by the time somebody goes up to the hotel room, there is no trace of a struggle. On another side note This is a very lazy killer. Michael Myers went hunting after his victims. Just saying.It is official the entire audience in the theater is rooting on the killer. What triggered it? Was it whenever Donna went back up to her hotel room while sirens were going off ordering everybody to exit the building? Was it her constant dreams, and how even after going through something dramatic in said dream she insisted on reenacting her steps to a tee? Or was it Brittany Snows unconvincing performance? I will have to say it was all of the above.Okay, who had he dies off screen in the third act? You win the pot.Finally, the movie is over. My friend turns to me and says Donna was not too smart. That is the understatement of the week. Kind of like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind, or a week long power outage is a slight inconvenience.I cannot wait to get on Rotten Tomatoes and see if anybody gave this move a favoring review.I cannot recommend this. I refuse to recommend this. This is as lazy of a horror film as any, and the only way to enjoy its cheese smelling plot is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers.

I will give Chase credit that his very best films  such as Mighty Like a Moose and His Wooden Wedding  have inspired a fandom who are fiercely loyal to him ... but I am positive that even the most diehard Chase fan will agree that the very early and very crude Married to Order just is not funny at all.Chase  eager, awkward, gormless, naff  is a young swain hoping to court the fair Rose. Oliver Hardy gives the best performance in this film as her blowhard father, who disdains Chase as a mollycoddle.

Another major problem with this film were its action sequences. The JapaneseAmerican soldiers do not look like they were fighting German soldiers... let alone anyone.

Movies would change at the theatre each day. As there would be no TV for another decade or so in those parts, this was much of the available entertainment in the town. The Raid seems to have been made for towns like Matewan in the 1950s. Although it was not listed for that month, I am sure showed there some Monday or Tuesday night for an audience which probably was not too demanding.

You can make the woman evil at the beginning and let the audience watch knowingly as she hatches and implements her evil scheme. Or you use misdirection to make her appear a good person, as a seemingly unplanned series of events break in her favor until she is revealed to be evil in the climatic scene.

But the director and editor apparently forgot that this revelation had been made and spend the next 50 minutes laying misdirection to make us think that Alicia is a good person. This introduces the only element of suspense, not about whether she is evil but about when the director and editor will wise up and stop wasting our time with transparent misdirection.New Best Friend suffers more than most from the teen movie curse of a cast too old to be portraying undergraduate students.

It almost works for the 26 yearold Kirshner when she plays the mousy version of Alicia but it becomes glaring when she is transformed into the glamedup version of Alicia. Monroes casting is simply a joke, about like having Nicholette Sheridan try to pass as a classmate on Lizzie McGwire. She looks much closer to a midlife crisis than to a term paper.The producers must have owed a lot of favors because this age issue extends to most of the supporting characters. Taye Diggs who plays the town sheriff is younger than most of the students.The basic setup is that Hadley and two other rich party girls played by Dominque Swainage 21 and Rachel Trueage 35 are undergrad roommates at college. They share as their student residence a mansion that is nicer and better furnished than the mansion on Real WorldNew Orleans a premise more believable than soccer moms playing students. Alicia moves into the mansion and begins to take over Hadleys life. At least that way Swain finally gets a roommate from her own generation so the two can have a lesbian scene. Swains supporting performance is the only good thing about New Best Friend and her love scene with Kirshner is fantastic, so cool and artsy that it does not fit with any of the other segments, maybe it was subcontracted out to a good director and cinematographer.The unintentionally hilarious story is presented in a series of dreary flashbacks of rampant sex and nonstop parties, each proceeded by a shot of a comatose Alicia in a hospital bed. About half of Kirshners screen time is spent lying motionless with a tube in her mouth. Not a good career move Mia.Then again, what do I know? I am only a child.","label":0},{"index":8698,"txt":"PROM NIGHT 2008directed by Nelson McCormickstarring Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davisplot Three years ago, Donna Brittany Snow witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher Jonathan Schaech who has a bit of a crush on her. Now, she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends. Once there, they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn Donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt. pros I got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves.An exampleEveryone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her she does not seem that great has escaped from prison. Their reason They do not want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. LOLcons Let me start off by saying I am a huge slasher fan. Usually I can have fun with even the bad ones. I even like some PG13 horror films. TOURIST TRAP 1979, one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also enjoy POLTERGEIST 1982 and THE GRUDGE 2004. So the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated PG13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie.First of all, I had a big problem with the story. I like slasher films that do not even have stories. At least they can be entertaining. This is about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills her entire family. A few years later, he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends ...? Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone cared about. Claire Jessica Stroup is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and I could not care less. This should have been a Lifetime feature, not a remake of PROM NIGHT. And then ... this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes. I do not even care that it is not that gory, some of my favorite slashers HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT were not that gory but they still had effective murders. Here, we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen, a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds, and a closeup on a bad actors face as he screams in agony. I am sure that 10 yearold girls were terrified, but not me.I also hated the characters. There was Donnas unrealistically sensitive boyfriend Bobby Scott Porter and I can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life, unless you are a gay male. Then we had Donnas annoying friends Claire Stroup and Lisa Dana Davis, and the token mean girl Chrissy Brianne Davis. If you thought the characters in DEATH PROOF were annoying, try watching this movie. And do not get me started on Ronnie Collins Pennie and the DJ Jay Phillips who gave me flashbacks to Ushers performance in She is ALL THAT.Add to all that predictable plot turns, a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material, and you have quite a stinker.","label":0},{"index":8699,"txt":"Not very interesting teen whodunit saved from being a turkey from some decent performances.

I think the main problem is that it is pretty obvious who is responsible for what, and it is generally fairly predictable. Worse yet, some of the flashbacks ended up being confusing, and the viewer is left wondering Okay, how much am I supposed to care? One thing I did like is that the movie goes to show you that it is never THAT simple as the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad, and sometimes it IS evil vs evil rather than good vs evil. Hadley did not do what she did out of a sense of justice, she did it because she considered herself entitled to a job for being family, AND to eliminate the competition. As for Alicia, it simply proves that a victim is not always a good person. Some of them really do have it coming, even if it was a painful, horrible death. The Burning Bed is a great example of this, but the difference is that the vile man in The Burning Bed got exactly what he deserved. But, did Alicia have it coming? Some will say that she did, but others do not agree, and the law generally does not either.As for acting, it is a mixed bag. Some do a good job, like Mia, but others just came across as indifferent to their roles. They were mostly wooden or simply not convincing. The music was pretty cool though and some of the scenes are nice and steamy, especially if you like girlgirl action. The movie is not badly shot at all, but given its glaring weaknesses, the strengths are in background, unfortunately.I have heard rumors of a sequel, but given the years, I doubt it will happen. But, I would not be surprised if a sequel suddenly appeared. If Alicia is as EVIL, conniving and horrible as people say, then I do not think she will be thinking, YAY! I woke up from a coma! Oh, Hadley was responsible? Oh! That is okay! I totally forgive her and want the charges dropped! No way Hadley would be in jail for long anyway, if she even does any time since no murder actually happened.

Excuse the language, but there are not any decent words to describe it.First of all, the actors are not the best. But even better actors would not have rescued the movie. E.g. the plot after the first 15 minutes it was quite clear that John was sick, the neighbour girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend. The so called sexscene was nothing else but disgusting hitting each other until blood flows for me has not anything to do with sexuality, but unfortunately that were not the only disgusting images to be shown. Everything else was copied by other directors like e.g. Lynch, but of course without their geniality.So, to summarize the whole film and to save other viewers time and money guy loses girlfriend, girlfriend turns back home, guy kills girlfriend and becomes mad afterwards, guy imagines hot, but crazy neighbour girls, guy has very disgusting sex with one of them or so he thinks, in the end he realizes, he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lay in his apartment all the time... bad story, bad actors, pictures, that make you want to vomit...1 out of 10 1 point for the fact, that you realize how good you can understand Norwegian if you learned Swedish  at least one benefit of the evening  and you cannot choose 0 points here.","label":0},{"index":8704,"txt":"In reviewing this film I can only go by my experiences as a weekend warrior doing my basic training in July, August, and September of 1971 in that garden spot of the earth, Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take the High Ground was not anything like I remember basic training.But one has to remember at the time this was post Korea which ended in a stalemate, but it was a conventional war as we knew them. It was not Vietnam, a jungle guerrilla war where we kept pouring draftees into an endless pit. The draft at that time was an unwelcome, but accepted as still necessary for the countrys defense.Richard Widmark is a veteran of Korea now assigned state side to train the troops to go overseas. The film is about one of his training cycles and the men of the platoon he has to train. They are the usual kind you would find in just about any war film from the previous decade. One thing I will praise Take The High Ground for is the fact that MGM recognized our army was now an integrated one with the presence of William Hazard as a black recruit in the platoon. It was in keeping with the spirit of the times which were a changing.But I will say that a recruit like Russ Tamblyn would have been cured of his smart mouth from day one. Richard Widmark would have not risked death or becoming a eunuch in order to give Jerome Courtland confidence with a weapon. And no way would have he worried so much about Robert Arthur deserting. He is have just let the MPs deal with him.Of course being shot in and around Fort Bliss and El Paso, Texas did give Take the High Ground good authenticity. But view it as an army recruiting film and you can certainly understand why the government so eagerly gave cooperation back in the day.I do remember the drill sergeants having their little conflicts which you could pick up on when you were not worried about them getting on your case for something which was 95 of the time. But there as not no way that Karl Malden would have slugged Widmark out in the open during training in front of several witnesses among the recruits. Both would have realized that would have undermined authority, something the military just does not let happen.I wish I could have said something better about Take The High Ground because I certainly like its talented cast, it is talented director Richard Brooks, even the silly theme by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, fresh from their Oscar a year before for High Noon. The film actually got an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and story by Millard Kaufman. It must have been for Kaufmans vivid imagination.","label":0},{"index":8705,"txt":"If you appreciate the renaissance in Asian horror, do not bother with Gawi. The film scarcely deserves mention alongside Alist work such as Ringu, A Tale of Two Sisters, Cure, and JuOn or even such good material as The Eye or Inner Senses. Those films brim with subtleties, unexpected imagery, rich characters, and a decidedly nonWestern take on what is frightening. Gawi is strung together with the leftover limbs and organs of everything that has made American horror lousy for the past twentyfive years.The film tries to blend Asian ghost story and Hollywood slasher flick, but it is a bad fit. One aesthetic is bound to smother the other; guess which? Having no story of their own to tell the filmmakers loot Ringu for an evilchild subplot, but the situation is hopeless.

After this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret, but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways. Through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group, but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences. So, is she back from the grave seeking revenge? Oh what a great and always spooky story! Well, that is what I hoping I could say. And hoping was as good as it got. This is an forgettable, soso supernatural horror flick that I actually watched before, but I went in thinking it was my first viewing. So to my surprise it hit me when I started picking up on certain things, but like I said it is quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again. Nightmare is just another type of it is field that adds a few changes to the gruel. Oh, please give me something that is a bit more fresh. It does not have to be entirely original, but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired Jhorror flick. Even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed right\u0085 an evil looking, vengeful chick spirit.But in spite of my negativity of it being the same old, same old story and jolts. This one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals. The deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality. While, the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with it is murky lighting. The first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one bloodcurdling experience, but really when it is not trying to shock you. I found it rather coma inducing and I thought about getting some shuteye. That might be harsh, but it just did not go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments. You could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one, the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a selfcentred bunch that you do not really care what happens to them. The disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship. It just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it is just plain ludicrous. The films haunting ending is a high point, though.The film looks fine, although it could have done without the snazzy, quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood. The performances tread a fine line, but Gyuri Kim is strong in the lead role.It is nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas, but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills.

Apart from a few saving graces, it is nothing to write home about. Jhorror has boomed for the last fivesix years but the films themselves have on more than one account been repetitive and carbon copies of a previous success. This is one of them.Basically this is a supernatural slasher movie. The beginning is promising with chilling scenes from a morgue where a dead girl has her eyes graphically sewn together, but soon after opens them. However, after that, it is quickly downhill for this flick.To be kind I will start with the things I like about Gawi. On the plus side, the visuals are gaudy and the movie looks great for it is type. For those who like their horror movies gory there are a few nicely executed no pun intended murder scenes. We also get a few good suspense sequencessetpieces.However, there are quite a few drawbacks also...First of all, and my major complaint about this movie, is that the plot skips and jumps forwards and backwards in time with an alarming intensity. Usually that is not a problem for me, but here, where the students look exactly the same no matter what age they are, I was confused on more than one occasion.The performances are okay I guess a little hard to tell when you do not know the language, but seem a little stiff.

I am glad I went to see it in theaters so I would not buy it for 15.00 and then hate it. It was just bad. It would have been better if only one thing would have happened.

A bad idea would be to have actors playing buffoons whom just happen to be called Laurel and Hardy. As bad as that is, it might have worked.

Okay, forget his wacky foreigner Cousin Larry schtick in Perfect Strangers, and look at him in True Romance. Here though, he stinks. It is probably not all his fault, and, like the director and the support cast  all of who are better than the material  he was probably just desperate for money. There are those who claim Americans find it difficult to master an effective English accent. This cause is not helped here by Pinchot. What is Stan? Welsh? Iranian? Pakistani? Only in Stans trademark yelp does he come close, though as the yelp is overdone to the point of tedium that is nothing to write home about. Gailard Sartain does slightly better as Ollie, though it is like saying what is worse  stepping in dog dirt or a kick in the knackers?

Well that is absent altogether, replaced with two stupid old men and jokes so mistimed you could park a bus through the gaps.

I cannot claim to have seen every single one of Laurel and Hardys 108 movies, but I think it is a safe bet that even their nadir was leagues ahead of this.Maybe the major problem is that the originals were sortof playing themselves, or at least using their own accents.

That is not slapstick. That is not even funny. That is just...boring...and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes. It is as though they are this movies bread and butter. The writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like they are supposed to be funny. Granted, the example I just gave is the most extreme case, but I can only cut it so much slack.Long story short The film just does not work because the script fails to capitalize on Pinchots and Sartains abilities to impersonate Stan and Ollie. Instead, the script capitalizes on plot exposition and lame jokes. Watching this movie is basically watching two excellent impersonators who were given no real material to work with.Not a good movie, but an incredible sleeping aid.I say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal just so long as you steer clear of Atoll K and Be Big.","label":0},{"index":8720,"txt":"This movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood.

For no reason he kills the mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction. Years later, obsessed teacher breaks out of prison.

Dialogue is torn from old LH movies and planted in unrealistically, the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless costars, Pinchots accent was bizarre for Stan, and while Sartain did an excellent job with Ollies accent, he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy. Where was a good musical number? Editing is choppy, acting is stiff, lines are horrid, physics are implausable although perhaps they were TRYING to give it that feel of cheap sets?, and overall it is a terrible thing to witness. It is even more painful to watch than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950s era writing and photography. Do yourself a favor and watch as much of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films as you can, and learn how things WERE. You know what a MAGNATE is, do not you?

Character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless, with many loopholes, and missing pieces of information which i would not have known if i had not read the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the movie was the support roles from Nisha Kothari and especially this new dude called Prashant Raj. Nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open. As for Prashant Raj  seriously who is this guy? where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks?. His acting ability is zero and he has the same tone, dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene, whether it be action, comedy, or even a scene when someone has just died.

No Alist actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same billing as him for all the humiliation this film is bound to carry with it.But lets not just blame the director here, there is the cinematographer, who looks like he is rehearsing for the amateur home movie maker of the year award. There is the over dramatic score, that hopes to carry you to the next scene. The lighting man, who must have been holding a cigarette in one hand and light bulb on pole in the other, and hoping that the flame burning off the cigarette would add to that much needed light in every scene. And, of course the actors! Some of them are by no means newcomers, else all could be forgiven here. The ensemble of actors in Aag were put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the remake of Indias most loved movie of all time, Sholay. One must not forget that these actors were not forced in to this film, they are Alist and willing participants to something that, let us face it would surely have had high and eager public expectation??? So it begs the question, Amitabh aside for now, did the other actors really believe their performances even attempted to better the original? Did Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in this farcical abomination of a film? Do not be stupid, of course he did not, this was a demonstration to the public of how much money talks hence can make actors walk.I truly hope everyone involved is satisfied with what is truly a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film, which only succeeds in polluting everyones mind when they watch the original.","label":0},{"index":8732,"txt":"Good grief I cannot even begin to describe how poor this film is.

Waste of money, waste of time. After making movies like Rangeela, Satya, and Company he pulled a Coppola Godfather on us; What were you thinking RGV?

The Thakur goes south.Mohanlal as Narsimha the police inspector whose family has been killed seeks vengeance Madrasi style. The accent is totally South Indian in contrast to Thakur from the north. The severing of the hands of Thakur by Gabbar is also cut down to the fingers in Aag. So make up costs are cut down because there is no effort to hide the hands instead only a long shouldered Kurta covers up for the cut fingers. Moreso in the climax where the Thakur uses his legs and saysTere Liye to mere paer hi kaafi hai here Narsimha uses his finger stubs to fire a gun and kill the villain. Babban, the new avtar of gabbar is also different. He is not from Bihar or UP. He is Bambaiya. Gabbars infamous laugh is also in two instalments this time and is more subdued. Babban asks for Diwali instead of Holi and romances Urmila the replacement of Helen in Mehbooba. he also dances and enjoys dancing with Abhisheh who plays Jalal Agha in Mehbooba.Babban is more intelligent this time. He tosses the apple and asks the question that made Isaac Newton discover laws of gravitation. Basanti is more verbose than the Auto driver Ghungroo. Nisha Kothari cannot play the auto driver and looks too artificial using words like entertain and too much with gay abandon. Viru was fun whereas Ajay Devgun is a misfit for the role. The God Speaks to Basanti incident and the shooting lessons and the Koi Haseena song and the water tank sequences are painful. The water tank turns into a well and the drunk Devgun is so bad in the sequence that the audience would have wanted him to commit suicide. Jai was composed and serious. Prashant Raj is better than the others because we do not expect anything from him. But he also bungles on the Mausi sequence. He is not as romantic as Jai with the mouth organ . Jayas role played by Sushmita changes careers. A pure housewife turns into a doctor this time plunging into full time social service after her husband is killed. She too lacks the pain that Jaya displayed. Her flirtations with Jai are more open this time. Samba gets a bigger role this time as Tambe. He does not have to point guns and answer questions of Gabbar this time. He follows Babban wherever he goes and is a bodyguard with more visibility outside the den. Horses give way to Jeeps and auto. The Gabbars hideout here keeps changing and Ramgarh becomes Kaliganj. All in all it is more of a spoof than anything else. RGV comes up with his own interpretation of the classic.

And the movie is a very BGrade movie, something that I had not hoped.I really tried looking for positives, but I promised to keep Sholay out of my mind. The cinematography is awesome. The movie tries to be its own. But that is the up side. The action sequences are weak. The screenplay had potential. The biggest flaw is editing. None of the scenes excite you. For example, the comedy sequences felt very out of place and forced. Ironic because comedy was just as entertaining in the original. And none of the characters are developed. And no scenes will linger until the end. And the ending was very disappointing.The biggest question is acting. Amitabh Bachchan was good as Gabbar Singh, nothing great. It seemed as if they concentrated too much on his look, that the character only looks menacing, but you do not get creeped out. Mohanlal is barely in the movie, but he impresses in his few scenes. Ajay Devgan was decent. It was not so much the performance, he gave it his all, it was the weak script. Prashant Raj is very confident, and has potential to make it far with better movies.I had most expectations for Sushmita Sen, who was probably the best of the lot. She was expressive, but this still was not enough. Nisha Kothari surprised me. She seemed disinterested for the most part, but her emotional scene after her friends death was quite good. Seems as if she needs to find a director who will help her talent, not her cute looks. But what disappointed me most was chemistry. Ajay Devgan and Prashant Raj did not look like friends. AjayNisha were not a strong couple. No passion was to be found between Sushmita and Prashant. And Amitabh and Mohanlal did not the hateful passion they needed.As for songs, they pretty much suck. Urmilas Mehbooba was too overblown and I pretty much slept through it. It was however nicely danced. The Holi number was enjoyable, but not memorable. Same went for the other songs. For someone who looked forward to this movie, I was heavily disappointed. I had high hopes for RGV because of his Jungle, but seems as if he lost his talent during the shooting of this movie.

What Aag does is take these characters and mess them up so badly ull need a contest to pick the worst.

Before I start my review, let me tell you one thing I wanted to like this movie. I know I have been negative in the past, but I was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film. I did not.It is not just the fact that every horror clich\u00e9 imaginable is in this. And it is not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare walking into a baseball bat left on the floor? Are you kidding me?. It just was not scary. One thing I was surprised about there was more blood than I thought there was going to be.. which is not saying much.The film starts off with Donna being dropped off by Lisas mom at her house. She comes in.. goes upstairs. Camera pans to her father dead on the couch. Spooky. She goes upstairs, where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens. Finds her brother on his bed, apparently dead how could she tell? He did not have a spot of blood on him. Killer comes in, Donna hides under bed, mom dies. She runs outside screaming for help. Killer behind her I did it for us. Cut to therapy session. This confused a lot of people everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back. Filler dialogue ensues.THey cut to the chase pretty quick. Few scenes at the salon, they go to the hotel. Of course the killer is already there for some reason, he escaped 3 days ago but the policefamily were not informed until he is already there. More filler ensues.I am not going to go on about what happens in the film, because I do not want to spoil it too much. If you want to know who dies, Horror_Fan made a post about it already. But on the subjects of deaths they were not that exciting. People in the theatre actually laughed out loud an experience I have never had before in a horror movie, not even in When A Stranger Calls during several of them. One in particular the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious scared face I have ever seen. The only death involving any blood was Lisas, and that was pretty scarce. Her throat is slashed, blood if you can even call it that it was practically black splatters on the curtainthing. The only other blood was on Claire when we see her body. Apparently, Fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death. Um, okay? The movie was one of the most clich\u00e9d I have ever seen. Let us see here.. obligatory closemirrorcurtainBOOM! scene. Check. Twice, actually you could tell they were struggling. Mandatory backingupintokiller. Check. There is also the backingupintolamp scene, but you have all seen that. Oh, you say you want a birdsflyingaway scare? Well, you got it! Yes, they managed to incorporate one of those in here. And, of course, the wehavesecurityonallexitsbuthestillescaped scene. Shall I go on? I could.For anyone saying the characters were not stupid, are you kidding me? Oh, even though the massive alarm is ringing, literally saying PLEASE VACATE THE BUILDING, and 3 of my friends are missing, I am going to go upstairs to get my wrap. These characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever. The only likable character  Lisa  made one of the most stupid moves in the movie. Oh, I just realized the psychoteacher is here! I must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her! Oh, shoot, the elevator is being to slow? Guess I will take the stairs and run off into the construction site! Ugh. By the end of the film, they all deserved to die. The only death anyone felt any remorse for was Donnas boyfriend I cannot even remember his name is that bad?, and by that time, the audience was completely drained out of this scareless, clich\u00e9d film.There were SOME positives the acting was decent for the most part, and it was wellshot. But that is about it.I would give it a 15, and that is being generous. Just for the laughs and believe me, the audience had a few, and Brittany Snow.Oh, and the reaction was bad. Very bad. People were booing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative. Expect bad legs for this one.","label":0},{"index":8744,"txt":"I cannot come up with appropriate enough words to describe the horror I felt sitting in that cinema watching Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag, the directors halfhearted attempt to pay tribute to that classic Bollywood western, Sholay. The biggest problem with Varmas remake is that he does not even try to make a credible film. It is evident in every single frame of this movie that Varmas heart is just not in it. What you see on screen is a bad joke at best, a gimmick on the part of the filmmaker, and it pains you to see what little regard he actually shows for a film he claims he is been a fan of all his life.I have seen several bad films over the years, but I cannot remember one that is been as much of a torture to sit through as this one. Consider yourself very brave if you are able to survive the entire film, because it tests your patience like few films have before.Varma may borrow his plot and characters from the original film, but his version is trite and hollow and does not have any of the spirit and energy of Sholay. Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag is actually a mockery of that timeless gem because it turns out to be everything that the original film was not  wayoverthetop, toolongtooboring, and entirely mindless. Muchloved moments from Sholay are parodied by Varma and for that you want to wring his neck. One of the most memorable scenes in Sholay in which Dharmendra as Veeru climbs up the watertank and threatens to jump down to his death is turned around in this film with Ajay Devgan playing Hero, pulling a pistol to his head threatening to shoot himself. How you wish he would pulled the trigger and spared us all the agony.Not only does Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag fail as a remake of Sholay, it is a pretty bad effort even as a standalone film. The eardrumdamaging background score sounds more like someone clanging vessels in the kitchen, and the camerawork alternates between dramatic and headspinning. Partners in this terrible crime of bringing this ridiculous film to screen are the films mostly deadaswood actors. Sushmita Sen as Devi the widow takes both her role and the film too seriously, punctuating her lines with pauses, staring into camera for effect, and generally performing like her life depends upon it. Mohanlal as Narsimha, struggles with his Hindi dialogue and looks embarrassed to be delivering some of the stupidest lines in his illustrious career. Newcomer Prashant Raj playing Jaiequivalent Raj has no acting chops to speak of and cannot strum up any of the brooding intensity Amitabh Bachchan brought to the part in the original film.As Hero, the newage Veeru, Ajay Devgan is entirely hopeless, failing miserably in his attempts at comedy. But the films weakest link, easily the most shocking casting decision is Nisha Kothari as Ghunghroo, who steps into the shoes of Hema Malini as Basanti, the endearing airhead from Sholay. Nisha Kothari is not only the worst actress in this country, but possibly the worst actress in this whole wide world, she gives the word annoying a whole new meaning, and she makes you want to slit your wrists every time she is on screen. And then, there is Amitabh Bachchan playing Babban Singh, Ramgopal Varmas version of Hindi cinemas most popular villain Gabbar Singh. The only actor in this ensemble who recognises the films overthetop tone and plays along accordingly, Bachchan constructs a menacing character who is a treat to watch. He is meant to be a comic book villain who snarls and sneers and hisses and hams, and he does all of that to good effect. But because he is trapped in such a doomed enterprise, his performance does not really help elevate the film in any way.No surprises here, I am going with zero out of ten and two thumbs down for Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag, it ones of those painful moviewatching experiences you would not subject even an enemy to. It is not like Varma has not handled a remake before. With Sarkar he gave us a smart, gripping take on The Godfather, and it is a pity he is made this Sholay bhature out of such a muchloved classic. Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag is his worst career decision ever, it is also a dark spot on his resume he will be embarrassed of forever. I suspect this film will go down in movie history as Ramgopal Varma Ka Daag.","label":0},{"index":8745,"txt":"Something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot.

Here in Aag the figure was 100 crores for Babban Amitabh Bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so called heros and had only few men bikes to commute with all automatic guns. Making a Sholay like movie in Mumbai type setup in modern time does not look convincing. 4 As for Nisha Kothari, somebody needs to tell her that she does not know acting. Why is Ram Gopal Verma casting her again and again ? 5 Mohanlal was good but there is hardly anything for him to do. 6 Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav who are great actors are wasted in the movie. 7 Legendry role played by Lila Misra Mausi of Basanti in Sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some Gangu Mummy. Ramu please grow up and understand that there needs to be some intellect in your movie. Enough of stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8 Should not say anything about modern Jai and Veeru..pathetic to the greatest extent.To summarize, I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of original classic.

But even then I thought it would be a great RGV treat, after all is not he the same guy who directed Sathya and Company? Or is he? I have my doubts after watching Aag. I am not going to talk about the plot or the story, as most of it is taken from the original, if you are really dying to go and see this one, you could play a fun game with friends identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own! So Veeru becomes Heero how corny is that?, guess Heeru would not sound that great. Ajay Devgan is quite a disaster as Heero, the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that really was effective in Company sounds fake. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo Nisha Kothari does not exists at all. In fact the more charming Nisha tries to be the more irritating she becomes. This reaches a peak by the end. Raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others, he is a guy to watch in the future. I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl all covered in a shawl, instead of inspiring fear he looks like a beggar with his bowl.

Mohanlal who is an excellent actor did an okay job. Amitabh was alright.. the director wanted to portray how evil his character is but he went a bit overboard which resulted in it being forceful.

This movie is made to fall like a brick. I was cringing to leave the theater, but I was forced to sit because I would not have been able to take my car out of the parking lot before others also left. Else, nothing would have made me sit beyond interval.This movie is nowhere close to Sholay. It does not even come near it within a mile. I believe Ramu surely loves The Godfather more than Sholay, since Sarkar was a classic piece of work. I read Ramus interview a couple of days back, in which the interviewer said that Ramu does not sleep for more than 4 hours a day, that too not at a stretch. I completely agree with this now, as his lack of sleep has probably taken its toll on the movie.There is no power in the performance. Amitabh Bachchan does not even look scary. He looked more terrifying in the few posters and wallpapers I saw earlier. Ramus favorite Nisha Kothari did a fantastic job in Sarkar because she did not have many dialogs in fact none if I remember clearly.

Anna is a character that believes America is her safety net, her home, and it can do her no wrong \u0096 but she refuses to belittle herself to do work she does not believe in. She is hardnosed, optimistic, stubborn, and arrogant when it comes to her life, yet not afraid to let others in, yet drop them at a moments notice. Anna flipflops between personalities, which makes this film ideal of an aging star, but not idea of the viewing audience. Anna has been praised for its star Sally Kirkland, and her ability to get grungy for the role, but a month into 2008, Anna does not remain a staple of film culture. It is dated, dull, and formulaically chaotic.Director Yurek Bogayevicz has a message hidden within Anna about the falsehoods of Czechoslovakia, both politically and socially, but Kirkland refuses to let them upstage her. Bogayevicz is not afraid to play with the camera, to use wooden frames to allow Kirkland to stand out, and he is not afraid to lessen the surrounding characters so that when you walk away from the film, it is Kirkland you remember. If it is not obvious, this film did not sit well with me. From the opening of the first act and deep within the second, Anna felt like a high school theater production. The characters were nonexistent, there was no enlightening prestory, and there was no definition of time or place. There was Sally Kirkland, stubbornly saying that she is better than the other actresses vying for the same lifestyle that she wants. Randomly she encounters a friend, a young girl that has also traveled a long distance to get to America for the glitz and glamour, and two of them within the span of 20 minutes build a friendship that could break all walls. It is emotionally boring and unbelievable. Again, randomly, we meet Annas boyfriend Daniel played by the weak Robert Fields, who brings nothing to the table in terms of definition or character \u0096 only to boost the attention onto Kirklands Anna. Through the course of nearly two hours, we watch as more random acts coupled with unnamed characters intertwine together to feebly create a story that is held together by loose threads \u0096 and SALLY KIRKLAND. Arg, it pains me to continue to say this but Anna could have been a fantastic film had Bogayevicz presented equal time between Anna, Daniel, and Krystina, but instead we are forced into a onesided game where emotional scenes speak louder than plot.Is this where Charlize Theron found inspiration for her beautyless role in Monster, or Halle Berry in Monsters Ball? Was Sally Kirkland one of the early actresses discover that by letting themselves go for a character Oscar will shine in their direction? Throughout this film I was disgusted by Kirklands portrayal of Anna, and Bogayeviczs lack of excitement for anything else fluent. Bogayevicz gives us an Anna that does not work hard for her parts, does not care for others, and is generally mean spirited \u0096 yet we are to feel sympathy for her? Near the beginning of the film, she forces what she wants to do onto others, and gets upset when she does not get her way. Sure, aging actresses my have that appeal to them, but Kirkland creates a more childish character instead of a mature one. That is where Anna could have improved. If this was a mature Kirkland, I would have gobbled it up, but this stammering childish Anna was impossible to believe. While my favorite scene was near the end where Anna goes to watch one of her older films playing included is absurd makeout characters and the film burns, this scene is also one of my least favorite. Anna has made a phenomenal life for herself, creating films and building the dream, yet when anyone else wants to enter that spotlight, she gets jealous and outraged. This did not make for a character I wanted to stand behind nor win Oscars. Coupled with the classic 80s background synthesizer, the outrageous overthe top wardrobe, and the displaced ending where did that come from and what happened?? \u0096 Anna slipped far in the scope of amazing cinema. It was a showpiece, an opportunity for an aging star to yell at the world one more time. In this one it worked, but I do not think I will be fooled again.Overall, I cannot say that I was impressed with this film. Anna is not a film about an aging film star; it is about Sally Kirkland, and ONLY Sally Kirkland. Bogayevicz tries to do more with the story, but fails either because Kirkland will not allow him or he just realizes that there is not enough to support a full story. There are one or two decent scenes in this film, but nothing that promotes this film as innovative or influential. Bogayevicz did not create a character that audiences would believe, tear up for, or dedicate a Sunday afternoon with \u0096 he created an annoyance. Kirkland was not Anna, she was an actress playing her a bit overdone and crusty on the sides. Perhaps I missed the scope of this film, but what makes films like this work is the cooperation of everyone involved. That was not the case here. In Anna, Kirkland orders Daniel to act like a dog apparently as a symbolic act and yet during the entire emotional scene, I could not help but think that was what Kirkland was like to those on the set. She did not make this into a film, she transformed it into her own production, and because of it Anna failed. I cannot suggest this to anyone \u0096 from one Czech to another \u0096 skip it!

The reason I am being so harsh is because this film was clearly a different take on Of Mice and Men and they should sue because it is such a horrible ripoff of the story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt...for someone to take a classic book and film Of Mice and Men and destroy it with a new spin bugs me so much. The actors, the accents, the dialog and the direction were amateurish and the writing was dismal.

The original Prom Night, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. Sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! The scares were cheap, and foreshadowed terribly. A good example of scare which has been done to clich\u00e9d excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film This film could not successfully pull that off, so how could I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. There needs to be a likable hero or heroine. This film does not have one. The person I most identified with was the head detective. His calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. Common sense approach to events that occur. If you are running from an Axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killers progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path. If you friend disappears, you do not go looking for them alone. And if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. These clich\u00e9s are tired and well overplayed.

The Cajuns were portrayed as backwards rednecks. Most of the Cajuns I know are well educated, proud people and do not sound uneducated at all when they talk the way these people did. All in all it was an OK movie, with great scenery and music. I understand that the writers were from Lake Charles, and have knowledge of the area, but for the love of all things Cajun, please have the actors study the language, live amongst the people you are portraying and get an all around understanding of how they are before you go trying to act like them.

Stacey Keachs ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him. Do not know how any viewer could relate to his excessive portrayal? The most credible performance is given by Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs. It strains credulity that the handsome male suitors in this epic would remain ever single while they patiently await the subject of their affections to finally consent to accept them. Can anybody believe that handsome Robert Urich would remain single for decades waiting for Stephanie Powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals? The WW2 engagement between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is laughable. To begin with, the Germans did not occupy the Provence section of France until late in the war, it was controlled by the Vichy French puppet government.

I like the fact she is caring, and is more a mother figure to Timmy. However, despite all this, I do not like this show, it is not excrement but I do find it very annoying.I would not say that it is the best animated show on Planet Earth. When I use that term for an animated TV show, I think of Peter Pan and the Pirates, I think of Darkwing Duck, I think of Scooby Doo and I think of Talespin. And I hope I am not the only one who really likes the Wild Thornberrys and resent the fact it gets poked fun at. Nor do I think Fairly Odd Parents is the worst animated show on Planet Earth.

But the worst animated show I have ever seen is Shaggy and Scooby DooGet a Clue, which is crudely animated, unfunny and frankly a disgrace.One thing I do not like about this show is the animation. The characters, forgive me if I offend, have very weird facial features, and a lot of the backgrounds are dull and lack the colour that make Spongebob Squarepants and Wild Thornberrys so nice to look at. The characters with the exception of Wanda I find very annoying. I cannot believe such a talented voice actress like Tara Strongaka. Charendoff voiced Timmy. Timmy I do not find very likable as a lead character at all, he is annoying and sometimes patronising, and he is a poor decision maker as well. And his voice gets on my nerves. I actually like Strong but not in this show. Another annoying character is Cosmo, the supposedly funny character. Instead, his jokes are as unfunny as they could become. They are either a contrived, or b over familiar. Timmys parents are awful characters, who do not give a toss about their son, and their personalities wear well thin.The story lines are very unoriginal on the most part, and I keep thinking, where have I seen this before. The episodes after the arrival of the baby I thought were unwatchable. Even worse is the scripts, very unfunny, childish, witless and suffer from a complete lack of energy.All in all, not the worst show ever, but pretty poor for an animation fan, and fairly uncomfortable to sit through. 310 there are redeeming qualities, and I completely understand if people like it.

Though my age probably plays a major role in how I judge this show, after reading others reviews, I have come to see that after the third season, this show went down the tubes. I agree. This show is obnoxious, repetitive and usually focuses on the same plot.The show revolves around Timmy Turner, who was granted two Fairy Godparents because basically his life was horrible  his parents were never around, and he had a nasty babysitter. The plot of the entire show is that this kid Timmy and his Godparents always wish up some destruction that cannot be prevented by making another wish, because something in Da Rules says they cannot. The show has a lot of lines that keep being repeated, like magic cannot break true love, super toilet or even just some scummy jokes lines that Nickelodeon probably thought was funny and decided to put in the episode various times.The show is aimed at kids younger than 10, because it involves gross situations and kid humor that most kids of my age would not care for. The character voice selection could have been better too. Timmy has an extremely loud, shrill, feminine voice as does Cosmo. Wanda sounds like an old lady. Timmys dad sounds like some announcer or game show host, Timmys moms voice is too exaggerated to sound feminine. Attitudes in this show are in some episodes, Timmy talks back and acts spoiled and snobbish. Wanda apparently is smart and wise. Cosmo is stupid, dumb and incapable of thinking as is Timmys dad. Timmys mom seems to end up doing whatever Timmys dad does.The show is too far flung from reality to get my likings anymore. Maybe as a younger kid, I could see more of the humor in this show, but as I grow up, it really grows old.

You can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp, but that is pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a clich\u00e9 joke. Next there are the kiddie jokes. Lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people crossdressing. LOLOLOL!!! I just cannot stop laughing at such gay bliss! Somebody help me! But of course, this show would not suck that bad if it were not for stereotypes. Did you see how the team portrayed Australians? They saw them as nothing but kangarooloving, boomerangthrowing simpletons who live in a hot desert. But now... Is the coup de grace of WHY this show truly sucks the loudest of them all... OVERUSED JOKES!!! The show constantly pulls up the same jokes the majority of them being unfunny thinking it is like the greatest thing ever! Cosmo is mostly the one to blame. I hated how they kept on mentioning Super Toilet which also has a blend of kiddish humor in it just as well and Cosmo would freak out.

You know, the one in which every single parent oblivious to other parents saying it would utter the EXACT same sentence before breaking into their kids room?

Cosmo sounds like a whining mongrel, Vicky sounds like a stereotypical shrew, and Timmys dad makes every line sound like a bad impersonation of a game show host Guy Smiley from Sesame Street comes to mind.The animation is awful; even the producers of YuGiOh! laugh at the overwhelmingly bad artwork on this show. Every character has buck teeth, or a square head, or a head three sizes too big for his or her body. And what is with having the characters speak every single line wideeyed and grinning, as though posing for a photo op with the president? Then, there is the fact that every character on the show is completely moronic. Not since the subtle grace of Amelia Bedelia, Homer Simpson, and Buddy Lembeck of Charles in Charge fame have characters been portrayed as so unrealistically dumb. Usually unrealistic is synonymous with unfunny, and that is most definitely the case here. There has not been this much slapstick based on cluelessness since The Naked Gun 33 13...and at least Leslie Nielson was good at it.Finally, the premise of the show and it is the same every single episode, so big time spoiler alert here Timmy wishes for something with his two Fairly Oddparents, something goes wrong, there is always some contrived reason why he cannot immediately reverse course and wish away the damage, and then everything turns out just fine in the end.

Maybe it is just me, but it seems that a kids show containing the subtle message that it pretty much does no good whatsoever to tell on an abusive babysitter probably is not a great idea. If you are writing a paper and want to cite an example of just how far the quality of cartoons has fallen, The Fairly Odd Parents has to be a great place to start.

He certainly makes it appear effortless to make all the nuanced little adjustments as we learn more about Harlan. However, with too many small changes it means we are never sure exactly where Harlan is coming from, and what seemed like a good performance from Norton gradually becomes confused. Evan Rachel Wood is likable without ever really having a great deal to do other than bat her eyelids at Norton.Down in the Valley strikes as a slightly uneven tale due to its change of pace, and by never really making the protagonists motives clear the audiences sympathies for the characters remain uncertain. Should we like this drifter or not? Even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear. This ambiguity is to the films detriment, as if the writer could not make up their mind what kind of story they wanted to tell and settled for somewhat of a hotchpotch. Had the film remained one or the other it might have been a solid film, but as it is what we are left with is something of a mess.

This was on an occasion where stopping to shave would not be an option. These continuity discrepancies totally distracted me from the rest of the movie and ruined any credibility it had previously had.

And in this picture the main players have an obsession with guns, so it is not difficult to work out the way this movie will ultimately unfold. America can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre how society in the USA has such an obscene and fatal gun culture.

The cowboy is seduced by the teenage girl or viceversa, and the impressionable boy is seemingly taken in by the lunacy of the loser.The cowboy spends the whole time in a state of unreality and depression.A total loser who prefers to go to the beach then work for living, and then commits a burglary on his family as he is too lazy to make money legally.Ask yourselfWho wants to watch either a sad failed loser in a fantasy world holding a death wish, or indeed view a poor family who are in effect not much better than white trash?!This film is pointless drivel.It only saves itself from getting the lowest mark possible by some half listen able music210.","label":0},{"index":8797,"txt":"I saw this film in my cinema class.

There was no central, connecting theme to the movie. Was it a romance between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it a western? Kind of, but no. I am all for twists in movies, I recently saw Brick and loved it, but the place that this movie went was just too out there. It was so weird, and if I were not required to have sat through the whole film, I would have walked out. The writing was not terrible, but it was just all over the place.

Why, oh why, then mess it up halfway through by making the lead character Nortonanother psycho? Maybe I am missing the point, but do we really need another film about psychos? Or is this need in Hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature indicative of a more general malaise in the movie industry? For a moment there, I was going to make a mental note of the directors name; now I am left feeling indifferent.

That said, I will give this movie credit for good gore and creature effects but that is all. This is a case of effects over story. Truth is we live in a time where there is very little left that has not been seen in a horror film. Therefor for a film of any kind to really entertain it must have a good, original story.

Besides, this is an alien movie of sorts, and sounded something like Stephen Kings Dreamcatchers, one of those movies that the critics hated, but I enjoyed.But nope, unfortunately I felt that for the most parts, Altered is a waste of time, so I shall keep this review short. Premises are always promising, and Altereds no different. It tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger, and as usual, others will take you as a nutcase imagining stuff. Stories about alien abduction always have to deal with probes into the orifices, so I shall not go into details, but you get the drift it is damn uncomfortable, and something you would like to forget.What if you are given a chance for revenge? That is, you manage to successfully hunt down, and capture one alive. What will you do? For this group, it is a gleeful payback time, or so they thought. And this is where the movie begins to develop into a snoozefest, with bad, uninspiring dialogue, and even worse acting. Even if it is low budgeted, there are not many redeeming factors, be it strength of storyline, or any help from the cast in making their characters just a tad interesting. It is the standard cardboard fare from a vanilla plain script, coupled with some cheap scare tactics employed.What is good though is the makeup. Much effort has been put into making some of the stuff which I shall not mention, because thatll spoil just the few elements of what makes this movie tolerable. Other than that, there are the usual cheap special effects, blood and gory moments which is nothing you have never seen before.Watch this only as a last resort.

The silliness is not funny. The horror and gore is not scary. And whatever thinking aspect some poor fellows saw in this movie were due to severe delusions because there is certainly nothing profound or smart about this mess.OK, so we know nothing stands out. Is it at least bearable? Is the experience worthwhile in any way? Unfortunately, no. For starters, get very poor acting. It is not a stretch to say most Bmovies these days feature better acting. The plot? Boring and messy. Dialogs? Many amateurs actually do better.It is really the direction that puzzles. I did not expect major improvements over Blair Witch but at least small steps forward. Instead, our director seems to have worsen over time, completely oblivious to previous experiences.If there is a major flaw in Altered, it is the main set. A major part of the plot takes place in a single location, where the main characters are confined but S\u00e1nchez has failed to give the place any personality whatsoever. Considering that in Blair Witch, the forest plays a major part and is as much a character an antagonist, if you will as the three students, you would think the director would realize the same thing was needed here. But no... this place has no personality whatsoever thanks to sloppy direction and no attention to details.There is nothing salvageable here. Die hard fans of Blair Witch are better off following Daniel Myrick. Although his output is far from being golden, it shows better structure than S\u00e1nchez and some lessons from Blair Witch are applied unfortunately, in weak stories but still.","label":0},{"index":8806,"txt":"After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb I was very enthusiastic about this movie.

Then the girlfriend, who is acting is the most over the top, wants to walk away from this madness, then suddenly she does not, then again, she does and then she does not. Then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien will kill the whole human race and remember, in all those years no other human have seen these permanently settled aliens and what do they do?

There was no tension, the characters, how was I supposed to care about them? They had no development whatsoever, the killer?! Oh, my God, this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed, I know it is a film, but why would a man who neveror at least we know of killed any one before, kill a girls family and friends that he is just obsessed over? I mean, was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her? I have no idea, because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror.Donnas family was just brutally murdered by her teacher, who has become very obsessed over her, he was captured and put in jail. It is been 3 years and she is just now getting some peace in her life, she is even going to her senior prom. But the killer has escaped and still has Donna on his mind, he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends, and the hotel maid, and the bell boy, because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employees are. Donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses unnoticed and can kill people so silently, just, wow.I am sorry, I really did want to love this movie, we have not had a good slasher flick in a long time, but this was just a stupid movie that I was not impressed with. Just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious. I know that this was a PG13 movie, but I just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes? Not to mention no stab holes?

I do not care if ten million people call it a crap movie, the poster looks awesome so I guess I will just have to see it \u0085 Now, The Hazing can somewhat be described like its alternate title curious! The poster and title make it sound like a genuine horror movie set on campus and dealing with sinister initiation rites, but this movie is actually more of a crossbreed between comedy and thriller. First of all, there is something very wrong with the tagline on the old VHS box I watched. It says He had good grades, a good girl and good buddies \u0085 until they put him through the Hazing. That is not the case, actually. Protagonist Gilbert Lewis is finally accepted by an acclaimed campus through an athletics scholarship. It takes over half the movie before we even hear about his girlfriend back home and the only buddy he has is a very nerdy Charles Martin Smith still with hair in this film. Both of them are approached to become members of the prestigious Delts fraternity, but during their hazing exam \u0096 in which they have to descend a mountain dressed in their tidy white undies \u0096 Barney falls off a cliff and breaks his leg. When Lewis returns with the other frat boys, Barney froze to death already. Together they intended to keep the body frozen for five days and then claim he never returned from a weekend skitrip. With Barneys body hidden in the cafeteria freezer, Lewis has to cover for him so that Barneys absence does not look suspicious. The setup of The Hazing is quite original and potentially innovative, but the problem here is that the execution could easily have been a lot better. The tone is too steady and too serious for a comedy movie, even a black one, but on the other hand there are not any proper attempts to build up suspense or thrills, neither. The soundtrack is cheerful and full of lightheaded tunes, but that is nearly not enough to make this film a comedy. Around an hour into the film, the plot also runs out of steam and idea, and the makers have no better alternative to fill up the emptiness with romantic compilations of Lewis and his outer town girlfriend biking through the countryside. I did not like the final twist, because it is quite implausible and because it has been done numerous times before and after though admittedly after.

When a movie is this bad you might as well just turn it into softcore porn, but instead I get to see some pasty white dude blocking me from seeing Wuhrers body and scenes that offer me nothing except a tease. They should have just gone cinemax so that the movie was not a complete waste of time, but no. With a script this awful they should have capitalized on Wuhrers looks, since that is the lone pro of the movie. 210, only because she looked so hot.","label":0},{"index":8827,"txt":"There are Spoilers Homicidal nymphomaniac hooker Miya, Kari Wuhrer,takes over the life and car of 18 virgin, even though he is too embarrassed to admit it, collage freshmen Trent Colbert, Kristoffer Ryan. By the end of the movie Myia not only deflowers but give poor innocent and naive Trent a lesson in how to spot a dangerous nut job and keep as far away for him, or her,in order to keep from ending up turning into one. Hanging around a trucker reststop Miya is picked up by Roy, Burt Young, for some hot and heavy action, in the back seat of his buggy. Roy is either too drunk or stupid to realize that Miya is non other then his estranged daughter! Outraged that Miya is reluctant to get it on with him Roy almost strangles her to death only to be interrupted by first year collage student Trent Colbert who plows into the restarea side swiping one of the truckers. Seeing her chance Miya jumps into Trents car and the two are off in what turns out to be the weirdest car chase ever put into a movie. Going all across the North Eastern USA the two end up involved in a truck car smashup a murder and a shootout with the state troopers that then leads to Trents parents home, with them being held hostage. It is there that there is another wild shootout between the crazed Miya with an entire SWAT team reinforced by the local police and state troopers. You would expect a movie like Hit and Run to be intentionally or unintentionally funny but it is not. In fact the film is very disturbing in how Miya treats everyone in the film that she comes in contact with even her perverted and childmolesting father Roy. Getting Trent to drive her all over the NorthEast Miya gets the poor slob drunk having it on with him in a motel room, together with whips handcuffs and a lighted candle. Miya also gets it on with the motel owner the horny Mr. Foster by tricking him into giving her his gun, as being part of some weird sex game. After holding Foster up she takes off with Trents, who out cold in his motel room, wallet with some 400.00 in it yet does not bother to drive away with his car. Needing the money to pay for gas to get home to his parents for Thanksgiving Trent gets a call on his cellphone from Miya to pick her up at a local diner to get his money back. Like the jerk that he is Trent picks up Miya, who is now a fugitive from he law, and later gets involved with her father Roy on the open highway as he tries to run both Trent  Miya off the road. The chase ends up in this deserted wearhouse that Roy chases Miya,out running him on a muddy road in highheels, into with him getting it in the you know where with a blast from his own shotgun. Roy was so busy trying to take his pants off that he forgot he left the gun unattended. With both a holdup and murder, as well as a hit and run, charge against them the two desperadoes stop off at a SMTattoo boutique where Trent gets his ear and nose pierced and is dressed up in leather and chains, by Myri, together with a matching his and hers dog collar. This in order to meet his straightlaced and conservative parents for Thanksgiving Dinner. Having a running shootout with the state troopers, with one of them ending up badly injured,the two fugitives from the law end up at Trents parents Mr  Mrs Colbet, David Keith  Elaine Martyn home with the entire local police force, with a SWAT team, waiting for them there. Obnoxious movie with a truly disturbing final ending that made you wonder what exactly the movie was trying,if at all, to tell it is audience. You felt a lot of sympathy for Miya at first but as the movie rolled along to it is downbeat ending that evaporated as fast as a tray of ice cubs in Death Valley. Even though Roy was the most unlikable person in the movie at first by the time the film ended Miya totally eclipsed him.","label":0},{"index":8828,"txt":"Crazed Shotgun totingincest drivenrevenge seeking truck drivers  obsessive control disorder daddy raped me when I was 12 handcuff carrying, all latex wearing prostitutes is just a few of the character you will be introduced to in this complete disgrace of a movie that can easily be viewed on any cable TV station IE Skinemax at 4am on Sunday nights. \u0085And yes I know that was an entire sentence, but bare with me people; this is a longwinded review for a short pointless film.Filmed in somewhere Canada, with almost no budget, the plot to this freak show is trite, the police in it obviously never heard of State Jurisdiction because they end up chasing both Miya Hookers and Trent idiotic, Anal Retentive, Generic, insecure College Student all across the U.S. and I thought only the FBI could do that. The camera is shaky, the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so bad it might actually cause unintentional acid flashbacks to movies like Ishtar and Leonard Part 6.As far as the Skin scenes go which is the only reason to even rent this movie, do not even think of buying it there are two of them. The first one is the only one worth watching though which is the Dominatrix Sex scene with Kari Salin and ____insert unknown actor here, he is obviously done nothing else worth noting in a seedy, disgusting Motel room the kind with the busted sink that drips, and the soda machine outside that only has blue tonic water left in it. It is all SM riding crops, handcuffs, hot wax, and underwear licking folks and in the end, he gets left in a motel room, with no money and cops waiting at his door that is goes to show you guys, do not let a hooker tie you up in a middleofnowhere motel room. Sadly though, Kari shows no skin worth remembering, and that alone can cause deepseeded traumatic experiences for some gentlemen, so that is definitely a downer towards this flick.As for the ending, SnickerSnicker I know you probably would not mind if I revealed it to you but I will not, you should spend your hard earned money for that one.

I can really get into a good art house film, even a surreal and twisted romp like El Topo, Naked Lunch, and Survive Style 5, because those movies actually have something worth discussing when the credits roll.FFFC attempts at every avenue to be this deep and intellectual, essentially there is no substance in this movie. This movie is badly done, the visuals in this movie are not inspiring, the dialog is worse, the musical numbers destroy this movie.. I chuckled for GUITAR BROTHERS, but that was immediately wiped out by something completely unnecessary, and irrelevant. It attempted to be deep and meaningful I think, but its just pretentious disoriented nonsense. Freshman film students without a camera could craft something more interesting.Guitar Brothers and the stand up routines in between skits get 1 point each, everything else is just badly paced, pseudocreative, heavy handed attempts at being AS good as films by other REAL directors like, Sogo Ishii, David Lynch, and Jodoworsky. Give me a break. I am convinced that people that rave about FFFC are doing so because they have no idea of what they saw, because it was nothing but mild pertinent statements here and there mixed with stupidity and blended until you puke on your own shoes.This movie was an extreme disappointment, coming off the high that was Survive Style 5, a film that actually has meaning, combined with excellent use of scenery, cinematography, catchy dialog, funny moments, good soundtrack, excellent performances, fantastic pacing and flow. FFFC features the exact opposite in every way, boring scenery 20 minutes staring at a bland beach at night? a completely white stage? Alien balls floating in white space? a dinky school hallway and then a... school hallway?, terrible cinematography, forgettable dialog, nothing funny or humorous, save the fact you just wasted your life for two hours, soundtrack?, amateurish performances, uneven, disjointed, and often flat out dragging pacing, zero flow whatsoever.There are those that claim this is what makes FFFC a great movie, that it is so unconventional at every turn that its pure genius. This is simply a way to stroke your own ego it seems, because unpredictable could be a good quality for a film if it was not coupled with boring, innane, and terrible. Personally I have spoken with two people who admitted to me that FFFC was terrible when they left the theater, but overwhelming rave by arthouse elitist made them watch the movie again and then come back to me with a... Hey it was pretty good I liked it.I am going to put my foot down, this movie is slop, I do not care if Roger Ebert says this film is the best thing he is ever watched since he lost his own virginity. The Emperors new cloak I say... this movie is no way indicative of the other psychedelictrippy films to come from Japan in the last 10 years. Taste of Tea, Party 7, and Kamikaze Girls are much better movies even with a low budget, and none can honestly compare with Survive Style 5. Watch FFFC only if your interested in making a pretentious pile of nothing on a shoestring budget.","label":0},{"index":8830,"txt":"Algie, the Miner is one bad and unfunny silent comedy.

Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development. I know they often lack in horror movies, but Prom Night looked like it did not even put forth ANY effort in that department. Next, we all love suspense. That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. Yeah, Prom Night had none of that! Of course, we like a terrifying killer. Prom Night have that? Nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil knife. And when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated PG13 like Prom Night, they leave that stuff out too. So with all of these elements missing, I ask....does this still count as a horror movie? Nope. I would call it more of a comedy. People in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when I saw SemiPro that was supposed to actually be a comedy which also sucked, but thats another story!. I think I am just going to have to give up on new horror. All the good horror movies of the good ol days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money.

Fortunately Ed is here to teach neohippies in the art of envirojudgementalism.Here you will learn the art of wagging your finger in the face of anyone without losing your trademark smirk. You will learn how to shrug off logic and science with powerful arguments of fear. You will learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you by labeling it as the gateway to planetary Armageddon.In addition to learning how to lie with a straight face you will also learn how to shrug off accusations that are deflected your way no matter how much of a hypocrite you are. You will be able to use as much energy as Al Gore yet while having people treat you as if you were Amish.In the second season was even more useful as we were able to visit other Hollywood Gods, holy be thy names, and audit  i.e. judge  their lifestyles.

I just think the filmmakers misgauged which road to take when they made this they should have added more funny bits if they wanted it to be a comedy. With a rewrite, it could have been a great film.

Orlando, Florida seems to becoming a more recognized filmmaking area like Vancouvers rise to prominance. The Brothers was shot in Central Florida and this short film is a bit of a setback for the area which made great strides with the Indie film Walking Across Africa and the great HBO miniseries From Earth To The Moon.I will try to be as honest as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place to film The Brothers. It had the potential to give a new spin on the Boy Band craze. After all, both NSync and the Backstreet Boys come from this area. But, The Brothers falls short probably because of a weak script. Both lead characters are flat with almost no development part of this could be the amatuer actors, but some of it is certainly the way the script was written.Also a problem is the choice of jokes. Many of the jokes are too repetitive they do come off funny the first time, but it does grow to be a bit boring. Some of the concert scenes are staged poorly and many of these scenes also do not seem to move the story along in any way.I had high hopes for this one, but alas its a disappointing effort. I also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this short. But I think the best thing for filmmaker John Figg is to move to different genres quickly. Comedy is not his strong suit.

Its director, Joe Wright, has already authored a best picture candidate. The leading actor, Robert Downey Jr., starred in a widely praised superhero film. Finally, the movie itself is a drama. When it was mysteriously pulled from release in late 2008, filmgoers and critics were baffled. Now that I have seen it, I assure you Universal did not just delay this film to promote Iron ManOscar buzz. The Soloist is a weak drama with no external conflict that is vastly inferior to any 2009 best picture candidates.Downey and costar Jamie Fox are not to be blamed for this mishap. Joe Wright is largely at fault but even he cannot save a Lifetime story. Many movies are too complex and alienate viewers. This one is unusually simple. It is a movie about a newspaper reporter, Steve Lopez Downey, who befriends a homeless musician, Nathaniel Ayers Jamie Fox. That is it. Ayers is schizophrenic and does not resonate with Lopezs traditional approach to friendship. The two become friends. They begin this movie as acquaintances and are BFFs by its end. Tension consists of moments like this will Ayers let Lopez take him to the homeless shelter? This material would have been better suited as a madeforTV production rather than a feature film.Wright includes many scenes of cheap humor to obscure the lack of content. Lopez battles yarddefiling raccoons in what I consider a subplot. Do you remember when this happened in Atonement or Pride and Prejudice? Those films were structured enough to permit an occasional joke but nothing so prolonged. Ayers back story is fleshed out when it does not need to be. Worst of all, these scenes are not connected and appear at random intervals. It is a way of admitting that the main story carries little appeal. Nathaniel was a violin prodigy with a tough upbringing I was too. This is a fabricated attempt to create sympathy with Ayers when most of us already have it. He is a homeless schizophrenic for crying out loud! The movie somewhat conveys humanitys love for music, like Amadeus and Beethoven Lives Upstairs. It is not as effective as either of those pictures, however. The entire film is hinged on Ayers schizophrenia. It ultimately is how he interacts with everyone else. His being a musician is a nice touch but hardly worth including. The film does not incorporate this characteristic fully into his persona. Take music out of Amadeus or Beethoven Lives Upstairs, and no film remains. The Soloist is more about friendship in general than music. Nathaniel could be a writer or film critic and few lines of dialog would need to be seriously altered.This is only Joe Wrights third film, and his first that is not a romance staring Keira Knightley. Let us hope this film is not an indication of how limited his abilities are. There are stylistic nods to his earlier works but The Soloist is much weaker than either of them. In his defense, Universal should not have agreed to widely release this picture. This film seems tailored for Imagine Entertainment distributors of Changeling.

The Stones idea of nailbiting tension is to trap the hysterical Stevens alone with Benzedrinepopping rapist Neville Brand, filling the frame with his sweaty, drooling kisser. But the camera work is so leaden and Brand so uncharacteristically demure that the effect is hardly lurid, much less suspenseful. The Stones, a square pair at heart, do not even have the courage of their own lack of convictions.The film, which ends with the portly Steiger chasing the fleetfooted Stevens on a subway train track, is as clumsy as its ungainly heavy.

Other than that, it is a sadly routine slasher film that throws in an innovative concept about murder clubs, which ends up being fake anyway. So, the whole movie then points in another direction to try to be confusing and this huge mystery, but it all just adds up to not being interesting at all and leaves you feeling like you do not care for any of the characters.

Perhaps the psychopath is newly hired MaddyDabbie Rochon, an attractive, raven haired beauty with a troubled family past, plagued with nightmares. Shawn and his friends play a practical joke on Maddy, concerning a supposed Murder Club they started where each member randomly selected a victim to kill. When Maddy accidentally murders a woman in a parking garage because of a dent put into her car by this person, she finds that Shawns pals were jerking her chain. But, Shawn and his comrades are concerned about Maddys admittance towards committing the murder and contemplate turning her into the proper authorities. Deciding to wait on a definite decision, each member fall prey to the whitemasked psycho with Maddy a suspect considering the fact that she already has killed before. Or, is someone else behind these murders? Low budget slasher, executive produced by Charles Band, with gore murders that fail to convince. Plenty of tits on display and Allen Nabors goofy character Chris might entertain those with low expectations. The murders include a stomach being opened with intestines showing, a neck sliced, an electrical cord thrown into a pool frying a female victim who had all day to escape, an ax buried into the back of a male victim, and, to top it all, a couple are strangled by a rope during their sexual climax..for added effect, the killer uses the breaker bar of a socket wrench as extra leverage to twist the rope as tight as possible snapping their necks. There are enough plot holes to drive a truck through, such as why Maddy has nightmares of murders she did not commit, how she could murder someone so violently..with blood all over herwinding up waking in her bed without leaving something at the scene of the crime that would easily implicate her, and how Shawn could go so long, allowing her to continue working at the company despite what she told regarding the murder she committed, and a continual desire to join the supposed club that does not exist.What bothered me the most was the films desire for having us somehow sympathizing with this female protagonist who wanted to join a club after killing someone, later proclaiming it to be an accident. The film builds Maddy as the potential psycho throughout because of her past. Her family disowned her for an abortion. She has blackouts and always appropriately winds up at the scenes of crimes after the fact. In a lot of slashers, the one who seems the most likely killer is often the red herring, but this film goes out of it is way to point the finger at Maddy. When the twist occurs, we are left rooting for Maddy, yet we know she is not right in the head. It is a tough sell caring for this chick. She does look great in a mans Army shirt, though. And, Rochon is not afraid to let her puppies breathe, either. Low budget horror fans will get a kick out of seeing cult favorite Brinke Stevens as a religious fanatical mother who preaches against what Maddy did, calling her a murderer as beloved Troma producer Lloyd Kaufman is the aloof father who can not get in a word edgewise to protect the daughter he truly cares about.

Sadly, his arrival to this independent studio happened in a time when budget and production values are at its lowest in years. However, in his short career Hamilton has established himself as a creative director that manages to make inventive and original stories. Now, this does not mean that his movies are good, but at least they are different to the usual in the horror genre.In his debut, Bleed, Hamilton presents us a creative twist on the slasher sub genre. Maddy Debbie Rochon is a young woman that finally gets the job of her dreams. Not only that, but it seems that she has also found a boyfriend in Shaun Danny Wolske, it seems that life finally smiles for Maddy after many sad events. Until on a party with Shauns friends, they tell her that they created a club where members have to kill somebody to enter.Obviously they are joking, but Maddy wants desperately to fit in, that she actually murders someone. After that event, someone starts to kill the rest of the members of the club one by one. it is up to Maddy to figure out what is going on as anybody could be the killer, including her.Maddy is a very interesting character wonderfully played by the beautiful Debbie Rochon. It is a very interesting twist on the genre to have the lead actress as part of the suspects. The concept is so original and Rochons performance is so good that it is a real shame that Hamilton did not develop the whole story a little bit better. The movie feels quite slow at times and overall the feeling is the one of a good idea wasted on a bad movie.The rest of the cast is weird in the sense that all the female cast is very good, while the male cast is painfully bad. Danny Wolske is terribly wooden and his performance as a yuppie is quite stereotypical. Julie Strain, Brinke Stevens  Lloyd Kaufman appear in small cameos and are wonderful in their small roles. Also, there is lots of nudity both male  female and the cast is very good looking, so it is really a plus.The lowbudget hurts the film in the effects department, as there are very few gory scenes and are not really graphic probably because they would look bad; nevertheless, considering the budget, the film at least looks good.Hamiltons more recent effort, the sexploitational venture Delta Delta Die!, is a better crafted and overall funnier film.

The team behind this one also worked on Delta Delta Die! and Birth Rite  both equally bland by Full Moon standards. Debbie Rochon is on usual top form here as a newbie to a gang of dudes and dudettes who decide to make up a story about a murder club.

Other than Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress I had seen before, in the similar Delta Delta Die.The plot centers around a group of California arrogants who initiate poor naive Debbie Rochon into their clique. They tell her that they have a murder club, and that she must kill someone to be accepted. Debbie wants nothing more but to be accepted by these cool people, so she quickly kills a person, and now the group must decide what to do with her, after she fell for their joke.VIOLENCE  Plentiful! Debbie Rochon occasionally has blood splattered all over her and all of the murder scenes are done in your face. Gore hounds will surely enjoy!NUDITY  Plentiful as well! Debbie Rochon has several nude scenes as do many of the noname actresses and actors. The pool party seems as just an excuse to get everyone naked; man and woman alike. Julie Strain also has a topless cameo but her character is gone after the first five minutes.STORY  Could have received a higher vote because the plot was very interesting and unique but the plot serves as filler between nude scenes. I understand that BRate films use nudity often, but this is borderline excessive.ACTING  The acting is sub standard to say the least.

Yeah, there were continuity errors about mainly with ms. Rochons everchanging wardrobe, but for an indie slasher it is not that bad.

As a person who bought this DVD under the impression that I would be getting a proper cinematic product, i.e. a film, I feel deeply disappointed. It is a videotaped TV play, something along the line of old sixties serials, but without that certain charm. Aside from the leading man Mr Redfield who also is the director, the other actors seem to be either chaps from the campus a bit too old for that actually, or members of the directors household, who appear before the camera without any help from not only the acting couches, but also the makeup artist or hairdresser a bonnet over outgrown permanent bangs or a top hat over mullet is a very long way from creating 1840s. It is all shot using a motionless mounted camera in a small, bare studio, sometimes using blue screen for outdoors backgrounds. Synthesizer generated uninspired score of lame period inspired romantic karaoke insults the viewers ears on more than one occasion. The film attempts to be dreamlike, whereas in fact it is merely conceptionless collage of those shots that made it to the editing and believe me, the standards were not too high to start with. There are interesting dialogs every now and then, but overall it is pretty lame and twodimensional production in more than one way with no flashes of genius from either the director or any members of the crew.

Natural Born Killers is a risky, mad, all out filmmaking that we do not get very often; strange, psychotic, artistic pictures.Natural Born Killers is basically the story of how two mass killers were popularised and glorified by the media; there is a great scene where an interviewer questions some teenagers about Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager says Murder is wrong.... but If I was a mass murderer I would be Mickey and Mallory. Mickey describes this with a situation of Frankenstein the monster and Dr. Frankenstein  Dr. Frankenstein is the media who has turned them into these monstrous killersMost Oliver Stone films examine the flaws of the America, the country that the director loves and admires. I guess Natural Born Killers is about the effect of mass media, technology and how obsessive as a nation, Americans are and most of the world over things such as mass killers and bizarre situations.The killers played by Woody Harrelson Mickey and Juliette Lewis Mallory are executed astonishingly by two excellent actors who step into the lives of two interestingly brutal killers. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people are worthy of killing, perhaps in the cruel theory of Social Darwinism survival of the fittest  Mickey says in his interview in prison, that other species commit murder, we as humans ravage other species and exploit the environment; the script is interesting, but it is questionable how much this film amounts to, in the sense of making us think about society and human behaviour, rather than the intensity of a 2 hour bloodbath that we have seen.The last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison; we see the harsh realities of prison life; the attitudes of the warden etc;overfilling of prisons  maybe Stone is questioning the future, the path that society is leading to.Two other interesting characters; First, a reporter who runs a show about Americas Maniacs and is obsessed with boosting ratings, that he goes to any length to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. The other is police officer Scagnetti, an insane, perhaps sadistic officer that is in love with Mallory  he also has some weird obsession with mass killers, since his mother was killed during the massacre at Waco, Texas by Charles Whitman.The cinematography is superb; different colours, shadows, styles create a feeling of disorientation; the green colour most evident of all is green, to resemble the sickness of the killers in the drugstore when they are looking for rattlesnake antidote.The camera work is insane; shaky, buzzy, it takes some determination to get use to it and accept it. Highly unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual.Natural Born Killers does not glamourise the existence of insane murderers, it questions it and how we as the public may fuel this attribute...Although the above review sound quite positive, I did dislike the film. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the script for the film, was not pleased with the altered screenplay and he asked for his name to be removed. I can see why. While mildly interesting at times, Natural Born Killers is a mess of a picture.410","label":0},{"index":8904,"txt":"Spoilers Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is brilliant criticism of the media obsession with violence. But this contention ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious, inhuman murderers of innocent people and contrasted this with a morbid media fascination. Instead he lends them justification. The movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt. Engaging in vicious stereotyping, Stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures  dumb rednecks, brokenEnglish speaking immigrants, lazy fat people. The one person that the homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype. Of course they befriend the old, hallucinogenusing AmericanIndian  because they are trendy, dude? Let us make him an admirable character. Fat, Chinese clerks and hicks are uncool, so let us make it seem like the deserve to die. Instead of twisted,hateful that are corrupted by their misdeeds, their rampage makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are bound to entice more impressionable people. Justice is mocked. The police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and scowling compared to the GQ murderers. Again, this is not in the media reports within the film but in the reality in the film. There is no nuance or subtlety in the film  just overblown performances and visuals. The film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. The proof that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reactions to it. Some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for murders that they committed. The films message is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous reallife results. The clever message is nowhere to be seen.","label":0},{"index":8905,"txt":"You probably heard this phrase when it come to this movie \u0096 Herbie Fully Loaded with crap and yes it is true.

Earlier Herbie installments although cheesy as well were produced during more serious times, making them a little easier to digest. Ms. Lohan, Disneys reigning drama queen, has little acting ability. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon would get involved in such a project. Only the snack bar, was a bigger ripoff!","label":0},{"index":8911,"txt":"There are few uplifting things to say about this, but I can mention Matt Dillon doing his best to make something out of nothing and the many split screens and graphics that are worthwhile. As most race movies suffer from the premise that car lovers are not that intelligent, we end up with movies like this.Lindsay Lohan who surprised so much in Mean Girls has to make better decisions which roles to take. Here she can only fail.Children will only be mildly entertained because it tries to appeal more to adults than children although still pretty dumb. The ones in the theater I saw it with showed no real interest after a couple of minutes. And as a family sports movie this is horrible. The better moments are in the beginning at the scrapyard creating some sentiment and later in the carbash fest creating some tension. If you develop a car as a central character you have to develop it better than here. After a few obligatory race scenes you are in for the best part being able to leave the multiplex in your own car.","label":0},{"index":8912,"txt":"So, back when Herbie made his first appearance, I was perfectly happy watching Dean Jones mug away. I only wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat overly buttered popcorn. Now, unfortunately, I have expectations of a rivetingdelightful story whenever I watch a movie, if I am not on some sort of medication. And this is another good movie for the medicated. There are no major laughs, no complex plot lines, no difficult twists. Herbie Fully Loaded is great for the fully loaded.This was the first time I had seen La Lohan on the screen since she swapped places with Jamie Lee Curtis I thought she was excellent in that, and I cannot say I was terribly impressed this time around. Aside from her constantly changing and distractingly unnatural hair color, she just did not ring true as the kid next door who had spent a lifetime hanging around road racers. Her need for speed was not portrayed consistently in the film  perhaps it was elsewhere  she looked older than her part, and seemed to always be looking for something a party? designer togs? new place to spend money? off set. I could not see any chemistry with Justin Long; that romance seemed obligatory at best. The only time Lindsay appeared engaged was when she was interacting with Matt Dillon, who I thought was appropriately over the top as Evil Bad Guy Trip Murphy.It was great to see Herbie again, and I loved the movie intro with material from the old movies. If Disney had popped out with some Car 53 jewelry, I might have worn some just to be loyal. His new feature ? was a little inconsistent does he channel the thoughts of his driver? Does he now skateboard? but whatever. We all knew how it was going to end, but I do wish he had ended up with someone a little less dopey than Maggie. And my head still hurts from that lesson Maggie and we viewers had hammered home. What would have made the movie worthwhile? Have the old Herbie in a real story with a real plot  at the very least, Herbies as good as Lassie  but clearly that is asking too much. Why is it that Disney always goes back to the same well as Herbie Goes Bananas and the Computer That Wore Tennis Shoes when it comes to innovation? I am sure this was a great movie for kids and those with no expectations. For the rest of us....it is for when you have the flu and just cannot take the suspense of Rear Window.","label":0},{"index":8913,"txt":"One of the most common entries in the goofs category is anachronism. Though I am beginning to believe that anachronism and other goofs are more acceptable, even ignored, in very good films, but are found front and center in rotten films. KISS THEM FOR ME is a rotten film and reeks of anachronism, yet when watching it closely, I found almost nothing specifically anachronistic.The shots of aircraft which bookend the film are certainly out of place. The big 4 engine transport seen after the title Honolulu 1944 appears to be the post war C97 Stratofreighter in MATS colors. The combat planes seen taking off from the carrier at the end are Douglas Skyraiders which entered service after WW2 and were made famous by their service in Vietnam.But excepting these two pieces of film and, of course, the hairstyles, everything else is very possibly period authentic. It just feels so wrong. I am an admirer of Stanley Donen, we share the same birthday. In his co directed ON THE TOWN 1949 there is a car chase at the end with the police driving 194950 Fords yet there is not the slightest feeling that this is out of place in a WW2 period film. In fact, as I reflected later, there is not anything which says that this is supposed to be a WW2 period film. It just feels that way. Based on a wartime Broadway musical which was based on a ballet Fancy Free which may have been based on the work of artist Paul Cadmus The Fleets In! 1934 its a great film about sailors on a 24 hour pass in New York and, so heavy with wartime associations, its merely assumed it takes place during the war and yet these contemporary cars do nothing to break the spell.The first problem is old Cary Grant. Though far too old to represent a Navy SBD dive bomber pilot, it is a Hollywood tradition for stars like Grant, Gary Cooper Lou Gehrig, Jimmy Stewart Charles Lindbergh to play younger. It was the role which he is miscast in, not his age. He plays an operator, as they used to call them. A guy who gets things done and breaks all the rules while doing it yet remains admired and loved for it. A hustler. A wheeler dealer. A de rigueur character in a service comedy. Grant is the comic center of what is after all supposed to be a service comedy which is contra to his comedy style.Thinking back on the great Grant comic performances like BRINGING UP BABY 1938 or ARSENIC AND OLD LACE 1944 and he is the great reactor whose comedy is to be reduced by his context from dignity to a befuddled puddle of inert jelly. IN KISS THEM he is expected to be the comic spark plug which just is not him. People had already been exposed to the type, most recently to comic Phil Silvers as Sgt. Bilko on television. The role would be perfected later by James Garner but here Grant just is not funny and appears to be a bully getting his way by aggressively pushing his Cary Grantness rather than cajoling and finessing.But the thing which really stinks the place up with anachronism is the lead women. There can be no more echt 50s women than Suzy Parker and Jayne Mansfield. They are unique to the decade. Marilyn Monroe can be placed in a continuum with Carole Lombard and Marie Wilson and any number of dumb blonds, and Grace Kelly was another high class dame think of Mary Astor, but there never could have been an anatomically exaggerated woman in films like Mansfield. Sure there were the sweater girls e.g. Lana Turner of WW2, but Mansfield was stretching the point. Suzy Parker was THE model who revolutionized the model business, who changed the mannequin like poses to become the first natural girl who moved and whose personality was captured by the camera see FUNNY FACE 1957 also by Stanley Donen.Of course in high 50s style, there seems to be a lot of gender mixing at wild parties but never even a hint of sex think of the 50s TV shows Bachelor Father or The Bob Cummings Show where dinner jacketed men returned from dates alone. The original book, which I have not read, was published during the war and appeared as a play on Broadway at the end of the war and the nuances of the situation must have been inescapable for contemporary readers and audiences, but broken down, bowdlerized and reconstituted a dozen years later and fatally miscast, it remains a once forgotten stain on otherwise exemplary careers until the invention of the VCR and cable television resurrected this petrified turkey.So the lesson here is whatever the goof it will be ignored in a great film like CITIZEN KANE who actually hears Charles Foster Kane say Rosebud?, and tolerated in fun dreck like WESTWORLD  why were the robots given live ammunition in the first place? but absolutely despised in a rotten film, even if the goofs are really non existent.","label":0},{"index":8914,"txt":"As an avid fan of Cary Grant, I expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter, as AMC billed it as a comedy. I have never been more disappointed with a film! Carys usual charm and effortless comedy are AWOL from this entire movie; he comes across as strained, bored, and just not himself. Mississips character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes I have ever witnessed  his accent is terribly exaggerated and incorrect, according to which part of Mississippi he claims to hail from, and whenever he does deliver a line, it is several decibels higher than any other cast member. Mississip tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable, countrybumpkin goofball, but in the end, he manages only to detract from the already weak plot. Mansfield looks more like an obscene blowup doll than a Hollywood sex kitten, and while she was never known in Hollywood for her acting ability, this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with. Ray Walstons character was sugary and ultimately contrived. For four men on shore leave, it was the tamest leave I have ever seen. I watched this nightmare until its very end, and while I will not spoil that for anyone, I will tell you that it is the most absurd you will ever see. The film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men, but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast.

It is the sort of film that has me wondering two things  when did all involved including some wellknown names realize they had a turkey on their hands, and what is the worst thing about it among a number of contending aspects? Still pondering the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the meandering storyline, ahead of the wordy sometimes pretentious script, the uncertain tone, the lack of consistent and welldeveloped characterization, and the lack of rapport between the characters. You have to add very uneven acting to the criticism but it is understandable that the actors were struggling with this stuff and in addition seem underrehearsed. Quite often they can hardly get their lines out quick enough. Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and urbane persona but at times seems uneasy and staccato in his delivery. I have to say however that I was relieved when the initial suggestions his character will be paired with the unspeakably vulgar Jayne Mansfield go away with the appearance of Suzy Parker. What is to like about the film?  for me chiefly the beauty of Parker who also acts with restraint and a Grace Kellylike dignity. Generally speaking the film is nice to look at. The naval characters are very smart in their uniforms  however you have to truly wonder at the ghastly black Fu Manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite. Even Grant cannot look elegant in his.

Gorgeous and in fine dramatic form. Jayne? Adorable, endearing, and obviously having a ball. The supporting cast does alright, and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its stunning, retro elegance.Then you see Suzy Parker attempting to speak her lines with a woodenness, a deadness, a cluelessness that simply defies belief.

KISS HER FOR ME, overall, just seemed like a cheaper filmwith poor writing, little energy and some VERY broad performanceseven when compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT. I think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting Jayne Mansfield. The combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this Abudget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio. Plus, there was not much chemistry or energy in pairing her with Cary Grantan actor generally loved for his grace and class.

After solid turns in Girl Cannot Help It, Wayward Bus, The Burglar and Rock Hunter it seemed Jayne was well on the way to becoming one of Tinsel Towns hottest stars. However, an obsession with racy publicity and an appearance in this clunker relegated Mansfield to the sidelines, namely cheap Euro loanouts until Fox could drop her contract at the earliest opportunity.This movie really is a diabolical waste of everyones time with the exception of Suzy Parker who is the only thing in this movie bad enough for the material. Many people blame poor Jayne and her grating performance for this films poor returns at the box office and while she is a pain in this film, she can only do her best with the material. After all, Cary hardly sets the screen on fire does he? After a handful of very good dramatic and comedy turns Jayne takes 10 steps back in her pursuit as a serious actress by agreeing simply for the sake of appearing with Grant to portray this squealing, idiotic menace. Her character of Alice is a complete cartoon bimbo and although she looks good enough to eat in a boiler suit, her every appearance in the film jangles your nerves. We all know Jayne could do so much better than this dross and yet here she is parading around like a prize pudding. A real shame.Steer clear of this socalled comedy.

Those expectations are buoyed further when the film is directed by Stanley Donen, whose comic touch was so evident in, among others, DAMN YANKEES!, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. For the first five minutes, or so, it seems that those expectations might be met and then\u0085. Nothing. What is supposed to be a light comedy, plunges into leaden, heavy handed melodrama, with nary a chuckle to be had.Relative newcomer Suzy Parker has often been criticized for her performance, or lack of one, in this film, but in a movie in which even the great Cary Grant frequently appears flat and wooden, attacking Parker seems unfair. Not even as bright a light as an Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day could have changed the fortunes of this meandering, dreary and wholly pointless script, which drags itself lamely along and drags the viewers interest and patience down with it.The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, keep trying to breath some life into the proceedings, but the horrible script is beyond resuscitation.

It was based on a novel which was later turned into a playwhich flopped on Broadway. The story is about some navy officers on leave in San Francisco during WWII. They have 4 days leave which they spend at the Mark Hopkins hotel. The film meanders a lot and none of the characters seem very real. Cary Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and dramabut here he plays a sort of wheeler dealer and he does not really pull it off. Tony Curtis or James Garner would have been better choices. Audrey Hepburn was initially set to play opposite Grant, but had other commitmentsso Suzy parker stepped in. She had never acted before, but was Americas top photographic model at the time. I think that she did a good job, considering all the pressure that she was under. Grants pairing with Jayne Mansfield in a few brief scenesdid not really work.

The only thing about this movie that is not delightful is Suzy Parkers onenote performance as Grants love interest, which takes up too much of the films time and slows down the pace in the second half.

Dudley Moore and Laraine Newman are on a bus tour of the Holy Land, when they stumble across an ancient scroll in a cave. There they read the story of Herschel and Zerelda, also played by Moore and Newman. Herschels life parallels Moses. He was sent down the river to be found by the pharaohs family at the same time Moses was. Herschels birth father, the late James Coco, becomes Herschels slave after Herschel is rescued by idol makers and works as a sculptor. Eventually Herschel comes to work for the pharaoh as an astronomer, is banished, and ends up tending Moses flock of sheep. Herschel and Moses are brothers in law, marrying sisters, and Herschel thinks God has chosen him to free his people in Egypt. Of course, Moses was receiving the Divine Word, but Herschel misunderstood. I will pause here to laugh hysterically...pause...anyway, the rest of the film is a series of badly written scenes involving Moore and actors who are making special appearances. These scenes do not propel the plot forward, they bring what little story there is to a grinding halt.Jack Gilford plays a tailor. Dom DeLuise has maybe three lines when he meets Herschel in the desert. John Houseman is an archangel, just giving the same line readings he gave in The Paper Chase. David L. Lander is a fake blind man healed by Herschel. Andrea Martin is one of Zereldas sisters. I was not sure who Madeline Kahn was supposed to be, she gives a ride to Herschel, and has about a minute and a half of screen time. John Ritter plays a very unfunny devil. Richard Pryor has one scene as the pharaoh, but it was obviously shot at a different time than Moores scene because the two do not appear onscreen together! In the end, Zerelda turns into a pillar of salt after looking back on New Sodoms destruction, ha ha. Herschel writes the Ten Commandments, and gives them to Moses, who is basking in all the glory. In the final scenes, the screenwriter decide to try and salvage this shallow film by having Herschel bait God into an argument. God comes off as an all powerful bully who was leading Herschel around for his own amusement, speaking through him only to give him the Ten Commandments. We even have Zerelda quip God works in mysterious ways, thereby excusing everyones very unChristian behavior during the film.This film is not funny. There is nary a laugh to be found anywhere. At least Monty Python made fun of many established religious mainstays in Life of Brian in addition to their questionable take on Jesus life, but here the humor consists of poo poo jokes and characters constantly bumping their heads.

Dudley plays Arthur wandering in the desert, always a few steps behind Moses. It came out right after Life of Bryan, so you can guess where the inspiration for this came from. The few mildly funny bits go on way too long until you just close your eyes and grit your teeth. There is one scene where Arthur and Dom Deluise meet in the desert, both of them dragged out and dessicated, dying of thirst. Then they meet like old acquaintances who did not really know each other very well, promise to do lunch. It could have been funny.But the scene that I remember most clearly is a meeting with pharaoh in which pharaoh is a black street kid done up in full King Tut regalia. He must have read the lines straight because at some point before the release, they overdubbed his scene with the Hollywood equivalent of black street lingo voiced by a Jimmy Walker wannabe Kid Dynowannabe.

It is bad enough if you groan once in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence, but when you find yourself groaning over and over again, you have to conclude that the director also is not the brightest bulb in the movie business, nor are the producers for deciding to bring this story to the screen in the first place. The mostly lowrent actors you can excuse for taking on this assignment, because they most likely showed up to get the money and exposure, not that being a part of this jokeofamovie is going to earn them any awards or recognition. It may end up embarrassing them for having such poor judgment as to get involved in such a loser. I see no point in summarizing the plot or even in giving any examples to prove my case, for, to do so, would be cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this debacle could withstand.

There is of course that one important person on the plane, and the hijacker looking for revenge. The sad thing is, some of the methods to stop the hijackers have already been used in other movies. Are we really becoming so unoriginal so quickly?Although it is IceT who for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts at ACTING while he is not busy putting the c back in front of rap who is glorified on the cover, the movie actually stars the less than amazing Kim Oja as a stewardess who is surprisingly OVERLOOKED by the five hijackers, which naturally comes back to haunt them. As for the rest of the cast, the only person I managed to recognize was Steve Hytner, more commonly known as Kenny Bania from Seinfeld.I cannot forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie, when a hijacker used about a POUND of PLASTIQUE to blow a lock off a door...

Maybe a few details, but nothing too plot related. Not like it would matter with this movie. Air Rage blatantly rips off the midair infiltration premise of Executive Decision. IceT leads a team of four elite commandos who wear baggy black shirts that we can only imagine must conceal invisible body armor as their idiotic tactics similar to what 3rd graders use when playing Star Wars on the playground lead them to absorb a hail of gunfire. What entertained me the most about this flick was the use of lookalike hasbeen actors. You will immediately recognize Cyril OReily as someone who once acted in a movie that you really liked, though it was so long ago that you probably will not be able to place it it was Porkys. Here Cyril plays a decent knockoff of a Bill Paxton character. Most Hilarious is porker Gil Gerard, who is so fat that you will never recognize him as TVs Buck Rogers. Instead of evoking his mildly heroic character past, Gerard gives us a passable performance of the crusty fat tough guy persona, which was clearly imagineered for John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a nice hybrid lookalike performance as a Chuck ConnorsKirk Douglas type. In the 10 years since New Jack City, IceTs acting has deteriorated remarkably. It is not acting so much as regurgitation of lines that he might have actually memorized. One of the items that plays into this movie is a CDROM of classified information. It is being hand carried, and it is apparently and unbelievably not encrypted, despite the securitysavvy aura of Gerards NSA character. What a joke. I am severely doubting that the information purported to be on the CD would ever even all be assembled into a portable format. Despite being in a closed aircraft without silencers, the gunfire is about as loud as canned air, and causes nary a person to flinch, so apparently no foley budget. The assortment of weapons chosen is pretty funny. The flight attendants use of a coffee pot is about the most realistic depiction of violence in the film. When she takes intuitively to the miniUzi pistol, which has got to be one of the worst pistol designs ever, that is just too stupid. A true elite team would carry MP5s for this type thing or maybe SOCOMM .45s, or even customized Hi Powers if they were really old school, or maybe something FN 5.7 if new school... The lameo standard issue 92Fs are totally unbelievable, having lost most of their cool after Lethal Weapon I. The bad guys, supposedly experienced soldier of fortune types, have an assorted mixture of absurdity, like the aforementioned miniUzi pistol and a Tec9 with the infamous nonfunctional barrel extender that is not a silencer. There was one touch of realism on which I would like to correct the other reviewers The flight attendant and IceT did lower the craft to 10,000 feet for breathable air before they opened the door. And I also got the impression that the flight attendant was NOT able to get the door closed, that she basically just gave up on that point. As far as the landing, there was no mention of flaps until about 2 seconds before touchdown. Sigh. Only the Dukes of Hazard eluding Roscoe P. Coltrane at the pass could shame this movie for use of stock footage. They obviously chose the incredible and retired SR71 because they could not get stock of an F117. Aside from the fact that they were mothballed already in 2001, let us also forget for a moment that the SR71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of the B2, and that at point blank range... Well, I am no expert, but I am having doubts as to whether it would be invisible on Radar. As others have pointed out, the repeated references to F15s when they were showing F 16s was laughable. Details of the 747 were pretty stupid. No airline would put that few passengers on a 747 to begin with, not to mention everything else that was idiotic about it. Pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wiring. Wow. What a show. Catch it on Stars or something. Do not pay to rent it, but do watch it for laughs.

Plot notwithstanding, when a movies action revolves around airplanes, you would think the writersproducersdirector or ANYONE! would do a little bit of homework as to at least a FEW of the details. The mistakes were so glaring that I was fuming by the end of the movie. Here are just a few I am glad I missed the SR71 sequence  certain to have been worse than the Air Force One F117 spectacle. Commercial airlines usually have their logos painted on the aircraft rather than BOEING 747 \u0096 likely the cheap use of some Boeing advertisingpublicity footage by the director. Exposed wiring connected by wire nuts is mediocre at best for house wiring, much less multimillion dollar aircraft avionics wiring. Airplanes like the 747 rely on pressure alone rather than ships supply oxygen to maintain breathable air, and if they did rely on an onboard supply, the canister would be far bigger than fist sized. Medical tape is not a suitable substitute for a threaded hose connection. Those were F16s, NOT F15s. Mach 1 speed of sound would be difficult to attain on a static engine run up for takeoff watch the airspeed indicator. Standard formation is simply keeping the formation inside one nautical mile, route formation is what they were flying  not the most useful formation for an intercept. Acquiring missile lock is not likely to get an airline pilots attention  they have no radar detection or countermeasures. Wait for my signal is not interflight communication for preparing to fire anything. Depressurization from a door opening in flight is not grounds for an immediate steep left bank. Yelling into a headset does not make it transmit. Magnetic headings are given as headings not bearings, and headings are between 001 and 360 degrees compasses in the air are just like compasses on the ground!, so turning left not port \u0096 that is a boat thing from a bearing of 618 to 502 is just stupid. It is in most cases impossible to just turn the yoke left until the correct heading is reached \u0096 that sort of thing will result in 360 degree rolls until the yoke is centered again. The likelihood of a flight attendant immediately finding and successfully engaging the autopilot is only slightly greater than the likelihood of her actually landing the jet safely. Airplanes do not stall immediately upon pulling the throttle back, and 747s have more than one little lever to control the multiengine thrust. Flaps are lowered in increments usually just prior to and immediately following landing gear extension, not seconds before landing good way to crash. Wheel brakes are required to stop an airplane, simply pulling the throttles this time a different lever in the movie to idle will just allow you to go off the end of the runway at a slower speed.

One of the most confusing things about this production is the title. For a director who is well known for directing erotic films about lesbian vampires; you would expect a film with the word nude in the title to be a particularly barebreasted one; but in fact, there is not a lot of nudity here at all. Instead of erotic lesbian vampires with no clothes on; we have got a cumbersome plot about a man who wants to unlock the secret to immortality, a young woman whose affliction might hold the key and a suicide cult, who do not get to do much. The film starts off promisingly with a sequence that sees a young girl carried off by a mysterious bunch of people in masks under the watchful eye of a young French man, who also happens to be the son of a man of importance. Through his investigation, he soon discovers that this woman is not just a normal lady, and as he delves deeper into the cult; he discovers that cannot be killed by bullets, drinks blood and cannot go out in daylight...sounds like a clear cut case of vampirism to me.Jean Rollin keeps the fantasy atmosphere going throughout the film, but it fails to be interesting because the plot is so badly executed. It is possible to keep up with what is going on, but only because there is so many other films that follow similar plots to this one. The director seems to know that he is messed up the plotting too, as the climax is basically an excuse to explain the film to the audience. There is a twist thrown in at the end also; but the film would have been better without it. I guess this was Jean Rollins attempt to be a little original, but it comes off as a hamfisted attempt at such, rather than a logical continuation of the story. The cinematography is fairly neat, with lots of the plot taking place in suitably Gothic locations. The girls on board complete what is a pretty picture, and what Rollins film lacks in logic and consistency, it somewhat makes up for in style.

Of course, he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to Earth for Wirth so he can use Wirths DNA to make the people of Earth his slaves. Huh? His laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture Wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie. Not only are they boring, but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most.The ideas might be nice on paper, but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity, particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien. But the effects are the bane of the movie. The opening scene involves Chong on her spaceship, communicating with her superior, someone who we do not see but that Chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light. They use no spoken words, but telepathy, so we are treated to subtitles. Trouble is, both Chong and her superiors subtitles both look alike, and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually speaking at any given moment, which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish. The spaceship is the worst effect to come out of Hollywood this side of an Ed Wood film. Now, I am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this, but these effects really got to me. The most offensive was the most simple one a fake night sky. The stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone. Most notably are the moments where Chong tells someone she comes from Pleiades, and we get a shot of the seven stars. Thing is, the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie, but any stargazer knows that Pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations Perseus and Taurus, and the cluster does not take up much room in the sky at all. These effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment. Be careful, for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have Willie Nelson turn into a human spotlight and . . . Oh, it has to be seen to be believed!Starlight, star bright; Last star I see tonight; I wish I might, I wish I may; not have to watch any more of this trash today.Zantaras score 1 out of 10.","label":0},{"index":8966,"txt":"This foolish, implausible tale is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a hardboiled police detective delivers some nearlyaudible lines confirming our greatest fears He is dead. Perhaps the film would have been saved had the director forgone the dazzling star power of A. Martinez in favor of this sadlyanonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment. That a noname hacktor off the street could salvage such a dishwater film is no less likely than a villain committing murder by dropping stones into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver.

Just a bunch of footage of thirdworlders with baskets on their heads as another reviewer said. Walking along endlessly as if that had some deep meaning.

Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor, and  artistically  it fails miserably. It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi, hurriedly threw it together, placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music, which is incessantly repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes, Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slowmotion if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode, you will see what I mean. What disappointed me the most, however, was Philip Glasss soundtrack. I could not  and still cannot  believe that these commercialsounding New Age type drones, which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14yearold on a Casio calculator, were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectlysynchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi.

The Philip Glass score for this one had neither the beauty nor the correlating strength of the first. Compared with Koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and pointless.

Part of the problem is the casting Chris Klien as a former action hero. he is not bad, but he is really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy. As I said he is not bad, he is just just miscast for what his back story is. The real problem here is the combination of the script, which really is not funny and seems artificial at times, and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness. There is no life in the way things are set up. Its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list. It makes for an unengaging film. And yet the film occasionally springs to life, such as the in the final show down that ends the film. That sequence works, but because the earlier parts of the film floundered its drained of much of its power.I cannot really recommend the film.

I saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky. Considering some indicate that the original version was LONGER and without crappy dubbing, my review must be read with this in mind.Although I know that Rene Clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and Louise Brooks has a bit of a cult following as well, this is in many ways a technically poorly made film. While Hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929, up through the early to almost the mid30s, a lot of famous French films were essentially silent filmswith some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film. The lip movements in many, and in particular this film, do not even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an American like Ms. Brooks could do a French film. This is just sloppy and I would have preferred they had just made a silent filmand as a silent film this is would have been an average filmwith excellent camera work at times and some decent silentstyle acting.The problem I also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot. For a silent morality play circa 1920, it would have been fine, but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary that means oldnot slutty. A lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fianc\u00e9 cannot handle it. She gives it all up, temporarily, but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end! A tad melodramatic, huh? And also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped.Finally, the character of the fianc\u00e9s friend? I found very disturbing and unreal. He looked like Harold Lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else. As he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about, his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received meanspirited. Were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused? This seems to me that is what is implied and I do not like it at all.There are FAR better French films of the era Le Million, La Femme du Boulanger, Fanny, Regain, and others as well as better silent films.

I entered this adventure to find some lost gems and uncomprehended masterpieces, but I did not see anything of the sort in this pastelcoloured mess. I have not really watched many bad films before, but I have got the feeling this is what is called so bad that is good, probably because it is so unintentionally damn funny! First of all, there are the inaccuracies. There are plotrelated inaccuracies, physical inaccuracies, and also psychological inaccuracies. The latter in particular are as insane as Van Dammes ass cheeks inside that blue spandex. Extremely tacky lines exist too and I will not even start to talk about some of the hilarious action moves. There is not exactly bad acting from everyone involved in that hot mess of a movie, except in one particular case. Geoffrey Lewis looks completely pathetic as Frank, which is an utterly stupid character. And, to tell the truth, I was actually very surprised to see that Van Damme did a decent job playing the twins.

I would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie is excellent. The actions scenes with the family ward trying to save the twins is a great start and is good lead in to the main story. However, the film is all down hill from there. It would have been nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise. That is the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills. One brother is supposed to be skilled in Martial Arts, but the other brother is supposed to be skilled in firearms. How convenient when the time arises that the brother who has never picked up a gun before all of the sudden is a great marksman, and the brother who has not been taught any martial arts is all of the sudden doing the splits and high kicks.The plot, action, etc. are just plain ridiculous. My favorite scenes? How about when Van Damne is confronting an armed soldier with an AK47. The soldier is about 100 yards away. Instead of aiming and shooting at Van Damne he is doing a war cry like he is wielding a battle axe and running at him. Van Damne proceeds to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him,...while he is still about 75 to 80 yards away. This movie has one of the most disappointing endings. Bolo Yeung is a skilled martial artist. However, instead of choreographing a decent fight. Bolo is throwing barrels at Van Damne like Donkey Kong.
