I was 13 years old and at that time I found it adequate and somewhat fun. I then came to discover the WORLD of Doc Savage through the Bantam novels of the old pulp magazine stories. I had no idea before any of this of the realm of Doc, but I fast became one of the most avid Doc Savage fans you could ever meet. I read and still own all of the Bantam books, I started going to comic book cons along with Star Trek and Doctor Who and all manner of geeky fat kid events and had a wonderful time with each adventure I took with Doc and the ORIGINAL Fab 5. Philip Jose Farmers Book  The Apocalyptic Life of Doc Savage became a bit of a bible for me and to this day I have very fond feelings regarding my Doc phase. In so saying I have to admit now years later that this film really missed the boat. It is a film that did not know what it wanted to be when it grew up. The screenplay was infantile and bore little resemblance to the pulp story. These stories from the 30s were short and if one looked at Lester Dents AKA Kenneth Robeson outline for writing them, they broke down into PERFECT 3 act dramas that screamed for screen treatment. One would have thought that with George Pal and Michael Anderson at the helm, it would have turned out better. The spoof elements miss the target and the more serious moments almost get there, but then fall short. It is interesting to watch though in that they hired secondstring character actors guys that had really been only bit players and extras before this film who all acquit themselves very well. Paul Gleason of course has gone on to be a fine utility player in all facets of entertainment and Bill Lucking is a television perennial. All the rest have fallen off the map sadly. I do wish to own a copy of this film as it is the only movie version of my hero, but I fear I will not watch it much as it is too painful. I would say 0 but I give it 2 out of 10 instead for some of the period art direction Docs answering machine at the end was a nice touch and the cast of 3rd stingers getting a moment in the sun.","label":0},{"index":5006,"txt":"I dug this out and watched it tonight. I honestly think it must be 20 years since the last time I saw it. I remember it being a seriously flawed film. I do not remember it being THIS bad!!!!!I am absolutely aghast that a project with this much potential should have been mistreated so reprehensibly. Who am I to blame for this? The 2 guys who wrote and I use that word loosely the script? The casting directors who so terribly miscast at least 3 major characters in the story? Only 2 of them are among the amazing 5. The director, who clearly refused to take it seriously, and kept shoving awful music on top of bad writing  bad acting everywhere? I LIKED the theme song but it should never have been used all the way throughout the entire film! Don Black, who should be ASHAMED at some of the lyrics he wrote for that music?It figures that I should pull this out, less than a week after rereading the comicbook adaptation. The first 1520 minutes of the film moreorless really, LESS parallel the first issue of the comic. As I watched it tonight, I kept wondering why was ALMOST every single detail changed? Doc showing up, then using his wristwatch remotecontrol to open the safe, and the snipers bullet missing him by 5 inches because the refractive glass, were just about the only things left the same. I mean, if you are gonna do an adaptation, WHY in Gods name change EVERYTHING???Once they leave Docs HQ, virtually NOTHING is as it was in the comic which, given Roy Thomas, I figure probably follows the book. I read somewhere they actually combined elements of 2 different novels into one movie. Again WHY? I have heard it was changed because they were not able to secure the kind of budget they wanted. I look at the film, and think... LACK OF MONEY in NO WAY explains what I saw on the screen!!You know, when people complain about Joel Schumacher, they should really take a look at this thing. The best thing I can say is, I think it would make a great doublefeature with the 1966 BATMAN feature and probably a great triplebill with that and the 1980 FLASH GORDON. All 3 films are silly. Maybe we can blame the 1966 film and TV series for this. Some fans have complained over the years that Adam Wests BATMAN ruined the image of comicbooks in the minds of generations of noncomics fans. I think the same could be said for Hollywood. I am reminded of how many really, really BAD films based on classic characters have been made over the years, especially it seems to me in the late 70s  early 80s. Charlie Chan, Fu Manchu, Tarzan, Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, The Lone Ranger all murdered by Hollywood types who think, OH, comicbooks! So you know it is supposed to be STUPID! More like they are the stupid ones. What a waste of potential.Let me say some good things... Despite the script and the directing, Ron Ely is GREAT. When I read a DOC SAVAGE story, I do not think of the James Bama paintings, I think of Ely. Bill Lucking who later was a regular on THE ATEAM is terrific. Eldon Quick who I have seen somewhere else, but cannot recall where is terrific. Paul Gleason who I absolutely HATED with a passion and a vengeance in THE BREAKFAST CLUB teachers like the one he played should be banned from ever teaching anywhere, may be the best of the amazing 5 in the film. Pamela Hensley though her part was almost unrecognizable from the original story is terrific. Before she let her hair down, I also realized she looked a HELL of a lot like Ardala Valmar from those awful John Calkins BUCK ROGERS strips I just read the other day. She is got a big nose like Ardala only not quite as pronounced. The comics Ardala actually looked more like the 1936 movie Princess Aura or Cher. Or maybe Streisand. Take yer pick. Ardala actually got plastic surgery in the George Tuska strips after, she was stunning!Paul Wexler, funny enough, I saw just last week in a GET SMART episode. I wonder if he was anything like the character he was supposed to be playing? I do not know, because that character sure was not in the movie the film takes its title from.","label":0},{"index":5007,"txt":"After having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was Is this supposed to be irony or not?

It never played in theaters where I lived and was never shown on TV. Now that I have finally seen the film I can understand why. The plot and characters are never treated seriously... it is all kind of tongueincheek and campy... kind of like the old Batman TV series... only without the benefit of being funny... or having any visual flair. Corny dialogue, cheesy special effects, dumb stereotypes, crummy action scenes and bad, bad acting.

Unfortunately what it got in 1975 was Doc Savage, The Man of Bronze. Perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer George Pals final film is that his often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of Kenneth Robesons pulppaperback novels probably had George Lucas and Phil Kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other We can do better than that, and adding a bullwhip, a battered Fedora and some much needed character flaws to the mix.A big part of the problem is that Doc Savage is in many ways even harder to write for than Superman \u0096 explorer, adventurer, philanthropist, a scientific and intellectual genius in the bronzed bleachblonde bulletproof musclebound body of a Greek God or rather the form of TVs Tarzan, Ron Ely, a rather dull Charlton Heston clone here, there is simply nothing he cannot do and, more damagingly, nothing that can harm him. The man is the virtual incarnation of Hitlers Aryan ubermensch no surprise that the DVD is only available in Germany!, albeit with allAmerican values. And just in case there should ever be anything he is overlooked not that there ever is he has not one but five sidekicks in his entourage, the less than Fabulous Five. A chemist, an electrician and even an archaeologist I can accept, and at a stretch I could possibly even go as far as to see the possible need for a construction engineer, but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer with him on his adventures? In reality Docs brain trust were probably added because with the hero so tiresomely invulnerable and practically perfect in every way \u0096 even Kryptonite would not put a dent in him  there needed to be someone at risk in the stories, though with the exception of Paul Gleason they are all so horribly badly cast and overplayed as are most parts in the film you would happily kill them all off during the opening titles. The villains fare no better, with Paul Wexler exuding all the menace of a geography teacher as Captain Seas, Scott Walker no, a different one delivering one of cinemas worst accents is it meant to be Scottish, Irish, Welsh, Greek, Pakistani or some nationality noone has ever heard of? while Robyn Hiltons Marilyn Monroeish dumb blonde moll gives Paris no relation a run for her money in the untalented bimbo stakes.Even with those drawbacks, this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients \u0096 lost tribes, a pool of gold, a dogfight with a biplane and a deadly poison that comes alive, all wrapped up in a quest to discover why Docs father was murdered. Unfortunately it is a question of tone in the 60s and 70s pulp superheroes were not brooding figures prone to stateoftheart action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of lowbudget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought, the films aimed purely at the matin\u00e9e market you know, for kids. There have long been rumours that the original cut was more straightfaced \u0096 and certainly much of the camp value has been added in postproduction, be it the Colgate twinkle in Docs eye, the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dustup with Captain Seas or Don Blacks gungho lyrics to John Philip Sousas patriotic marches \u0096 but plenty was in the film to begin with. After all, it is hard to see how one of the villains underlings making phone calls from a giant rocking crib was ever intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat, while Docs explanation to Pamela Hensley of why he never dates girls could be a scene written for Adam Wests Batman. Instead, the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional, such as Doc displaying his sixth sense by, er, bobbing his Adams apple.Perhaps an even bigger problem is that, while promising on paper, the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion, be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of New York skyscrapers or escaping from a yacht full of bad guys. Even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes swirling through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director Michael Anderson having demonstrated their own invulnerability a couple of scenes earlier, Doc manages to dispatch them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the curtains on them.Still, aside from Docs various vehicles all stamped with his logo and looking more moulded plastic than bronze, the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously L.A. standing in for New York while Fred Koenekamps cinematography ensures the film often looks good despite the low budget. And it is good to see a superhero movie that does not spend most of its running time on an origin story, though one is left with the suspicion that Doc sprang fully formed from the loins of Zeus himself.It is a film I would really like to like more, but it just feels like 100 minutes of lost opportunities. No wonder Doc Savage, The Arch Enemy of Evil, the sequel so optimistically promised in the end credits, never happened.","label":0},{"index":5013,"txt":"I was fortunate enough to meet George Pal and still have my DSTMOB poster autographed by him at a convention shortly after the release, and asked him why he chose to do the film camp. Before he could answer, two studio flacks intercepted and lectured me on how the studio knew best and how no one will take such a film seriously. I had been reading the Bantam reprints for a couple of years thanks to a friend ComiCon attendees of the 1970s will recall Blackhawk and his band? I was in a couple of years of that with him, and had higher hopes than what we got.The flacks insisted that no high adventure would ever be done seriously, and so doing camp was the only way. Several other fans jumped in on my side, with Pal listening as best he could. At the end of the little event, Pal came up to us and apologized, wishing he could have done more and better.STAR WARS put the lie to the flacks, and a year after Pals death, Spielberg and Lucas proved that Doc Savage could have easily been the next major movie franchise...if it had not been for the flacks.Tear out the memory or history of Doc, and the film would have been worth a 610 rating as nothing more than a mindless popcorn seller.But destroying the legacy like that was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the crib.Doc Savage can still come to the screen, and survive the inevitable comparisons by the illinformed to Indiana Jones, but it would have to be done in all seriousness and earnest to reclaim the glory that we should expect from the First American Superhero.SIDENOTES Yes, there was a second script for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL, and it is a lot more serious.

Unfortunately, this description of the movie sounds a great deal more entertaining than the movie itself.Originally written for the theatre by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, NORMAN... IS THAT YOU? was an absolute disaster on the New York stage. To give the play its due, I actually saw it staged in the 1970s as a community theatre productionand while no one would accuse it of being anything other than a shallow farce, the cast played so broadly and in such dropdead manner that it proved quite amusing. It is a pity the cast of this film did not do the same.This is an atrociously performed motion picture. Red Foxx, one of the most hilarious comics of the 20th century, is about as funny here as yesterdays wash, Michael Warren who later appeared on the television series HILL STREET BLUES to much better effect competes with Foxx to see who can give the worst performance, and Pearl Bailey is not far behind; truth be told, only Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson, and a cameo by Wayland Flowers have any sparkand sadly, that is only in comparison with the rest of the cast.Not only is the film badly performed, it looks bad.

Part of this movies problem is its lead actor Melvyn Douglas. He was a lousy actor and lazy with it. For most of his career, he allowed his good looks, a glib manner and usually, but not in this movie some fine scriptwriting to make up for his lack of acting ability. I disliked Douglas as an actor before I knew anything about him as a person; I have learnt enough about him to know that I also despise his politics. I will give Melvyn Douglas credit for one thing his chromosomes did produce the incredibly talented and sexy actress Illeana Douglas.Melvyn Douglas made this movie right after the brilliant Ninotchka ... talk about a comedown! The Amazing Mr Williams is allegedly a comedy, but I never laughed. Douglas plays a plainclothes detective on the homicide squad, named Kenny Williams. I never heard of a police detective named Kenny, but if they called him Kenneth Williams ... well, what a carryon. The whole city is in a panic because a serial killer is going about, killing women. No motive is given for this; he just likes to kill women. The mayor Jonathan Hale, better than usual calls Williams on the carpet to account for his failure to catch the killer.SPOILERS APPROACHING. The cheap, vulgar, untalented and unattractive Joan Blondell plays the mayors secretary. She does not sound literate enough to file a letter, much less type one. Blondell and Douglas squabble like a cat and a dog, so it is blatantly obvious they are going to end up together.At this movies lowest point, Melvyn Douglas decides to draw out the killer by dressing up as a woman. You do NOT want to see Melvyn Douglas in drag! He is well over six foot, and he does not even shave off that annoying moustache. The similarlytashed William Powell was an actor very similar in type to Melvyn Douglas but much more talented. When Powell disguised himself as a woman in Love Crazy, he had the integrity to shave off his moustache a genuine sacrifice, as Powell needed it to grow in again for his next role. But Melvyn Douglas brings nothing whatever to his role in this movie, not even a razor. He plays his drag scenes with the same annoying smirk he used throughout the bulk of his career.On the plus side, The Amazing Mr Williams has several of those splendid supporting players who made Hollywoods movies of the 30s so delightful. Edward Brophy is brilliant here, touching and funny as a criminal who gets an unlikely furlough from his life sentence. The dyspeptic Donald MacBride is fine as a cop who gets mistaken for the killer, and is nearly lynched by a mob. Ruth Donnelly is splendid as usual for her, but here she gets a chance to show her talents away from her usual orbit on the Warner Brothers backlot. Jimmy Conlin, Luis Alberni and the grinning Dave Willock are all fine in small roles. Barbara Pepper whom I usually dislike is good here too. The grossly unpleasant Maude Eburne gets some screen time; I always loathe her, and she gives the same performance in every film ... but some audiences enjoy Eburnes onenote performance very much, for reasons I cannot fathom.If you are familiar with Hollywood character actors of the 1930s, and the roles they tended to play, one glance at IMDbs cast list will tell you who the murderer is. That is the problem with The Amazing Mr Wiliams everything is too obvious.

Australians are different than us most of the rest of the world, so we most of us automatically come at it with an air of oddness about them. The couple involved is religious different than most of culture and Adventists different at that. So their lifestyle and mindset are suspect to begin with. Dingos are different animals than other dogs, so again we are faced with oddness questions. The real story, then, is how society and the world treats the different, those who have different accents, different beliefs, than we do and how we treat what they say as suspect.It is difficult to hear the phrase A dingo took my baby! without laughing and there are humorous posts, sadly, all over the web about it. But in the years that followed the story and the movie it has been discovered as you will find in web searches that much larger children have been stalked by dingos. Research by experts in dingos have shown that it was not only possible but most probable that the baby was taken by dingos maybe a pair, extracted expertly from the clothing and eaten within moments without a trace.Yet what is left behind is the question of why people defended dingos when they were found to be endangering children rather than killing the dingo to save the children, why because a womans affect expression is so cold she is assumed to be guilty, and on and on.Haunting questions, with or without the film.","label":0},{"index":5021,"txt":"This early Adam Sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989.

Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny manner when this film was made, much like his character. The majority of the films jokes come from Sandler having conversations with himself, usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he is too ugly and cannot get women. The film is hard to watch too because it does not treat itself like a real film. Sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film, often referring to the films low budget or questionable content. The film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch.

This movie portrays unimaginable characters doing things that never would have happened in the series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest, and lawabiding. In this movie, he is a criminal who is making moonshine and smoking weed with the governor of Georgia.

AND HOW IS BOSS HOGG ALIVE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE REUNION MOVIE IN 1997! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? IT SEEMS MAGICAL THAT THESE CHARACTERS CAME BACK TO LIFE, WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR 11 AND 8 YEARS? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they should have brought back James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones, and Catherine Bach like they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family friendly movie with the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is compared to this disgusting, disgraced movie! If you want to see good Dukes movies, either buy the original series, or go out to walmart.com and buy the DVD set of 2 that includes the Reunion, and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies!

I bought this movie for 7.99, assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man Sandler is in it and because I assumed some women would get naked judging by the Rrating and scantilyclad women on the cover. Well, there are quite a few scantilyclad women, but none get naked. I am not sure what point this was in Sandlers career, but I am guessing it was even before his SNL days. I can be wrong. This is like watching one of his home movies. He might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol times...but we the audience are left to dry. This is hardly a movie! Sandler does a lot of talking to the camera, and even admits at one point that this is nobudget movie that is right, not a lowbudget movie, a NObudget movie. So our job is pretty much to laugh AT the quirky characters. There is no steady plot, it is like an extended sketch comedy showbut a crude and badly written one. That guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience. And Sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic Henny Youngman line Take my wife, please and the audience is on the floor? I am not even going to TRY to make any logic here. Sure, Sandlers current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense the penguin in Billy Madison, the midget in Happy Gilmores Happy Place but the comedy works. This is a strictly amateurish work, and even if you are curious about Adams early days in filmyou still will not be interested. You are better off checking out his start on SNL or maybe his underrated role in Mixed Nuts. Of course, the Sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle. Billy Bob Thornton also makes a short appearance, Billy Zane Titanic has a supporting role and the great Burt Young from the Rocky movies has a significant role.

He shrugs and moves on, since neither the Knoxville or Scott know what he is talking about nor do we. It was like the engine died and was restarted.The few times the General Lee flew through the air were not even that exciting. Nothing I have not seen on the TV Series.Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo is upset at Luke for stealing the girl he liked. The only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it although roughly. The rest of the time it seems distant and forced.Seann William Scotts awful, horrendous accent or lack thereof.I hated Willie Nelsons performance. Were bad jokes supposed to be endearing?

Why they would take a wonderful television show, which I loved, have never missed an episode, and own seasons 14 on DVD, and ruin it, I will never know. The television show was a family show, and although Daisy has the body, it was really flaunted, or even addressed in the show, save the outfits. A family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage, and I would not recommend anyone go see it. Another thing I did not like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors along with the rest of the original cast, and they are also extremely cute. The new Bo and Luke are not even a little cute. That was one of the drawers for the show. The casting is terrible. They could have at least gotten a brunette for Daisy. I do not think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg, either. Every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role. The only role they cast halfway decent is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but still it is no comparison. Denver Pyle is an actor all his own, and that made him perfect for the role. I think that the casting is awful, the story is awful, and all in all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty, terrible movie. I would not recommend anyone go see it.

Denver Pyles Uncle Jessie was also the moral center of the family, always insisting that the Boys do good, even at their own expense or embarrassment while he made sandwiches and coffee for when the chores were done. They always did the right thing and had a sort of earnest naivet\u00e9 about them that was quite appealing. We wanted to be more like them than we were, sorta. My favorite gimmick from the show was how they always buckled their seat belts before roaring off, which was apparently too moral for this film.By transforming the Duke family into a pack of leering, wisecracking, criminally minded, redneck baiting, misogynistic losers the movie has no moral standpoint, where the show was all about how honest or incorruptible the Dukes were  Are the Duke boys in this movie supposed to come off as good guys? I wanted to punch them both in the nose. They seem to have a lot of free time on their hands that could be spent doing chores back at the farm and end up pursuing less than noble ends, if not acting like a pair of 14 year old boys who have not grown up. There should be no marijuana use, no gawking at buxom, nubile coeds  their breasts, no shenanigans involving the Brothers in da Hood. All of it looks like the work of a marketing consultant who took a poll at the mall of what 14 year old boys like to see in movies. The problem being that 14 year old boys cannot possibly remember the show, IMHO should not be seeing this movie either, and the parents who might feel nostalgia for the show will be disgusted by what the writers, director  producers did to our collective memories just to part us from our money, which is exactly how I feel. What were they thinking???And boy did they EVER get Daisy wrong. Jessica Simpson all dolled up like a Pamela Anderson mall slut may be the only reason for anyone to see this disgrace, but you can service your needs just fine downloading some promotional stills of her, printing them up  pinning them to the wall in a restroom. She is hardly in the film at all which is the movies only saving grace, and the ten minutes or so they used her was STILL excessive. Catherine Bachs Daisy may have had the same kind of shorts, and long legs that make people feel funny just looking at her, but the Daisy she played was a PERSON. The pratfalls she elicited by simply being who she was had an almost natural ring to it. She remains one of the most outrageously sexy pop culture icons ever created but there was somebody at home. And most importantly she was a sweet, caring person who could not help it if the guys went Ga Ga over her.By contrast, Jessica Simpson appears phony, contrived, made up, costumed, posed, aloof, bored, out of place, and I do not think she even looks that great in the outfit. She does not look like a person but a plot device, conjured up during a deal with someone representing her agent. Ms. Simpson would be well advised to fire that person immediately and pretend like the whole thing never even happened. Whatever the joke was, she is not in on it and is disgracefully exploited for TA. If that is all she wants from her career, executive produce the sequel if only to ensure yourself enough screen time at least, because this effort was just pathetic.The bottom line is SKIP IT. For the cost of two tickets and a Slurpee to go you can pick up one of Warner Bros. excellent box set collections of the original shows on DVD and the entire family can watch them together. That was why it worked. The only real purpose I can see in the film might be it is future use as an interrogation tool at Guantanamo Bay.

I like stupid comedies but this one did not offer many laughs. It was a pretty dull picture with the first hour being really hard to sit through. The second part was a little better but this film was still a missed opportunity. The film focused on Bo and Luke way too much. The characters in general were not very interesting and the actors portraying them did not do a very good job.The acting was not very good. I was not expecting it to be good in the first place but none of the leads were very funny. Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville both give below average performances. The latter was pretty good as Stifler but he tries way too hard here. The latter just seems to be looking for a paycheck and nothing else. Jessica Simpson is not known for her acting nor is she really known for her singing. She is famous for having her own reality show and for saying really dumb things. She is pretty but she is a weak actor. It does not matter though because she does not really appear in the movie and the character she plays is not complex or anything. Willie Nelson also has a minor role and he does not do anything special.The screenplay was written by John OBrien and he made two films prior to the Dukes of Hazzard. The first one was Cradle to the Grave, which was okay. The second one was Starsky and Hutch which was pretty funny. He does not do a good job here though as the story is a mess. He also forgot to add jokes and a few other things that would have made this film work better. The movie is also pretty long for a comedy. Okay, 106 minutes is not exactly long but it feels so much longer because there is very little humor in the first hour. I think comedies should be kept short or else they have to find a lot of material to cover the entire running time. The Dukes of Hazzard barely has enough funny gags to keep it going for thirty minutes let alone 106 minutes. The car sequences were average and they do not save an already troubled film.

Hollywood cannot come up with anything original so they take something that was good and ruin it for some . I only hope that this movie makes 10xs less than it cost to make. The only ones to have any fun with this crap are the guys who got to drive the General Lee. The audience is the victim.Do not see it, watch the reruns of the TV show instead. They still hold up 20 years later.","label":0},{"index":5052,"txt":"When I heard that the Dukes of Hazzard was going to be remade with current actors and a solid script, I was like, alright, I will give it a chance, it is not going to be better than the first, but we will see what happens. Well, I saw what happened. I saw a great late 70s80s show that was a classic, basically humiliated by Hollywood. It is so sad to see that Hollywood scriptwriters cannot come up with something original these days. They are seeming to take a great show that had a great target audience, and try to REMAKE the classic show. HEADS UP Hollywood... IT As not WORKIN!!!! Anyway, more about the show. I think they could have casted a better actor than Sean William Scott Stiffler from American Pie to play Bo. I am sure that John Schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and taken advantage of. Also, Get for real, Johnny Knoxville, as Luke Duke. How low can you go?? A crappy jackass actor to play lovable Luke. This sickens me. Also, I will give Jessica Simpson is a beautiful woman, but her acting sucks. Catherine Bach who played the original Daisy, was smart, sexy, strong, opinionated and a good IL southern girl. She was every little girls role model growing up! I owned the doll and the Jeep  thank you very much!!! Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a smart ass, 2bit slut as Daisy Duke. Daisy never was blonde. Why did they have to cast her. Jessica Alba would have played a great Daisy Duke. She can speak with a great southern accent, and she is gorgeous, and would have done a wonderful job. Anyway, I would like to say that this movie blew something fierce. I feel like I got ripped off by paying 8.50 for tickets, and they should refund my money. If you like the Dukes of Hazzard the original series do not see this movie. It will just upset you. CMT country music television plays the reruns of the Dukes all the time later at night.

Naturally, being a fan of the TMNT back in the day, this obviously peaked my interest. So when I started watching the show... to say I was disappointed by the end result is an understatement. Some time later more like recently, I got a chance to revisit the series.First off, let us talk about some of the positives. They managed to recreate the Turtles lair as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this. There tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and whatnot. And the Turtle suits, while not the greatest piece of puppetry and whatnot, were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series.People tend to complain about getting rid of Shredder quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a Power Rangers show. But you can only have Shredder get beat so many times before it gets boring and undermines his worth as a villain... and besides, most fans do not realize or do not remember or just plain ignore the fact that in the original comic, the Shredder was offed in the very first issue! Never mind the countless resurrections that would follow. So on a personal standpoint, I was sort of glad they got rid of Shredder because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode. I find that Shredder in small quantities work best because then his encounters with the Turtles are all the more memorable.Unfortunately, they end up replacing him with these original villains who, as stated, seemed more fit for a Power Rangers show than a Ninja Turtles show. And with these new magicwielding generics comes a new female magicwielding turtle, the infamous Venus De Milo. I will be honest; I never got comfortable with her. I am not against the idea of a female turtle; I am just against the idea of one who uses magic and thus sticks out like a sore sight among a clan of ninja turtles who seem somewhat out of their domain. I almost get the impression that this could have easily been the Venus De Milo show dealing with her makebelieve enemies and the TMNT are just there to provide the star power or whatever was left considering the timeframe this was released. Fortunately, they all share the spotlight together.Next Mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it. Given time and maybe another season, I really believe this live iteration of the TMNT could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness. But while the idea was sound, the execution was flawed although there are a couple good episodes in this series. As it stands, Next Mutation is one of those oddities in Turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten.","label":0},{"index":5056,"txt":"Quite typical for swedish movies of this type.

Two police officers start investigating the case that soon becomes more complicated than it would appear at first.As usual in Swedish film the cast is mostly made up of the same people you have seen over and over again. Mikael Persbrandt must be in every Swedish film from the last few years! But that is OK i guess since Persbrandt is one of few that performs solidly here like he usually does. The problems with this film mostly revolves around the story itself. First of all the robberies feel mostly like background. Rather this is more a movie about a young policewoman fighting to prove herself in a male world like that has not been made a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of Sofia Helin. Also there is a completely unbelievable plot twist near the end that seems about as plausible as Aliens landing. But still, i did think it was a quite nice touch considering i was half asleep right about then. It spiced things up a bit and actually saved the rating from dropping another step.In the end the main problem is the same thing as with most other Swedish movies of this kind. Simply that the action and suspense does not live up to the standards we are used to from other movies of this kind mostly Hollywood. It feels cheap and rather weak in comparison.

Naturally if you mix a quaint Cornish village  largely populated by retired genteel ladies  with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of silliness will ensue. However, the last seven minutes of the film descend into the totally ludicrous and is not even redeemed by being particularly funny. It is a real shame, because this comedy has the potential to be every bit as good as 1998s Waking Ned Devine, which also portrayed a picturesque small village and its oddball inhabitants trying to extract themselves from a tricky situation.The protagonist of Saving Grace is middleaged, recently widowed Grace Trevethyn, whose husbands legacy of bad debts has forced her into an unconventional way of earning money. Helped by her gardener, Matthew, she turns her horticultural expertise to the lucrative cultivation of marijuana. Unfortunately, this leads her into confrontation with the local police, her husbands creditors and a French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . whom all turn up at her greenhouse simultaneously. The relationship and rapport between Grace and Matthew is wellportrayed, and Brenda Blethyn gets the viewer emotionally involved with her likeable character  you can really feel what she is going through.The casting of the minor roles is excellent, even if some of them are rather outlandishly eccentric. However, the transformation of Jacques the drug lord into Graces romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the movie at all.

Much of the cast seems to be on autopilot, and they are almost all very clearly too old and in one case too young for their declared ages. Worse, they are all speaking Austinese, that peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that could not be further from the way people actually spoke in Austens day think Yosemite Sam, I kid you not. This is particularly sad, considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally farcial Fakespearan that Olivier and his cronies were so fond of bellowing at the top of their lungs.And worst of all is Gwyneth Paltrow. She is only ever played one character in her films, and she stays true to form here, running through her entire range smirking to sulking in the first ten minutes, then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film. There is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers, nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart.In short, there is very little reason to watch Emma.

Now Sense and Sensibility had this flaw of a slow pace, but at least it had lively lines to make up for it, as well as some good performances!That brings me to flaw 2, which is of course, the acting. While I do not happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film, I am sure they are capable of good work, but I did not see much of it in this movie.

Why did everybody like Emma, for example? Sure, she was nice to the rich, handsome people in front of them, but she was an awful gossip behind their backs. If her friends were ugly, then she did not even bother to go behind their backs. So, why is this girl so great? Why do people have to tell stories, just to make her laugh?

Dr. Eliot Hackenstein David Muir is in the early stages of his rejuvenation of living tissue experiments, Dr. Hackenstein manages to bring a skinned rat back to life which confirms he has succeeded in bringing the dead back to life... It is now Three years later  Dean Slesinger Micheal Ensign is round the Docs house for dinner. As Dean Slesinger  Dr. Hackenstein eat they talk about Hackenstiens experiments which Dean Slesinger has always been opposed to, Dr. Hackenstein shows Dean Slesinger his laboratory in his attic where he keeps the severed head of his wife Sheila Sylvia Lee Baker who died in an unfortunate accident  can telepathically talk to him Christy Botkin provides Sheilas voice apparently. Dr. Hackenstein also show is Dean Slesinger a skinned chicken running around in a cage  explains that with the process he has developed he will bring Sheila back to life. The Dean has some sort of seizure  apparently dies. Meanwhile sisters Wendy Bambi Darro as Dyanne DiRossario  Leslie Trilling Catherine Davis Cox plus their Brother Alex John Alexis  their cousin Melanie Victor Stacey Travis are driving along near Hackensteins house when they crash, they seek shelter  assistance  arrive upon Hackensteins doorstep. Dr. Hackenstein invites the four stranded travellers to stay for the night. Later on Dr. Hackenstein is visited by two graverobbers, Xavier Logan Ramsey  Ruby Rhodes Ann Ramsey who deliver a male body when Hackenstein actually needs female parts for Sheila. Dr. Hackenstein being the genius that he is decides not to waste the opportunity of having three young beautiful specimens available  starts to borrow the bits n pieces he needs to complete Sheila...Written  directed by Richard Clark I was pleasantly surprised by Dr. Hackenstein, I will state right now that it as not brilliant by any stretch of the imagination but for what it was I actually quite liked it. It moves at a reasonable pace even if it does tend to drag a little bit during it is middle as things settle down. The script tries to mix slapstick humour like a scene when Dr. Hackenstein is trying to restrain Melanie  she tries to gain the attention of his deaf housekeeper Yolanda Simpson Catherine Cahn by kicking out  Hackenstein keeping Melanie behind Yolandas back who is seemingly oblivious to what is happening, with a touch of gore but I would say Dr. Hackenstein is more of a comedy than horror in conception  feel throughout. There are some tacky puns  sexual innuendo as well which are always good for a laugh, Dr. Hackenstein to Wendy would you like to see my instruments as an example. I also thought the scene when Mrs Trilling Phyllis Diller reports her missing daughters to the bemused detective Olin William Schreiner was a pretty amusing sequence going round in circles talking about why he is not looking for them even though he has only just been told, why the cell does not have a prisoner in it  that if he did not find the cousin not to worry about it. None of it is flat laughoutloud but I must admit I found myself smiling on occasion  found the film as whole to be quietly amusing. There is not a lot of on screen gore, a few severed limbs, Sheilas decapitated head, some medical stitching  those skinned animals which are definitely fake by the way. I liked the characters in Dr. Hackenstein too, which was surprise in itself. The acting is not brilliant but to give everyone credit they put some effort into it, lots of exaggerated facial movements  some serious overacting means it is never dull, oh  the three birds in Dr. Hackenstein are fit if you know what I mean. Technically the film is OK as well, once again it as not going to win any Oscars but I have to give the filmmakers at least some credit for trying to pull off a turn of the century period setting. It does not always work, the clothes are at odds with each other at times, the girls look like their from Victorian England while the guys look like their from a western. The house looks as if all the filmmakers did was remove any modern object from the room  stick a few candles in there! It comes across as a little bit on the cheap side but it really is not a bad looking film at all considering. Could have done without the comedy music though. Overall I ended up enjoying Dr. Hackenstein much more than I thought I would, although that in itself is not a recommendation. It is certainly is not the best comedy horror film ever made  it certainly is not the worst either. A watchable enough piece of harmless fun.","label":0},{"index":5085,"txt":"Two sisters, their perverted brother, and their cousin have car trouble.

That reason is it sucks! It is a very pointless, dull, imbecilic and totally unmemorable horror comedyparody. Actually, to be honest, I am not even sure if this was meant as a comedy because sometimes the script takes itself quite seriously and tries really hard to be a really ambitious and original late 80s horror effort. In the year 1909, at the dawn of a new era in medical science according to the opening sequences, Dr. Elliot Hackenstein needs exactly three women \u0096 no more, no less \u0096 to refurbish his beloved wife whom he accidentally killed. She is only just a living head left now, but the stupid body snatchers only provide male cadavers. So when Dr. Hackenstein yells out I need three female bodies to bring back my wife, his words are not even cold and there just miraculously appear three young females and one really annoying nerdy kid with car trouble show up at his doorstep. Why does not that ever happen to me? I need a bunch of sexy voluptuous women to fill up my empty harem!!! \u0085 See, nothing! Anyway, the good Doctor sees his wish fulfilled, but unfortunately \u0096 for science that is \u0096 he develops sympathy for one of the three girls. Dr. Hackenstein is a lame film that tries to cash in on the success of ReAnimator and even blatantly steal some of the comical aspects of that classic, like a severed head talking oneliners. It is easy to see why this film is never mentioned anywhere, as it does not appeal to fans of neither the horror nor the comedy genre. The funniest character is undoubtedly the loudspeaking female grave robber Ruby; depicted by the anticherubic Anne Ramsey. 80s horror buffs will certainly remember her from Wes Cravens Deadly Friend, where she played the nasty old hag neighbor who gets decapitated by a basketball. Dr. Hackenstein supposedly takes place in the early 1900s, but there are hardly any attempts to recreate the atmosphere of that era except maybe for some automobiles. Dr. Hackensteins laboratory is a quite clich\u00e9d 80s set piece, with all sorts of smoky cauldrons and test tubes full of fluorescent colors.","label":0},{"index":5087,"txt":"Take your basic Frankenstein flick, inject some Reanimator but not the good parts, and you have Doctor Hackenstein.

To revive his wife, he decides to chop off body parts from some women that have become stranded and, coincidentally, decide to stay the night at his place.I cannot really say the acting is bad, nor is the directing. Everything here is just way too standard. What little attempts there are at humor actually work check out the scene when Hackenstein keeps hiding behind his deaf assistant because she would undoubtedly be very upset if she saw him clutching a woman and a needle, but that is hardly enough to recommend this film. The music is decent, what blood that is there is decent, and the cast looks quite good. And for half of the time, I was even entertained by this film.

Also, the ending goes on forever, making a potentially tense climax seem silly after a while with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. The monster, after it is exposed, is not very scary either unfortunately.

I guess seeing him on screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent. That is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent. Some of the other reviews point out how dumb Detention is, but many neglect to point out the positives. Any movie where at least one annoying teenager gets killed cannot be all bad. Why do so many movies that have a cast of teens always need to include the stereotypical teens? Are not there any other kind of teens? Does every group of teens have one angry black guy? One genius nerd that nobody likes? One slutty girl who is very friendly and in this movie pregnant? One disturbed antisocial white kid from a broken home who everyone agrees is talented but what is the talent?. And one laidback black kid who is in tune with the Universe and so cool that all the other neurotic kids trust him. Then add a couple of generic expendable teens of any color. They do not say much but get shot at some point. Detention would have been better if the bad guys had gotten to blow up the school. Preferably with the writers inside. The dialogue is bad, and the plot is worse. When the bad guys and girl finally hijack a van full of drugs, then they sit inside the van making out. They drive the van to the school because they want to repaint the van at the schools paint shop, but they never get around to repainting the van. By the way, it would have been easier to just put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or a truck and drive away without repainting the Police Van. They also never move the drugs or sell them or do anything else with the big score. For some reason, they decide they have to kill the kids and the teacher Dolph Lundgren even though when the villains take over the school nobody is remotely aware of it because it is after school hours. The handful of people still in the school have nothing to do with painting vehicles, so why go after them? Anyhow, the best part of this movie is that the villains are all armed with numerous machine guns, and they keep finding the teens including a guy in a wheel chair and they keep shooting hundreds of bullets at the teens and usually miss. Towards the end of the movie there is some bloodshed. For every time someone gets shot, there must be at least three hundred bullets fired that miss. The stunts are pretty bad. I read one of the reviews that says that this movie had a budget of 10 Million, and I am amazed.

It hardly seemed that any followup could exceed or even equal the original masterpiece. Unfortunately my worries were wellfounded This movie stinks.I do not know what the people involved in this film were thinking. Jan De Bont, who seemed to have had a fluke when he directed the excellent Speed, does as poorly here or perhaps even worse as he did with the muchhyped duds Twister and Speed 2 Cruise Control. Hey Jan, stick to cinematography, would ya? Liam Neeson is adequate in his role as the doctorpretendingtobeasleeppsychologist  I do not think he is capable of turning in a truly bad performance  but even he cannot save a lame script and weak story. Catherine Zeta Jones proves once again as she did in Entrapment that she lacks the acting ability to rise above the material that is handed to her. The female lead, who did great in an episode of The XFiles, looks lost here as Eleanor, an insomniac hovering on the edge of sanity. And that blond guy, whoever he is, is more wooden than the laughably strange statuettes of children carved into the woodwork around the house. I do not think he changes expression once during the entire film.SPOILERS AHEADThe reason the first movie worked so well is because we were never sure whether the house was truly haunted or whether the manifestations were a result of Eleanors precarious mental state. No spirits are actually seen in the original, leaving much up to the imaginationa hallmark of other great horror films like The Changeling and The Blair Witch Project. In this updated version, we of course get tons of CGI ghosts, which basically in the face of the weak scriptplot make the movie totally unscary. The fx are not even that great, considering they were done by ILM. The frozen breath looks particularly fake. The effects in the underrated Peter Jackson film The Frighteners, which I saw just before this one, were a lot better. The wooden carvings of the children, which are supposed to look creepy, just look silly especially when they scream, and the CGI monsters are nothing to write home about. Rather than providing a relief from the bad acting, bad direction, and bad writing, the effects only add to this mess of a film.Some particularly dumb scenes When the three other characters break into Eleanors bedroom, and none of them seem at all surprised to find a huge scowling demon hovering over the bed. The scene where Eleanor sees the former lady of the house hanging from the rafters... the acting here is particularly bad. And last, but not least, the unintentionally hilarious bit where Wooden Blond Guy utters an uninspired shout of what is supposed to be anguish, leaps up on a piece of furniture, and starts slashing away at the painting of the old, evil guy who built the house. We actually get some satisfaction in this scene, as seconds after his attack, Blond Guy is dragged over to the fireplace by the ghost of the old guy and promptly gets his head cut off by the flue.

After the first few special effects are done with I was waiting for a story to develop.I figured this movie at the least has to be loosely based on the classic novel, so a good story should be there, but it was not. I was relegated to staring at the gorgeous Catherine ZetaJones character throughout the movie basically because there was nothing much else to watch. Lili Talor was such a suck character. I did not like her one bit, something about whiny people. Also, the guy in this film reminded me of the cartoonish Dudley DoRight with his voice and face. I could not relate to the characters at all. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson did an admirable job trying to get through this movie with some type of acting.Half to three quarters of the way I was just dying to go see a campy Friday the 13th or a Scream Queenish film!

The atmosphere is well set out, and the chills are staged well. A haunting masterpiece.The 1963 chiller The Haunting stays closely to the book, but also adds its own details to the plot. Fortunately, these are very few, and so the terror of the book and the chills are executed even better on the screen. The black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie. Excellent! And then, Jan de Bont made this. In 1999, the remake of The Haunting hit the cinemas  if you could call this a remake. Why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself, but for the moment, lets look at the film itself.It starts off averagely, as most horror movies do. The set used for Hill House is beautiful, and oddly mysterious, and for a few minutes, it seems as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair retelling. And then, the first scare comes a loose harpsichord wire slashes a womans face Dr. Marrows assistant. This is hilarious, and truth be told, it nearly had me in tears.From then on, the film just spirals downwards. The acting seems to become somewhat wooden as the film goes on, with Owen Wilsons character being particularly irritating so it is such a relief when he is decapitated by the flue.The special effects practically make this movie,, which is a shame, because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated. Examples of these are many, so I will not bother listing them.So, all in all, I, along with hundreds of others, strongly recommend that you watch the original chiller, or, as an alternative, buy the novel by Shirley Jackson. But please, stay away from this. And, if you do decide to watch this, watch it on the TV as a lot of the channels love to screen this film, and not the original or rent it cheap, but please do not buy it, whatever you do. Do not waste your money!Final rating 410","label":0},{"index":5118,"txt":"How viewers react to this new adaption of Shirley Jacksons book, which was promoted as NOT being a remake of the original 1963 movie true enough, will be based, I suspect, on the following those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one...and those who have never been exposed to either, and who are big fans of Hollywoods current trend towards special effects being the first and last word in how good a film is, are going to love it.Things I did not like about this adaption1. It was NOT a true adaption of the book. From the articles I had read, this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to. And, that seemed reasonable, no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of THE STAND! And not even then But, there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at, in the movie. Reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of THE SHINING. I did not like that, either. What the movies press release SHOULD have said is...We got the basic, very basic, idea from Shirley Jacksons book, we kept the same names of the house and several though not all of the leading characters names, but then we decided to write our own story, and, what the heck, we watched THE CHANGELING and THE SHINING and GHOST first, and decided to throw in a bit of them, too.2. They completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts, to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been born bad. No, instead, this doctor got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their insomnia he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear...like lab rats, who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment...nice guy. This doctor, who did not have the same name, by the way, was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from day.3. In direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies some houses are just born bad, this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened there...and, this time around, Nel gets to unravel the mystery shades of THE CHANGELING. The only problem was, the socalled mystery was so incoherently told that I am sure it remained a mystery to most of the audience...but, then there was no mystery in the first place not in the book, because the house was bad TO BEGIN WITH. It is first victim died before ever setting eyes on it.4. The way the character of Luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous. He was supposed to be a debonair playboy who was someday to inherit the house and was a true skeptic of it is history...and in this one he was just a wineyvoiced, bumbling nerd who could not sleepinsomnia remember and was a compulsive liar.5. I was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word the scene with Nels sisters family, and Mrs. Dudleys little opening speech... to going off into flights of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than THE HAUNTING. It is like it could not make up its mind what it wanted to do.6. I missed Nels narrative through the whole movie. The original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person, through Nels eyes, and we always were privy to her thoughts. That totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version. They also tried to make Nel much more of a heroine. The original Nel was not a bad person, but she was a bitter person could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister? and she liked to moan, and she lost her temper... This one was almost too good to be true. This was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writers had obviously been watching GHOST one too many times.7. They changed the history of the house and it is occupents too much. There was no Abigail Crain the daughter of Hugh whose legend loomed large in the original versions, there was no companion, and there was no nursery. There was also no Grace wife of the original doctor and Hugh Crains wives died in totally different ways. These changes, changed the story WAY too much. I do not know whether the producers of this movie should be glad Shirley Jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they should...BE SORRY if ya get my drift!!! The hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled with!!!.In conclusion, let me just leave you with some words from the original Luke appropriate substitution of the word house for movie! This movie should be burnt to the ground, and the ground sprinkled with salt! My favorite movie of all time remains so. No competition from this one.","label":0},{"index":5119,"txt":"The Haunting.

If at last the door bursts open and a bug ten feet tall lurches through, the reader may be a little scared, but he will also think, Well, I can deal with that. At least it was not a HUNDRED feet tall. There is nothing more frightening than what lurks, unseen and unknown, just on the other side of that tightly closed door, waiting to get you.THE HAUNTING is so completely misconceived that director Jan De Bont more or less starts off his movie by metaphorically throwing open that door himself and yelling Look, everybody, look! It is a tenfoottall bug! Is not that SCARY?! The law of diminishing returns immediately kicks in. By the end of the movie, the director is, so to speak, jumping up and down, banging his CGI pots and pans madly, and hoarsely screaming Look, everyone, look! Here come ten HUNDREDfoottall bugs! ... And now, here come a hundred THOUSANDfoottall bugs! The filmmakers apparently believed that special effects alone could compensate for all the other shortcomings in this endeavor and there are many. They cannot and do not. In fact, impressive as they are, the special effects are so insistent and obtrusive that the distracted viewer winds up staring at them  whether in admiration or annoyance  instead of being immersed in a story.For me, the nadir of this films sheer stupidity comes when a statue, with blood gushing from its mouth, tries to drown Liam Neeson as Dr. Marrow in a fountain. The filmmakers clearly did not know what to do with this alleged idea once they had it, so they just have Neeson thrash around in the water a bit, flailing his arms and going glugglug. By the next scene, the good doctor has apparently dried himself off and, ho hum, forgotten all about the annoying incident.Shirley Jacksons novel seems to have been dumbeddown into this ridiculous screenplay by a committee of lowIQ teenage stoners who thought the way to frighten people was to make every effect bigger and louder Okay, next, let us, uh, make the ceiling, you know, look like a creepy face, and, uh, come down on her ... and all these spiky things, like, trap her in the bed.The sole saving grace of THE HAUNTING is that it at last becomes so awful that it is actually funny. By the time Owen Wilson as Luke Sanderson fell on the floor and then went on his MagicCarpet Ride O Death, I just about fell on the floor myself, laughing.Badly constructed, witless, grotesquely heavyhanded, utterly unbelievable, and filled with clunky dialogue and pointless scenes, this vacuous HAUNTING is a textbook example of how NOT to make a horror movie.","label":0},{"index":5123,"txt":"This movie was one of the greatest movies ever made,,,, it had everything to make a movie great.

Nell tells Theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her. Nell then looks across at Theo, who is several feet away and realises that it was not Theo holding her hand.

It is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened. And can anybody explain what Nells final words mean  It is about family.

Catherine ZetaJones demonstrates once again that, beneath her pretty exterior, there is little depth. In the original, Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion.

Shortly thereafter, two other participants in the study arrive, wild Theo and bad sleeper Luke Sanderson along with Doctor Marrow. Unknown to the participants, Doctor Marrows true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear. Each night, the caretakers chain the gate outside Hill House, preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning, when the caretakers open the lock. There are no working telephones inside Hill House and the nearest town is several miles away. Doctor Marrow revels the story of Hill House.

She learns that Crain built his fortune by exploiting kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them when they were of no more use to him. He then burned the bodies in the houses fireplace to hide any evidence. She also learns that Crain had a second wife named Carolyn, of whom Nell is descended.

The show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a Bway musical and examines their drive  desire to work in this demanding and notalwaysrewarding line of work. Attenborough gives us a freshfaced cast of hopefuls, assuming that they are trying to get their big break in show business, rather than presenting the grittier mix of characters created on stage as a group of working gypsies living show to show, along with a couple of newcomers. The film has one advantage over the play and that is the opening scene, showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to the 1617 on the line depending on how you count Cassie, who is stupidly kept out of the line in the movie.

Not only are songs cut, but unnecessary plot twists added, new dance sequences choreographed, and, let us face it, Richard Attenborough just does not know how to film dancers.Onstage, Michael Bennetts A CHORUS LINE was just that Michael Bennett. His idea, his choreography, his direction, his gift to Broadway and the rest of the world. It was two hours of hardhitting, inyourface realism that really made you feel for these boys and girls. The movie, however, lacks empathy and depth the actors look like they are auditioning for A CHORUS LINE rather than actually auditioning. Every move, every line of dialogue seems so weighted and planned; Michael Douglas, especially, as Zach is too in control for us to believe that he is this extraordinarily bitchy choreographer. Even when he throws his temper tantrums, you never quite believe him because every gesture, every accented word, every nuance is so obviously rehearsed. And as for him not dancing Kevin Kline auditioned for the role of Zach on Broadway. Michael Bennett loved his reading, but Kline could not dance and ultimately lost the part. How I wish they had done the same for Douglas! A CHORUS LINE is supposed to be a show about nobodies, and aside from a few recognizable faces Vicki Frederick, who played Cassie on Broadway, as Sheila and Khandi Alexander, of TVs NewsRadio, as one of the many auditioning dancers you are not supposed to KNOW any of these people. Because you DO know these people. Having a star in any of the roles is a terrible decision when you focus on Michael Douglas and his ranting instead of on the girls and boys on the line and their stories, you lose something.It is truly unfortunate that the best sequence in the show Montage Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love is cut drastically to make way for a terrible new song entitled Surprise, Surprise that surprisingly received a nomination at the Oscars. Cassies mirror dance has a new song and tragically boring choreography  one wonders why they bothered to shoot a movie version at all if they were going to mess with a working formula this much.For fans of musical theatre and those who enjoyed the stage version, this movie is a sad mockery of everything they cherished and loved. For those who never got to see the original production, either on Broadway or on tour, this movie is the only reference they will have to go by. And they will have to wonder just how it got to be the longestrunning musical in Broadway history  until a little show called CATS overtook it in the late 1990s. But THAT is a different story, and do not even get me started there.","label":0},{"index":5140,"txt":"The Broadway musical, A Chorus Line is arguably the best musical in theatre. It is about the experiences of people who live for dance; the joys they experience, and the sacrifices they make. Each dancer is auditioning for parts in a Broadway chorus line, yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite. The film version, though, captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show, and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical, as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance, whatsoever. The biggest mistake was made in giving the directors job to Sir Richard Attenborough, whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for Gandhi. Why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted place?Which brings us to the next problem. A Chorus Line takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes. It is the least flashy of Broadway musicals, and its simplicity was its glory. However, that does not translate well to film, and no one really thought that it would. For that reason, the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers, and should have left the theatre and audition process. The singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet, jazz or tap class. Heck, they could have danced down Broadway in their lively imaginations. Yet, not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film, as Attenboroughs complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical direction.Many scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director Michael Douglas whether he wants to hear them or not. Douglas character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear, and to whom he has no patience. While the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play, some heretical changes were made. The very beautiful Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Lovea smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescencewas removed and replaced with the dreadful, Surprise, a song so bad that it was nominated for an Oscar. Adding insult to injury, Surprise simply retold the same story as Hello, Love but without the wit or pathos.There is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what NOT to do when transferring a Broadway show to film. If you want to see a film version of this show, the next closest thing is Bob Fosses brilliant All That Jazz. While Fosses daughter is in A Chorus Line, HE is the Fosse who should have been involved, as director. He would have known what to do with this material, which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort.","label":0},{"index":5141,"txt":"By the time this film was released I had seen Chorus Line on stage 4 times, and had been anticipating most eagerly the longrumored production of a film of the story.

Perhaps only Josh Logan  Jack Warner could have ruined this in the same way Attenborough did.Onstage A Chorus line was a triumph of workshopping as a production method. Dancers answering a casting call found themselves sitting around shooting the crap about their stagecareer experiences very 70s!. Then Bennett and Hamlisch took some time, handed them a song and cast them as themselves. ...astonishing! Unbelievably modern. The storyof ACL is in turn about answering a casting call for a play we never have a complete view of, because the play does not matter. It was meta before the idea was invented, 25 years before Adaptation noodled with a similar idea. ACL was also another in a reductivist trend that is still alive,  which is a hallmark of modern creativity that technique itself is compelling... that there is more drama in an average persons life than you could ever synthesize with invented characters. What a gracious idea. The stage play had one performance area an empty stage and three different ways to alter the backdrop, to alleviate visual tedium, not to keep viewers distracted. The space recedes and the actors stories are spotlighted. It worked just fine. That was the point. All these ideas are trampled or bastardized. Setwise, there was not one, and no costumes either until the the dancers came out for their final bows, in which the exhilarating One is finally, powerfully, performed in full gold top hats and tails, with moves we recognize because we have watched them in practice sessions. The pentup anxiety of the play is released  and audiences went nuts. After Grampa manhandles this, it is like a mushed, strangled bird. He clearly has the earlier, respected All that Jazz and Fosses stage piece Dancin in mind as he makes his choices. Hamlischs score was edgy  interesting for it is time, but time has not been kind to it. It is as schmaltzy as jazz hands. And that is before Attenborough ever touches it. He is remarkable at finding whatever good was left, and mangling it. A simple question might have helped Attenborough while filming this, Could I bear spending even a few minutes with people like these? A major issue for any adaptation of the play is how the 4th wall of theater pivotal by it is absence in theater would be addressed in the film format. There is never been a more frontal play. The answer they came up with was, I am sorry.. what was the question? The cast has been augmented from a manageable number of unique narratives, to a crowd suffocating each other and the audience, and blending their grating selves together. I was well past my annoyance threshold when that annoying little runt swings across the stage on a rope, clowning at the absent audience. The play made you understand theater people. This movie just makes you want to choke them.Perhaps Broadways annoying trend of characters walking directly to stage center and singing their stories at the audience Les Miz, Miss Saigon instead of relating to other characters started here.

From the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand finale, a joyous curtain call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show, we were totally engaged  captivated by the intensely personal stories, some funny, some clever, some stirring, of this chorus line. The movie is another matter entirely. The focus is now on the director  and WHAT an ogre he is! Every time the film switches to Michael Douglas, there he is with a bitter, sour expression, barking out questions and orders, screaming and yelling whenever he gets the chance. Yikes!! That changes the dynamics of the story. On Broadway, the director was indeed an imperious offstage presence, but he was also sort of a theatrical device to allow the stories of these amazing strongfragileintriguinghilarious chorus line members to be told with insight and clarity. There is a reason this work won the Pulitzer Prize! And actually in one of the only moments the director appears, he is there to comfort the young Puerto Rican Dancer after we hear that dancers heartbreaking story. He appears again to ultimately express his genuine affection concern for Cassie. But in the movie, from the second Douglas director starts bitterly barking orders, the chorus line members stories become secondary. It is like they are in a lousy profession, where a jaded director instead of showing the joy at creating a new exciting theatrical show, is jaded, exhausted, furious at having to audition these chorus members. On stage, there was ALWAYS the excitement of the show. Here in the movie practically from the word go, you feel sorry for everyone involved. During the course of the musical, we desperately wished every single one of those chorus members well, and how happy we would have been if they had all gotten the job! But of course that could not happen. But in the Finale when they all came back in glorious costume with those amazing spinning mirrors on stage, sometimes reflecting us in the audience, in our hearts, and we know, also in the hearts of all those chorus members both accepted and rejected, they were on stage forever dancing in a profession they loved so much, bringing magic to the theatre. In the movie, after all the misplaced story lines and emphasis, that magic becomes totally diluted.

I have seen the show on Broadway 4 times and even auditioned for a touring company of the show once and for someone who pretty much memorized the original production, the 1985 film version is so dreadful on so many levels that I do not even know where to begin. First of all, for those who have never auditioned for a theatrical production, let me assure you that IRL when you audition for a play, the director, producer, and choreographer never ask personal questions and do not give a crap about why you wanted to become a performer. A real theatrical audition, whether it be for a play or a musical, rarely takes more than five minutes. If you are auditioning as a dancer, you get shown a 64bar dance combination once, you do it, and then they decide immediately whether you are in or out. Michael Bennetts original concept of the show was to flesh out the lives of dancers and introduce to the uninitiated the passion for performing and why so many sacrifice so much for so little. The play is about these dancers. First of all, director Richard Attenborough took so much focus off the dancers by beefing up the CassieZach relationship and by casting Michael Douglas as Zach. In the play, you NEVER see Zach...he is just a voice in the back of the theater and his relationship with Cassie is barely touched upon. Cassie shown in the cab in traffic trying to get to the audition and upstairs talking to Larry a character who is not even in the playwas all added for the movie and took so much focus off what the story is about. Major musical numbers were cut or rethought. The opening number in the play I Hope I Get It shows all of the dancers doing a jazz and ballet combination and then people get eliminated. In the movie they jam three hundred dancers onstage together and show them in closeup to disguise the fact that they have cast people in the film who cannot dance can you say Audrey Landers. Goodbye 12, Goodbye 13, Hello Love, a brilliant vocal exploration of these dancers childhoods jaundiced memories was reworked as Surprise, Surprise mainly a vehicle for the late Gregg Burge as Richie. The show is most famous song, What I Did for Love which in the show was a touching allegory sung by the entire cast about what they give up to dance, becomes just another standard love song in the film, performed tiredly by a miscast Allyson Reed as Cassie. Jeffrey Hornadays choreography for the film is dull and unimaginative and does not hold a candle to Michael Bennett original staging and when you are making a movie about dancers, the choreography has to be special. There are a couple of good dancers in the film, the previously mentioned Gregg Burge as Richie, Michelle Johnston as Bebe, and Janet Jones as Judy, but they are hardly given the opportunity to show what they can do, yet Audrey Landers, who can barely walk and chew gum at the same time, is given one of the show is best numbers, Dance 10, Looks 3. I will admit that the finale, One is dazzling, but you have to wait almost two hours for that.

In addition, Nicole Kidman and the supposed Russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere, probably spoken by Aliens in the Ural mountains, but far to be the Russian one.

The fairy stories contain the only bits of interest in the plot, but they are very short, and do not really seem to have any point. The first fairy story in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life, but the boy delays by tasting the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend  the grandfather then pronounces that the moral is that the boy was too impatient, but that does not make any sense because it was overcaution and slowness which resulted in his failure.

The romance and technology, beware, are as unbelievable as each other.

I have never been a big Eddie Murphy fan, so that is probably another reason I did not care for it much at all. This one has Eddie as some sort of finder of lost kids. He must find the golden child or the world is in terrible peril. The plot is very bad, but as bad as it is it does not compare to the special effects. I had seen better stuff done in the 70s than some of the stuff this one offers, Ray Harryhausen did better stuff. Still the main reason you see a movie like this is because of Eddie, unfortunately he is not very funny in this one at all and it just seems stupid to put him in the Raiders of the Lost Ark type scenes.

Kid becomes buddy with robot and robot repays the kids kindness by shooting him and a group of other kids in this camp into outer space with a very limited oxygen supply and radios that do not have the signal to reach into space. This camp is also not very fun as these kids are put to real training and the instructors get all over them for failing missions or not doing the right things. Give it a rest, they are there for fun, not to become astronauts just yet, just give them the experience of space flight not a military like camp. However, you do get to see Joaquin Phoenix in a fairly early role. So in the end a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors you might as well had the kids battle space aliens on top of everything else that was happening in the movie as that would have made the movie a bit more enjoyable at least for me.

The movie appears to be based on an earlier Italian movie according to the credits but was rewritten by two fairly popular American romantic comedy writers. But this one by Charles Shyer  Nancy Meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts. The story is about a couple of downandout traveling Americans, played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsunds return. Upon trying to return it, they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the ladys residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money. They freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder. The other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a Monte Carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story. The other cast members include character actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others.

It might be because her mother Dana is played by Rosanna Arquette, whose cute overbite, neoflowerchild sexuality and luscious figure makes me forgive her any number of bad movies or unsympathetic characters. Here Dana is not only clueless to her daughters conduct; she seems to be competing for the gold medal in the Olympic Indulgent Mother competition. It is possible that Dana misses Tracis murderous streak because truth be told, Traci seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster. It is only because the script dictates so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count.A particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of Carmen, a Mexican maid who is described by Dana as around so long she is like one of the family although she dresses in what the director thought would say, I just fell off the tomato truck from Guadalajara. Carmen is so wise to Tracis scheming, she might also wear a sign saying, Hey, I am the Next Victim! Sure enough, Traci confronts Carmen as Carmen is making her way back from Mass, and bops her with one of those slightly angled lug wrenches that car manufacturers put next to your spare as a bad joke. I rather suspect than in real life those things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are for changing a tire.

I am a big Sinatra fan including some of his acting roles but maybe the only person who could have played this part would have been Don Knotts. First off, as someone pointed out, Sinatra just does not have the build for a Western badguy wannabe. He is just too slight at this point in his life. Maybe he was about the same height as say Audie Murphy, but Murphy had a pretty solid build. Sinatra comes across as the big talking little kid who nobody ought to take seriously.The story is uninspired and really not credible. I do not want to spoil it but I think the ending and how the townspeople react in this story does not make any sense. Another thing, these people constantly allow themselves to be completely lorded over by some bad guy. This is just a little town, so I do not get the attraction nor do I understand why the people would let themselves be dominated that way.There is a love interest in the story and if I followed it right, she was upset when the main character refused to admit who he was so some other bad guy would not kill him. Now there is true love for you. Stand up for yourself! Tell him your name so he will kill you! LOL. Stop, you are killing me.Unfortunately the basic premise of the movie is not good enough and no matter how they tried this story did not have a logical path to follow other than into the wastebasket. Want to know why it is not on video and never shown on TV? The critics apparently panned it in 1956 and they were right  this movie is pretty bad. I would almost bet Sinatra paid someone to deep six the thing as much as possible.You want to see a good Western where a town stands up against a bad guy?

But he tried to do his job well in Johnny Concho, the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault. I blame it on two factors a the story was too unusual, specially in the fact that Sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie. In a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern, to break away from it the film has to be very good. b the story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow Sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother. Also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible, why all the gunfighters have not adopted it?

It is just plain bad.Molly Ringwald tried to do her best but it was not enough.","label":0},{"index":5228,"txt":"Everyone in this movie tells Raffy Carruthers how talented she is, what a great director she will one day turn out to be, etc. I think they are just being nice. Even Kimble Rendall, who directed this film, shows more talent than she does. The next Jane Campion, they call her; and, even apart from the fact that they are both overrated, the two have SO much in common. They both direct movies. They are both women. They are both Australian. Well, give or take.Yep it is one of those films in which a character is deemed to be brilliant, and we just have to swallow hard and accept it. But I will say this for Carruthers she is cute. And fascinating. No, really. Here are some thoughts on her lack of talent1 Part of a directors talent lies in dealing with people. Why is Carruthers so phenomenally bad at getting her crew to even take notice of her? So as to make it easier for everyone to wander off the set and get killed, I expect.2 Why is this one of the most unconvincing depictions of a movie set I have ever seen? After all, it must have been filmed on a REAL movie set. How could they get it wrong? If Rendalls set was half as much of an understaffed shambles it is a wonder he completed his film at all.3 Carruthers  the fictional director  has set herself the task of creating a brand new 1980s horror flick. Fat chance. I doubt it can be done these days. I suspect that Rendall  the actual, and more talented, director  set himself the same task, realised it could not be done, and settled for sigh knowing parody instead. Of course, it is not ENOUGH of a parody to work as a parody. As soon as the cast and crew set foot in the isolated mansion the film just spends most of its time doing badly what 1980s horror films did ... well, less badly.4 And yet, and yet ... the film opens with not a parody but an honesttogoodness pastiche of 80s horror, starring this is too good to be true Molly Ringwald. This pastiche is much better than anything that follows. It is a bad sign when you find yourself wishing you were watching the moviewithinthemovie, rather than the movie. Yet it, too, was filmed in the late 1990s. Perhaps it IS still possible to make 1980s horror. You just have to drop the knowing parody stuff and MEAN it.5 I would never once wondered what 1980s teen horror would be like if all the characters had Australian accents, but now I know. And strangely, I am glad I know. A need I never knew I had has been fulfilled.","label":0},{"index":5229,"txt":"This film was made and cast from my home town. I remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the fact Molly Ringwald was in town...Storyline...Essentially 20 years after a film was laid to rest without being finished, a group of film students set out to complete it  with dire consequences. It would seem someone does not want the film completed.The storyline is flimsy. One has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek, but it had no real oomph. The characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just do not care about, it seems irrelevant. It is weird hearing Kylies accent as Australian again and nice to see a kid I went to school with in a starring role. But that does not redeem the film at all. Goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in Molly Ringwald. Perhaps due to the nature of the film it sort of pays homage to 80s films  bad horror filmsbut really an Aussie actor would have done just fine.As far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed constipated. Some of these kids especially the two main chics  they played director and producer looked like they were trying to act. That is never a good look. Also, the shots had a rough feel about them. Over lit perhaps? Just not as smooth as one is used to.The killer. Lord. Could it be less frightening? There are some shock factors though, and a couple of gross scenes. I did like the film, but it was not great. It went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less. Perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better. They had a lot of characters get killed  but no real build up to them getting slayed. Maybe if they had killed less people and actually concentrated on a scary atmosphere it would have been better.Now I know it is a comedy and elements were funny. Or so unbelieveable they were funny.

Well, one charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was fantastic as the spoilt, bitchy American actress hating every minute of working with the amateur Australian film crew. She was so convincing that its tempting to believe it was not an act, although everyone involved with Cut says she was lovely to work with.

First, the way Traci kept popping up at just the right melodramatic moment, in order to see whatever she was supposed to see, and never got seen in return, was very annoying.

The characters were underdeveloped to say the least...for example, all of a sudden the man mentions Are not you trying to complete the film because your mother could not? So we are supposed to go along with this? We had no idea it was her daughter until half way through the film. The movie really did not spotlight on anyone, we did not know anything about the main people who survived except Ringwalds character was a whiney actress, the guy was on the set when the people died and Raffy wanted to be a director like her mother. Not truly diving in to know who they are. Seemed things were rushed to just get to the killings. The whole plot is entirely too weak for my taste and I was extremely disappointed.

Great idea for a film, but sadly Cut is just another wasted opportunity.Unfortunately Australia has not had the worlds best track record when it comes to horror. Razorback 1984 was an out and out dud as was Holwing III 1987, which was half an American film anyway. As for our foray into comedyhorror, Body Melt 1993 is best left forgotten. The problem with Cut is that the makers trying to create a clever horror satire a la Scream 1996 but have no insight into the genre or what makes it work. And although this sounds weird me saying this about a slasher film but what Cut really lacks is any heart. Sure it follows the basic rules established by Scream, but it does not want to play with the formula, instead it goes for a cardboard copy of the earlier.The killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic villains in horror movie history. His endless barrage awkwardly, lame oneliners would make the dialogue of a porno seem like Shakespeare. The cast never seem like their fully involved and look like their just waiting for a shoot to be over so they can collect their pay checks. And the feel of the film is like it is deliberately trying not to be creepy; looking more like an episode of Neighbors or Heartbreak High. By the way, those attempts at MTV style, hypercinema during the research sequence just look lame, dated and out of place.If Australia ever gets a chance to do horror again Which I hope we still do maybe we should take a leaf from the Mad Max 1979 book.

The film has a curse on it, because Molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set. But she is back, because she needs the exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start dying on the set. Cut is an Aussie attempt at the modern slasher, but unfortunately it does not bring anything new or exciting to the table.

So a group of filmmakers decide to pick up where the film left off even though they are warned by people to keep away from the film, as the last person who was interested in the flick turned up dead in the cinema while watching the film. From this it is labelled as a cursed production. Not taking these warnings seriously the crew goes ahead with the production and they get the original star of the movie to return from Hollywood to reprise her role, but not as the daughter but the mother. But again the murders start occurring with the cast and crew getting butchered by an unknown figure dressed up as the films killer.Look what Scream started! Hey, I enjoy those films, but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses. During this stage the subgenre came back with vengeance, but it was not much of a good thing as they were mostly unsuccessful and unoriginal attempts, where they followed the derivative pattern of the Scream franchise. Cut which is an independent Australian take on the textbook slasher genre is purely shonky garbage that lacks basically everything and shamelessly knocks off every other slasher flick. But you know what, I found it a cheesy delight. Yeah, It is gawd awful and highly forgettable, but it is a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted. Although I did hate it when I originally came across it, but the second time around I knew what I was getting myself into and it worked better for it. It was just like helping myself to a nice slice cheesecake again, but this time it was not so sweet.The film came out around the same time as Scream 3 and Urban Legends The Final Cut did, which all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie. Scream 3 is obviously the strongest of the three, but I would actually watch this trash over Urban Legends The Final Cut. Though, it did seem more of a throwback to the 80s slashers than that of one of Screams bastard offspring. Pretty much the film is given bgrade treatment and that shows up in the script and performances. The dialog is truly unimaginative and hardly comes up with any surprises and suspense. While, the performances are pure mockery and Molly Ringwald takes the crown for it. She plays the washup actress returning to finish the cursed flick and I had good fun with her laughably ridiculous sendup performance. She provides the bite here and nails it down perfectly. The rest were mostly recognizable Australian TV stars that is if you are an Australian with a ravishing Jessica Napier leading the cast with the likes of Stephen Curry and Frank Roberts. Also pop singer and supposed actress Kylie Minogue makes a cameo appearance in the opening just to be hacked up! Nice. These teens mostly followed the formula of horny and dimwitted kids that have nothing better to do but to be killed. Sometimes it feels like they just waiting in queue, because they have no real substance to be there.The plot starts off rather interestingly, then heads into a mystery phase where red herrings pop up, but then it makes a sudden uturn where it becomes a somewhat satire on the horror genre. Simply it is rather choppy and when it comes to the explanation for all of this madness I was kind of left thinking\u0085 oh my. This when it tries to twist back onto itself in a clever manner, but sadly it falls along way. But do not you just love an opening ending. Also it sports some pop culture references and a self referential, tongueincheek approach. Predictability makes its way in rather early and the jokes can become overstated at times, but it knows that by poking fun at itself quite a bit. The atmosphere looses a bit of edge because of the humour taking away the bleakness, but still the isolated grand old mansion where they are filming has some neat touches that added some spookiness. The cinema scene is done rather nicely too.Now, now we know we want gore and nudity when watching this type of flick, but sadly there is no nudity to be found and the gore is pretty standard, if lacking but it is more then decent for such lowbudget flick. There are one or two creative deaths, but the rest are systematic. The killer was not bad but when he spoke it kind of hurt it I thought, well the smartass attitude did not sit well with me. Another notes of the production which were dire ranged from the cutaway editing, outofplace soundtrack and Kimble Rendalls direction lacked execution and was pretty careless, but these contributing factors pull together to add some sort of sheer entertainment to all of this badness.The imagination matches the budget that is for sure, but heck this lousy slasher was not trying to be anything else.

In a career that is sliding rather swiftly toward tabloid obscurity, Ben Affleck, once a promising comic character actor who became enmeshed in the Hollywood publicity machine to recreate himself into a romantic leading man. Judging from this film, the transformation does not seem to be taking, as he continues to lack the gravitas that would make him credible in such parts. While his buddy Matt Damon takes on smart roles in films like Syriana, Affleck appears in this type of commercial pap. At least the superficial character of successful but lonely advertising executive Drew Latham suits Affleck better than most of the other roles he has tried.Directed by Mike Mitchell whose most famous film is 1999s Deuce Bigelow Male Gigolo and scripted by no less than four screenwriters always a bad sign, the flimsy plot revolves around his characters need to rent a family living in his childhood home in order to live out his fantasy of having the oldfashioned Christmas he never had. The concept is actually intriguing because there is something to be said about the cathartic release of sentimentality we are all directed to feel amid the frenzied commercialism around the holidays. The real problem, however, is that the movie feels like an extended sketch lacking any logic or authentic emotional resonance. Affleck seems to be on overdrive attempting desperately to be lovable, but the net result is an exhausting turn by an actor who has an increasingly annoying habit of playing stupid people in illconceived films. Fortunately, he has the likes of James Gandofini and Catherine OHara playing the Valcos, the couple who decide to accept Drews monetary offer to pretend to be his parents.Gandolfini plays Tom like a gruff, nonviolent relative of Tony Soprano, but he does what he can in the role. From her classic SCTV Days to Christopher Guests mockumentaries, OHara is always a comic gem no matter the vehicle, and unsurprisingly she earns the best laughs as Toms wife Christine, whether dryly delivering a oneliner or posing in an inch of makeup for a dominatrix photo shoot. In what is becoming her standard screen role, Christina Applegate plays their mistrusting daughter Alicia, who of course becomes Drews love interest. Despite some good moments where she is enjoying the deceit of playing Drews sister in front of his girlfriends family, her character seems to change in lightningflash strokes making it hard to see what Drew would see in her. The story spins completely out of control by the last third with one contrived situation piled on top of another until plot strands are tied together in short order.

The characters are so inconsistent and the plot makes so little sense that the movie played like a rough draft of a script thrown together with little but the oneliner concept of a rich guy paying a family to let him spend Christmas with them.Ben Affleck portrays Drew Latham, the typical Hollywood image of a wealthy, egotistical advertising executive who buys his way through life. His girlfriend, Missy, leaves him shortly before Christmas because she is disgusted that Drew wanted to take her to Fiji for Christmas, which she calls the family holiday, and the fact that Drew has never introduced her to his family. We later find out that Drews father left when he was 4 years old, and his mother is dead, so it is a mystery why he does not just say that he has no family, rather than allow his girlfriend to believe that he does not care about his family.Out of fear of being alone on Christmas, Drew tracks down Missys shrink why? I have no idea, who suggests he do a forgiveness ritual at his childhood home. When he meets the family living in his childhood home, the Valcos, Drew offers them 250,000 to pretend to be his family, so he can relive his fond childhood memories. He gets angry when he later finds out that they have an adult daughter, Alicia Christina Applegate, because he does not have a sister, and even goes so far as to write a script for the family to follow so that they act more like his real family. None of this makes any sense once Drew reveals that he grew up with no family but his mother.Also inexplicable is the character of Alicia, who is annoyed that her family accepted Drews money, and refuses to play along with his fantasy. But for no good reason, she suddenly starts to like Drew, and in a matter of minutes goes from hating his guts to acting like his girlfriend. Drew is such a complete jerk throughout the movie that even his sad story about the lonely Christmases of his childhood evokes no sympathy; I almost wish he had finished with, Just kidding! The real reason I do not see my family is that they all have restraining orders against me! 210","label":0},{"index":5262,"txt":"There is one great moment in Surviving Christmas that almost makes it worth the pain James Gandolfini cracks a shovel over Ben Afflecks stupid head.This movie serves as yet another unfortunate example of James Gandolfini proving what a great actor he is whilst simultaneously besmirching his career by acting in this film.Young and wealthy ad exec, Drew Latham Ben Affleck has been inculcated into believing that one must never be alone on Christmas. And there, from the outset, is the underlying problem with our suspension of disbelief in this idiotic movie how many people of Drews social standing, in 2004, truly care one way or another whether Christmas is spent alone or with half the family or with a fiftydollar prostitute? Storyline finds Drew buying off a family to spend Christmas with, on the condition that they pretend to be his own, insensately ignoring all the indications to the contrary that his money has not bought the emotions he was seeking.For 250,000, a surly suburban truck driver, Tom Valco James Gandolfini, and his disheveled wife, Christine Catherine OHara, agree to be Drews ad hoc family, against protests from their son, Brian a very onedimensional Josh Zuckerman and daughter, Alicia a very softfocused Christina Applegate. Drew then spends the rest of the movie supposedly recapturing his youth or  something. The messages in this movie are as twisted and illogical as its drymouthed storyline. Fraught with overt psychoses, Drew plasters a fake smile on his face and blindly remains in denial against every denigration that he was supposedly buying the Valco family to avoid.Which begs the question If Drew is paying these people to recapture some semblance of joyous familial emotion, how psychotic must he be to pretend happiness amongst their barbs and mental anguish over his presence? It is not a case of the Valco family hiding their true feelings and pretending to be happy while around Drew  three of the four members make it patently clear they despise him. Is he so incognizant that he cannot see that his money is not buying him the family atmosphere he was inculcated into believing was a truth in the first place? As with all movies this opprobrious, one wonders how four screenwriters could possibly get so tangled in their own narcissistic dreams of appearing in a credits sequence that they will overlook any semblance of plausibility, or intelligence.Director Mike Mitchell, who was responsible for Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo  stop right there. Nuff said.Gandolfini and OHara somehow manage to shine, proving their mettle amongst this mess. Christina Applegate is willowy and cutesy and blond and fiery in all the right places, scathingly cutting Drew into little strips of carcass for most of the movie, then doing an aboutface and falling in love with him because the script tells her to.And I would not go so far as to say that Affleck is a bad actor, but John Schneider better look over his shoulder.

I guess that way Angelopoulos can show some social awareness, while dealing with the existentially troubled upperclasses. I mean honestly, the scene where some topranking armyofficer curses his destiny cause he sent his daughter to study in London is enough to make you puke.Anyway, it cannot be that bad, Angelopoulos is a master of the cinematic art after all, right ?

It is like a 15 minutes monologue, killing the action and viewers patience, nothing happening on screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, apart this old lady telling a story. All that is presumed to be shown through action, was simply told to the camera by the old lady. In a moment, the equippe of TV was heading to the bar.

A lot of problems with the storytelling, it went from absurd to irrational never sticking to a style, making the viewer asking questions that never got answers. Poor Mastroianni, given a role which lacked integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many Greeks or Albanians or Balcan people would agree with, the movies showed lot of historic, ethnic, or politically incorrectness, just for the sake of making a movie about humanity as a red in another review.

Connery is clearly slowing down in his old age, barely bothering with his attempt at a US accent and besides seems too old to be the husband of Hope Lange and the father of those gosh  darn kids of his. He even has a father in law who seems younger than him. Laurence Fishburne barely gets the chance to inhabit his role and you are confused from the outset as to whether he is a bad guy or a good guy.

She is one of those really cute comedians that men especially flock to, saying that they dig her intelligence and wit. But if you corner them, most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her, and that is why they watch her. She reminds me of why many men flocked to Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, even though neither of them are really hot now in terms of popularity. Sarah does not drink or smoke at least cigs, so she should be hot when she is 60, so her fans especially the male ones can rejoice.As for this show, it is very much like her comedy. When it works, it is hilarious. When it does not, it is full blown tedium and very, very boring. The AIDS episode here is the best one. It is consistently funny, and has some really good satire in it. Brian Poeshns character has an unhealthy obsession with Tab in one episode, and it is hilarious seeing him in a Tab Tshirt. But they never really go anywhere with it, and it eventually wears out its welcome. Sarahs character in the series is rather annoying, the gay couple Brian Poeshn and some other guy seems tacked on and never really does anything for the show as a whole, and the supporting players including Sarahs real life sister, Laura, who does not look a thing like her are OK.

An exploitation film perpetrated by the vilest of people. As time accrued their filmmaking reputation has been seriously stained by what they did here. Their reputation as human beings is execrable. That is what people will remember them as. Grotesque hustlers.","label":0},{"index":5286,"txt":"Despite the overwhelming cult following for this sad documentary, I must admit to having cordially loathed the film which struck our party as far more a distressing exploitation piece than usefully informative. That said, after seeing the magnificent stage musical drawn from it, one can appreciate what the film might have been in surer hands. One suspects that those many of us who actively suffered through the film may have had any campy delights its crueler fans enjoyed destroyed by the uncomfortable suspicion that too many of us  or those we know  are only a misstep or two away from the deplorable plight of the two mad women depicted who live in and contribute to a squalor they seem incapable of controlling or escaping.The film leaves the viewer desperately wondering how any person could have slid to this level of degradation and, unlike the musical, offers no cautionary clues or explanations, only a horror show unredeemed by humor or insight. This soul crushing flatness of the film makes the achievement of the stage version hopefully to be filmed ultimately for cable all the more remarkable. Act II is faithful in almost every detail to the film under discussion but strangely, setting the sad inmates plight to music, raises the human tragedy to art. Even more important, this act is preceded by a fine Act I where we meet the women before their decent into mutually enabled madness, and are offered hints how their isolated purgatory came about. In short, everything which the FILM is lacking.To the filmmakers credit or their successors, the excellent Criterion DVD release includes outtakes and bonus material that partially redeem the main film  behind the scenes photographs, interviews and commentary  filling in some of the blank spots the original editing consciously decided to omit in its drive for unadulterated horror and depression. They cannot make the amateurish film itself satisfying, but they can at least make it a bit more comprehensible. Ultimately though, it is only the remarkable stage piece inspired by and drawn from it by book writer Doug Wright, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie which raises the rating of the original GREY GARDENS above a single generous star.","label":0},{"index":5287,"txt":"Somewhere inside this movie is a halfhour episode from The Twilight Zone trying to get out. Whereas Cube was taut, wellmade, claustrophobic and mindengaging, I am afraid Cypher is a bloated, tedious rehash of several wellworn themes which just do not add up to much, especially if you have seen almost any other halfway decent scifi film before.Cypher manages to drag all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes right to the incompetent ending. None of the characters spark off each other, and for a film made in 2002 the technology is truly cheesy. It is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of Cube. It is not a bad movie, but it is most definitely not a good one.When you have watched the grass grow and paint dry and are bored of your stick insects then by all means watch this film, but the other activities will probably prove more stimulating.","label":0},{"index":5288,"txt":"The performances of Fishbourne who appears strangely funny somehow and short featuredEd Harris are remarkable, unlike Connerys who does not appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the motorial behaviour of a 80yr old man.

It is more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screenwrights schools. The more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets.

I cannot say I found the acting all that impressive either. It was pretty bad. Not Star Wars prequel trilogy bad, but bad nonetheless.I am not sure what the running time was, I will assume two hours because it is a safe estimate. Anyway, when the film was finished, I felt as though I deserved some kind of recognition for the will power I exerted in not stopping the film and walking away halfway through.Again, I was thoroughly unimpressed, and eventually bored out of my wits.

Why? Cypher is a cheap, derivative, dull movie, set in a poorly realised bland futureworld, with wooden leads, and a laughable ending.An eerie sense that something interesting might be about to happen keeps you watching a series of increasingly silly and unconvincing events, before the film makers slap you in the face with an ending that combines the worst of Bond with a Duran Duran video.It is painfully obvious they have eked out the production using Dr Who style improvised special effects in order to include a few good if a little Babylon 5 CGI set pieces.

There are some things to admire in it; for one thing it deserves credit for being a science fictionish film which relies on its story instead of special effects and action sequences to carry the day. The supporting cast is good, the set design and cinematography are good, and the ideas are interesting enough though they are beginning to seem a little tired after the many mediocre Dark City  Memento  Fight Club clones of recent years. But the film is undone by poor characterization, wooden performances from the lead actors, and a laughably bad ending.The main problem I had was that the protagonist was neither likable nor unlikable. I realize that part of the story dictates that he should be a bit of a wait for it... cipher, but I was utterly unable to work up any empathy for a character that just seemed like a boring, anonymous schlub of a man. What character transformation there is for this sad sack is artificially forced on him by the plot. Lead actor Jeremy Northam succeeds in conveying that the protagonist is confused and hapless, but fails at inspiring any sympathy for him. Opposite him, Lucy Liu does what she can with a character who has no real personality of her own, unless being the embodiment of a spymovie clich\u00e9 counts as personality.One of the biggest disappointments of this movie is the ending. I will not give any spoilers here, but I will say that a surprise twist at the end was telegraphed pretty clearly at least 45 minutes before it occurred. Further, after being content to be a quirky, ideaoriented movie for the first hour or so, the last few scenes suddenly and terribly devolve into the worst kind of Hollywood pap, complete with big explosions and special effects. The revealing of the films McGuffin at the end is poorly done, and at the end the characters seem even less likable than they did before some of the films main plot threads were resolved.The movies not all bad, though. It does manage to maintain a certain low level of tension throughout most of it, despite the slow pacing although I think I have a higher than average tolerance for slowpaced movies. And there are some moments when the unsettled, paranoiac feeling that director Vincenzo Natali was clearly trying to evoke rises to the surface. But in the end, these elements are not enough to overcome the flaws in the films acting and script. There is probably a good movie that covers these same themes and ideas, but this is not it.","label":0},{"index":5292,"txt":"Jeremy Northam struggles against a Total Recall clone script and disposable romantic byplay to bring life to a confused character. Lucy Liu graduates her acting from a wooden start to a workmanlike finish. You cannot fail to laugh when viewing her interviews on the DVD when she uses the term Femme fatal and Romance. French filmnoir actress she is not and they lack chemistry together.This movie fails, not in the plot or the action sequences but in the lack of attention to detail in the films photography and hamfisted portrayal of the world of technology surrounding the main protagonists. Little attempt is made to dress the scenery to represent any contiguous filmic landscape or period. Automobiles are very 1990s and the architecture barely modern with open plans that hint at a restricted budget rather than conscious set dressing techniques.The technology is positively hilarious. Massive 2001 A Space Odyssey mainframes fed by manportable CDROMs with data collected for some unexplained reason, in spite of the proliferating communications network that even the most unsavvy technologist today would obviously be aware. There is an obvious lack of research done here and given the opensource nature of the cybercommunity, research would have cost little more than a bulletin board and personal time.DVD interviews also reveal the original movie name was Company Man but this likely ditched in order to cash in on Matrix hype.

I could be wrong about the second instance but I replayed it several times and that is what it looks like to me. The third case is when the Anne Shirley character wishes the OBrien character goodbye and good luck Give em hell over the roar of the engines. She must have thought that was too unladylike because she clearly says heck. I also found interesting the character that has moral problems with bombing, specifically bombing civilians. The avuncular superior officer assures him that only military targets will be hit due to the precision of the bombsight used. Given what we know about the LeMays later strategy of firebombing Japanese cities into oblivion this scene plays with not a little irony. I remember McNamaras quoting of LeMay in The Fog of War, something to the effect that if the US did not win the conflict he would be tried as a war criminal.

Unlike Harlins Elm Street 4, and Die Hard 2 which I really liked, there is something that is missing from this movie. That, my friends, is a script. The dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful, but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity. There are so many awful lines in this movie, I do not even want to have to remember any of them. Not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure. It is almost like Harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said, they could improve the script. Wrong again.The sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue. Stallone has never been a favorite of mine, but when he is acting circles around Lithgow, Turner, and the worst of the bunch Rooker, there is something wrong with this picture. Lithgow played one of the best villains in Ricochet, yet comes across as someone who cannot act to save his life here. How is that possible? I have always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by Stallone, who himself still phonedin his performance. Turners part is so small and pointless, but she still manages to appear lost on screen. Michael Rooker CAN act. I know this because I have witnessed it in Days of Thunder, but he seems like he is READING his lines from cue cards. Has it come to this? When Rooker and Lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking, I just wanted the movie to end right there, or have them both amazingly find their acting ability. Unfortunately, neither of those things occurred.Which brings me back to Harlin, who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters. It is his fault that I was never drawn into this movie at all, because he should have made the people actually act. The script is not very good, but still the actors performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director. I do not care how much was paid for the special effects, which for the most part are good, you still cannot just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting. Plus, the pacing of this movie seems to be off. The opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done, but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all. I mean I understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene, but I really did not care if they got the money or not in that scene.

Furthermore, the plot has no real twists at all, a three year old kid could guess what comes next.

After watching Revolver one could be excused for thinking were did it all go wrong? What happened to his great sense of humour? Where did he get all these mixed and convoluted ideas from? Revolver tries to be clever, philosophical and succinct, it tries to be an intelligent psychoanalysis, it tries to be an intricate and complicated thriller. Ritchie does make a gargantuan effort to fulfil all these many objectives and invests great chunks of a script into existential musings and numerous plot twists. However, in the end all it serves is to construct a severely disjointed, unstructured and ultimately unfriendly film to the audience. Its plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that although Ritchie does at least attempt to give his own spin he should be punished for even trying to pass it off as his own work. So what the audience gets ultimately is a terrible screenplay intertwined with many pretentious oneliners and clumsy setpieces.Revolver is ultimately an unoriginal and bland movie that has stolen countless themes from masterpieces like Fight Club, Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. It aims high, but inevitably shots blanks aplenty.Revolver deserves to be lambasted, it is a truly poor film masquerading as a wannabe masterpiece from a wannabe auteur.

However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie known in some circles as Mr. Madonna, utilizes the Soze motif in a far more obsequious manner. Jason Statham with a highly questionable head of hair stars as Jack Green known to all as Mr. Green. He may or may not also be criminal mastermind Mr. Gold.

I wanted to like Green as I always enjoy Stratham as a character who is two steps ahead of everyone else.

And this is a very, very big but. The XXL elephantsized megabut to end all buts.PLEASE do not confuse incoherence for complexity, and please do not confuse this two hour nonsquirter for an interesting film. Really. You may think you are pretty smart. You may even think of yourself as somewhat of a romantic figure an independent thinker championing a masterpiece against a chorus of sheeplike naysayers. Please do not. You are embarrassing yourself. Revolvers a waste of everyones time. If you thought about if for a few minutes, you would recognise it too. It was a waste of the cast, a waste of the crew, a waste of the caterers, and definitely a waste of the precious minutes you cannot get them back you know of anyone unlucky enough to sit through this unutterable, wretched mess.No  wait, comes a voice in the darkness. You just do not understand. Its NONLINEAR. That means the story does not go in a STRAIGHT LINE. This is actually the COMPLEX and SUBTLE work of an AUTEUR. It addresses difficult EXISTENTIAL questions. And anyway  they slated FIGHT CLUB when it first came out  did not you hear? Because they could not deal with the COMPLEXITY. They are eating humble pie now. Bet you hate Lynch films too, doncha? Hate to disappoint you, but I am quite a big Lynch fan. I rather like Memento, so a narrative told in an unconventional fashion does not necessarily fill me with fear. And although I have only studied it briefly a few years ago, philosophy interests me greatly. I do not dislike Revolver for these reasons. I dislike it because it purports to be about weighty, bigbrained topics but deals with them in such an insultingly superficial way as to be laughable. I am not much of a chess player, but Richies idea of how chess works seems to be that of a precocious four year old. I dislike it because the characters, without exception, totally alienated me. Aha! cries the Richie apologist. Guy is cleverly tipping his hat to Brecht! Just maybe you are right. I think its more likely that he just cannot write a decent script for toffee.Comparing Revolver with Fight Club is actually really instructive. Fight Club has acidtongued, nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh. Revolver has stale fortune cookie reject oneliners that make your ears bleed. Fight Club has a great twist that makes you reassess everything that has happened. Revolver has, as far as I can tell, several incomprehensible twists that offer no satisfaction because... well, they do not make sense. If you keep pulling the rug out from under people, they eventually kick you out of their house. And then they lock all the doors and windows. And they never let you back in. Ever.Guy Richie seems to assume that being philosophical entails repeating a mantra of little buzzphrases. Mostly they are spoken, but often they flash up on the screen with attributions. It is almost pathological.But what makes this film particularly notable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can be married so neatly with all tired gangster clich\u00e9s in the world. Ultimately its so inconsequential. You do not care about anything. You do not understand anything. You go home.Actually, there was a bit I really liked the uptight assassin who has a crisis of confidence. He is great. But I cannot recommend you see the film just to see him. He is only in it for a few minutes.Please believe me. It is horrible.","label":0},{"index":5317,"txt":"I do not think I have ever felt this let down by a film before. After loving Guy Ritchies two previous films I do not count Swept Away  he was pussy blind, I was so looking forward to seeing this. The reviews were poor, then again, I do not trust the press anyway. More worrying was the fact that the internet buzz was that this was a bit of a stinker, so it was with some trepidation I handed over my \u00a34.80 yesterday afternoon.I am not even going to try to explain this film, mainly because I have not got a clue what was going on and at one point I was honestly close to standing up and asking if it was just me who did not get it! Unfortunately I think Ritchie seems to have fallen into his wifes trap of taking himself far too seriously.It seems it was not good enough for him to make films with good plots, laughs, snappy dialogue and good characters. It is almost as if he had a checklist of films he wanted to rip off, here are some of the ones I noticedThe Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, The Usual Suspects, Vanilla Sky...I think the most frustrating thing is that the performances from the two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were actually very good and it was really the self indulgent story and editing  direction that let the film down.So a big, big thumbs down from me.","label":0},{"index":5318,"txt":"Was convincing the world that he did not exist...This is a line that is probably remembered by a lot of people.

It starts out so well, with really fantastic cinematography, great acting and a very smart premise. But alas, the only way this movie is heading is on a course of selfdestruction. And it does so, not by a single blow but with nagging little wristcuts.Pay no attention to the comments here that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain this donut. With enough booze in my brain I would probably be capable of explaining the very existence of mankind to a very plausible degree. I have seen and read about a dozen totally different ways people explained the story. And they vary from a story set totally in someones head, playing chess with himself, to a cunning way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means resembling chess gaming.And that is all jolly swell. But at the same time it is a painful giveaway that there is something terribly wrong with this story. And apart from that, it is in any case a blunt rip off of a score of movies and books like Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, The Usual Suspects, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle. And we are not dealing with kind borrowing here, it is a blatant robbery.What ultimately goes wrong here in this movie is that the storyline swirls like a drunk bum on speed. If this movie was a rollercoaster ride, you would have crashed into the attraction next to it shorty after take off. There are so many twists in this movie which will never be resolved, that if it was a cocktail, you would be needing a life supply of hurlbuckets to work of the nausea after drinking it. Nothing is ever explained and when you finally get some grasp of the direction you think it is going, you get pulled in yet another one.I guess this story was not going anywhere on paper and Ritchy must have thought that is was awesome to make a movie out of it anyway, being the next David Lynch or something.110 for totally violating ones own work Ritchy seek professional help.

Revolver is so monstrously bad I am actually thinking about recommending friends to go and see it, just so I do not feel like I am the only one stupid enough for being conned into watching this. Its really quite amazing how much this film falls completely on its face with the constant, and I mean CONSTANT voice overs of the main characters, with totally inane pretentious nonsense! I was actually getting angry in the cinema listening to Andre Benjamins utterly relentless droning for what seemed like half the film, whilst all the time thinking  what would Turkish have done to this complete joke of gangstercon man, whatever he is supposed to be, when he made his offer? I will tell you what. He would have told him to fk off, blown his head away, and watch with utter disdain as his equally inept partner waddles away as fast as his chubby little legs would carry him. I mean what are we supposed to believe is going through Jakes head when they offer him their solution to his problem? They are con men, therefore they must obviously also have the skill to cure incurable blood diseases! I mean ffs. Does not he start to wonder why his symptoms are not getting worse? Does not the penny drop on the third day what is happening instead of Richie subjecting the audience to a painfully patronising phone call from Avi to Jake to let him know he is been conned. Anyway, I can add a small positive note to the film by moving on to the dry humour if provides, thankfully of a similar standard to his previous films\u0085\u0085. bullst! This film does not try anything as smart as redeeming itself through some well timed amusing lines, oh no. It somehow managed to be so disastrously unfunny I genuinely did not hear so much as a titter from a completely packed cinema \u0096 and anyone who knows the UGC in Sheffield knows how full a main screen can get, and not 1 person so much as smiled. Maybe he never wanted the film to be funny, and fair enough you can still make good gangster films without comedy, but what was he planning on hanging this film on may I ask? The unnecessarily baffling plot!?? I sincerely hope not!By far the most satisfying moment I went through last night was hearing the very loud sighing coming from ALL directions of the audience as everyone desperately prayed for the film to end. It was also really quite amusing watching just how fast patrons were fighting and dashing for the exits after they realised it was over, and they were free from their torment!I will round this off I have got to finish, writing this is making me angry again by elaborating on the end.

By the last third, you know you are being lead down a blind alley, and tediously slowly at that.Cons, chess and game theory are all great subjects, but Ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to make much use of the material.The only thing that keeps the movie almost watchable is Ritchies bold way with with a scene and MauriceJoness dynamic camera. If Ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot, and succumbed to tighter editing, there is no reason why he could not have made another enjoyable gangster caper.As it is, Revolver is a waste of your time.

Connery is fine as is Fishbourne, but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality. And the ending is simply bizarre. The film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have Thanksgiving dinner, so to compensate they added an overloud dramatic score. Every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point where it becomes laughable.

The high point of this mess of a movie is the bit in the restaurant, where the dialogue gets turned down in favour of a superbly shot, slowmo shootout set to Beethovens Moonlight Sonata. All in all, Revolver is a flawed work, not truly awful but far from Richies best. That would still be Lock, Stock.

Guy Ritchie, a director known for his reworking of the gangster genre, bites off more than he can chew with this one.His use of modern film noir to tackle the theme of a man setting himself free by swallowing his pride, being nice to his enemy  giving away all his money falls flat on it is face. When Jason Stathams character no longer fears Ray Liotta, it apparently drives Liotta crazy enough to blow his head off in the final scene. Why? Basically you cannot set up a mafiosi like the Liotta character, who has presumably got to his station in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behaviour evident throughout the film, only then to have him driven to suicide by nothing more than a pitying smile on the face of Stathams character.Before anyone starts to say I am missing the point... I am not. I get it OK? Opt out of the quest for riches  you will find true happiness and inner peace. Be nice to your enemy and this will confuse him into selfdestruction. This seems to be the gist of the movie and in itself this is not a bad premise for a story, although hardly original. The problem is that Ritchie simply does not have the skill as a movie maker to carry it off. At the moment when even Guy Ritchie realises this, he appears to get bored with the story and begins to insert redherrings The scene when Statham gets knocked over by a car  Why? The shooting of some scenes as Marvel comic animations... again, why?There are so many loose threads  unanswered questions left at the end of the movie you could get all 2001ish about it and try figuring them out, or simply accept that there are no answers  each viewer will interpret things in their own way.

See it if you are at all interested in Elmore Leonard or John Frankenheimer, or anyone in the terrific cast, especially John Glover who is admittedly brilliant.

Shifting the scene from the original locale in the book, Detroit an area where Leonard has resided for years and knows very well, to Los Angeles makes for a substantial problem that Leonard tries to fix in his script, but ultimately cannot. It was, for example, a clever device making Mitchells wife a City Councilwoman she had no job in the book, if you think about it that is the only way you could ever plausibly blackmail someone in a sexcrazed city like 1980s Los Angeles for adultery, or any type of potential sex scandal. Even then, it is more plausible in a more conservative Eastern state like Michigan to believe that a its tiny porno industry is a sleazy, moneygrubbing hell where three losers could desperately set up a notsostupid uppermiddleclass fellow going through a midlife crisis, and b adultery alone might be something you could blackmail someone with, if their upstanding careers and oldfashioned wives could not handle the shock. As consultant Ron Jeremy will tell you, 1980s Los Angeles was a colorful, stylish porno Mecca, more like the movie Boogie Nights than Leonards dark, shadowy world of hijacked tourist buses, grimy apartments, and drug deals in depressed urban squalor. Then again, Los Angeles could be the backdrop of such a tale if one arranged the scenery more carefullythere are still plenty of dark crannies and psychopaths there. Unfortunately, Roy Scheiders Harry Mitchell comes off in the film as a sexy, handsome Uebermensch dancing through his problems without even working up a sweat. In the book he was fending off a jerk union official while struggling with a business that was failing. He also had a skeleton in the closet during the war involving friendly fire that he was responsible for, but never appeared to come to grips with. Elmore Leonards stories usually have a central image involving a bizarre civility between criminal and lawabiding citizen. Here, Harry Mitchell sitting in his office with his blackmailer, Alan Raimy, turning over his financial books to him and negotiating a more practical ransom, makes for such a central image. Glovers blackmailer plays the scene with convincing intelligence, but Scheider portrays the victim here as a cocky good guy, in charge of the situation as if he were more a Rambo with an M16 than the everyman barely staying afloat as his world crumbles around him. 52 Pick Up ends with one of the worst throwaway conclusions ever, considering all the thought that went into the original story and then the film. Trapping Raimy inside Mitchells Jaguar and blowing him up with marching band music blasting out along with a sadistic monologue by Mitchell, plays to an audience wanting the sweet revenge conclusion of a Chuck Norris movie, not the intelligent balanced world of Leonards book, where Mitchell barely escapes in the end and the conflict between good and evil could easily go either way.

Not only is Tony a womanizing adulterer, he is also an unrepentant murdering scumbag, with a crew of Saturday Night Live skitworthy caricatures for subordinates. It is not the fact that Tony is a piece of sht mobster that offends me and apparently only me. Allowing characters to be who and what they are, without judgment, is something American TV hardly allows. But Chase  and his entourage of moneygorged, Emmygored writers  have not simply allowed us to observe Tony and his crew as they behave, nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action  reaction reality of even obviously fictionalized organized crime a la The Godfather. Instead, Chase glorifies and endorses his characters greedy, violent, and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that Tony, his wife, and even his hairbrained psychologist do week after week or should I say month after month. Or is it year after year? It seems like the show is paltry 13episode seasons come out with the same regularity as a lunar eclipse. Much has been made of the series refusal to adhere to network structure, with plot lines that go nowhere, and characters that popup and disappear like backyard vermin.

From the bleak New York City atmosphere, which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place, to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality, this movie is a real downer. Why it won the Academy Award was because it was so shocking at that time that Hollywood, brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned, wanted to celebrate that fact. Filmmakers then were like an immature sixyearold with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store. So, Hollywood gave theater viewers for probably the first time a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealing....and then awarded its work. It also hoped, I am sure, to shock mainstream audiences. Well, it succeeded on that level. Audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the Academy, proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time, could not help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbage.Forty years ago, as a very young man, I found this film fascinating, too. However, seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth I never watched to view it again. The acting was good, but so what? Acting is good in many films. Nobody ever said Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight could not act. Hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wackedout people. He was kind of like the Johnny Depp of his era, playing guys like Ratso Rizzo in this film and then going to be the Rain Man later on. Yes, Ratso is a character you will never forget, and Joe Buck Voight is one you want to forget, but the story is so sordid, it overwhelms the fine acting.This movie is not art, and it is not worthy of its many awards; it only pushed the envelope bigtime in 1969 and that is why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics. It is two hours of profanity and ultrasleazy, religious cheap shots, glorifying weirdos Andy Warhol even gets in the act  no surprise, and generally despicable people.I did like the catchy song, Everybodys Talking that helped make Harry Nilsson famous, but even that was bogus because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better, before Nilsson did it....and few people have ever heard of Neil which is their loss.

Even the stupid big redherring used throughout the movie would not convince a 5 year old. And I figured out the secret identity of the incubus the moment I saw the character, so when the shocking surprise ending arrived, I was not shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that I kept on chuckling days after I saw the movie. It is so silly!Anyway, the film is so bythenumber that the rock band sequence is one of the few standout moments in this dreary flick. It is a standout scene not necessarily because it is good but because it is so funny and pointless the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock videolike moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously fake long hair cut, all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theaters washroom by the incubus.

For the uninitiated, John Cassavettes was an actor, screen writer and director married to actress Gena Rowlands, nominated for Oscars three times, who wrote and directed a variety of good lowbudget films using his income as an actor to keep himself afloat. Up until seeing The Incubus, we did not understand that John Cassavetes income was made from any movie that was offered to him. Had we known what the film was about before seeing it we may have avoided altogether. But we did not walk out. At the time, my friend and I jokingly indicated it was the worst movie ever made. Now frankly, this is not true. I have seen many poorly made films on Friday nights on Cinemax did I just say that out loud? that are far worse than The Incubus. Almost any movie starring Brian Bosworth is by definition a worse movie than The Incubus. Certainly Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a worse movie than The Incubus.

The movie has something to do with a series of rapemurders going on in a small town, with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in. Somehow, the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene, and Cassavetes seems visibly P.O.ed at times.

He, John Cassavetes of Rosemarys Baby, talks about ruptured uterus, dry intercourse and massive loads of reddish ? sperm like they are the most common little ailments in the world of medicine. That being said, Incubus is an ultimately STRANGE horror effort. It is not necessarily awful \u0096 although it is not very good, neither \u0096 but just plain weird. The muddled  incoherent script initially revolves on the hunt for a rapistkiller of flesh and blood even though the title clearly suggests the involvement of a supernatural creature and it never seems to stop introducing new characters. None of these characters, especially not the main ones, come across as sympathetic and for some neverexplained reason they all seem to keep dark secrets. The aforementioned doctor has an odd interpretation of daughterlove and continuously behaves like he is a suspect himself, the towns sheriff John Ireland appears to be in a constant state of drunkenness and does not even seem to care about who keeps raping  killing the women in his district, the female reporter is even too weird for words and the Galens an old witch and her grandson are just plain spooky. All together they desperately try to solve the mystery of whom or what exactly is destroying the towns women reproducing organs. The sequences building up towards the rapes  murders are admirably atmospheric and the vile acts themselves are bloody and unsettling. Basically these are very positive factors in a horror film, but the narrative structure is too incoherent and the characters are too unsympathetic for Incubus to be a really good film. Also, there are quite a few tedious parts to struggle yourself through like footage of a Bruce Dickinson concert! and the usually very reliable John Houghs direction is nearly unnoticeable. The final shot is effectively nightmarish, though. For me personally, Incubus was a bit of a disappointment, but there are still several enough reasons to recommend this odd piece of early 80s horror to openminded genre fanatics.","label":0},{"index":5341,"txt":"Based on Ray Russells dark bestseller, this John WATCHER IN THE WOODS Houghdirected bust has little going for it.Though it does not lack gory violence, it lack narrative sensibility and characters.The Incubus of the title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into vaginas during intercourse  or, to be more precise, rape.John Cassavetes, moonlighting from his successful directing career, is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women.Horrific possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are not considered  and neither is the audiences tolerance for slow moving garbage.The scripts reluctance to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major problems with this vapid BigSchlongOnTheLoose exercise.","label":0},{"index":5342,"txt":"A young couple Mandy Pullman Mitch Martin and Roy Seeley Matt Birman are relaxing on a beach in the small town of Galen.

Nothing interesting or exciting happens and it finishes with one of the most boring none event of a twist ending I have ever seen and frustratingly it just finishes suddenly. As the story plods along at a snails pace there are a few rapes, but none are shown on screen. There is only one gore scene in the entire film too. The monster itself is only shown at the very end and has all of three short scenes. Everything about this film productionwise is very static and flat, the film has no energy or pace.

The movie has a nice feel to it at first, with the family moving to the country, and creepy old Fred Gwyne greeting and warning them of the pet cemetery, but this plot leads nowhere. It starts with so much potential, but by the end, it loses the potential to be a good horror movie, and becomes corny, extremely stupid, and ultimately depressing.Louis Dale Midkoff, his wife Rachel Denise Crosby, their kids Ellie and Gage, and their cat move to a new home in Maine. They are warned by the loony farmer neighbor Jud Fred Gwyne about the local pet cemetery and how it is cursed. Louis thinks nothing of this and everythings fine until the family cat is killed.

One day, infant Gage runs out in the road and is run over and killed by a truck, and Louis knows he must bury him in the cemetery. When Gage comes back to life, he is changed and wants to murder.With many of Stephen Kings works that do not translate well into films, I blame the directors and screenwriters. In this case, Mr. King was the screenwriter, but I am going to blame him for his awful story. By the end it is so pointless, and though unfunny, the premise is laughable. A little boy comes back from the dead and manages to kill people with what looks like a tiny scalpel, and not only that, but he manages to lift their bodies and in one case, carry a body from the ground to the attic!? I know this is not set in reality but seriously, how stupid can this get? The scene where Louis injects his deceased, now living again cat to kill it is strangely sad, because the cat did not deserve this. All it did was go around minding it is own business and he killed it. The scene where he injects his own infant son is almost unbearable. Not unbearably sad, but the whole situation is just awful to think of. After being injected Gage staggers drunkenly around before falling down dead....why did they need to make a movie ending with the death of an infant?

Critics usually point first to the actors as the problem whenever a film proves disappointing, but this is grossly unfair; the scriptwriters and director are far more often the guilty parties. The real problem with The Lonely Lady is that the screenplay, like the original book, looks for sensation rather than substance, and nothing can help with this. \tThe screenplay for this film is abysmal, but whether the story could have been filmed more successfully with a better script, tauter directing and really competent acting must remain a matter of personal judgement.

It turns out that Blair IS a psychotic psycho and that he used white guilt to enlist Connery. He concocted the story with Ed Harris in return for Blair carrying out a few murders for Harris.now Blair is on the loose again, thanks to Connerys deluded PC principles!

In any case, poor Lloyd could have been snarling that line at the speechless audience as much as he was his putupon costar.Hard as it is for most of us to believe, especially these days, nobody in Hollywood sets out to INTENTIONALLY make a bad movie. This is certainly not the most defensible argument to make, since there just seem to be so damn many of them coming out. But then again, there is that breed of film that one must imagine during the time of its creation, from writing, casting and direction, must have been cursed with the cinematic equivalent of trying to shoot during the Ides of March.THE LONELY LADY is in that category, and represents itself very well, considering the circumstances. Here we have all the ingredients in a recipe guaranteed to produce a monumentally fallen souffl\u00e9 Pia Zadora, a marginal singeractress so determined to be taken seriously, that she would take on practically anything that might set her apart from her peers, which this movie most certainly did!; a somewhat highprofile novel written by the Trashmaster himself, Harold Robbins of THE CARPETBAGGERS and DREAMS DIE FIRST fame; a cast who probably thought they were so fortunate to be working at all, that they tried to play this dreck like it was Clifford Odets or Ibsen; plus a director who more than likely was a hired gun who kept the mess moving just to collect a paycheck, and was probably contractually obligated NOT to demand the use of the Alan Smithee moniker to protect what was left of his reputation.

Nobodys sure how it came to be, how it was ever released in even a single theater, or why it is still here and nearly impossible to get rid of, but take it or leave it, it IS here to stay.

As far as Buddy being portrayed as becoming aggressive, this was total fiction and at no time did the gorilla, in real life, resort to such behavior. buddy did, in fact, escape his wooden crate not a plush cage room as depicted in movie during a storm, to seek shelter and comfort in the house, which frightened Gertrude Lintz into selling him.

Earl claims that his confession to the crime was obtained under duress by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is Blair Sullivan, a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders. Armstrong visits Sullivan in his cell on death row, hoping to persuade him to confess to Joanies murder, thereby saving Earl from the electric chair. At first all goes well. Sullivan confesses and Earl is released from prison when the appeal court quashes his conviction. As this development takes place only a little after halfway through the film, it is at this point that alarm bells will start ringing in the mind of the viewer. Warning! Major plot twist ahead! And so it proves. The anticipated twist soon materialises. Earl, it transpires, is actually guilty of the crime of which he has just been acquitted, and probably of several others as well, but hatched a diabolical plan together with Sullivan in order to secure his freedom; Sullivan will confess to Joanies murder if Earl will murder his parents. Just why Sullivan wanted his parents dead is never precisely explained. Armstrong now finds that he is himself in danger from the man whose life he has just saved; Earl has a grudge against Armstrongs wife, herself a lawyer, who acted as Counsel for the prosecution in an earlier case when Earl was accused of rape. Just Cause is an example of the autocannibalism in which Hollywood sometimes likes to indulge, cobbling together one film by recycling themes and plot devices from a number of others. The first half owes an obvious debt to films like Intruder in the Dust and To Kill a Mockingbird; about the only difference is that the Sheriff who beats a confession out of Bobby Earl is himself black, whereas in earlier films he would have been white. Police brutality is now an equal opportunities activity. The central twist in the plot was borrowed from CostaGavrass Music Box, although in that film the revelation does not occur until the very end. The finale, in which a lawyer, his wife and their young daughter are in danger from a former client, is an obvious plagiarism of the two versions of Cape Fear, which also take place in the swamplands of the American South. Ed Harris characterisation of Sullivan as a Biblequoting religious maniac is a direct imitation of Robert de Niros character in the Scorsese version of Cape Fear, made four years before Just Cause. There is a postscript. Just as Just Cause borrowed heavily from several other movies, seven years later its central plot twist was, in its turn, to be blatantly plagiarised in the Ashley Judd vehicle High Crimes. The trouble with this style of filmmakingbynumbers is that the resulting films are generally much less distinguished than those which inspired them. The whole is normally very much less than the sum of the parts, and Just Cause is a much lesser film than any of those which were cannibalised to make it. Harris is normally a gifted actor but this is one of his weakest performances, largely because he is not so much playing a character as playing de Niro playing Max Cady. Blair Underwood is OK as Bobby Earl the supposedly innocent young man of the early scenes, but unconvincing as Bobby Earl the murderous psychopath of the later ones. Sean Connery as Armstrong and Laurence Fishburne as the black Sheriff are rather better, but neither is good enough to save the film. Connery and Harris were to act together in another, better, film, The Rock, the following year. There is another problem with Just Cause. The first half of the film looks like a standard liberal issue movie, antideath penalty, antiracist and critical of heavyhanded policing. The second half looks more like the work of a diehard reactionary, preaching the message that all criminals are evil bastards, that the only way to deal with them is to fry them in the chair, that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal fraternity and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be commended as heroes. The filmmakers seem to have been blissfully unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the presumably unwanted effect of reversing its political stance, or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it. A suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political consistency. 410","label":0},{"index":5377,"txt":"How low can someone sink while trying to recapture an old glory? STHF will be glad to show you.If you are used to seeing what made for a good Star Trek show, do NOT watch this.The writing is hodgepodge, the actors portrayals of their characters weak, and most of all, the design work is downright doggy.Like watching strong captains, do not look here! Like the strong Federation attitude? Forget about it here! Starfleet is mocked by ensigns wearing SPIKES in their hair.While a seemingly mentally feeble captain shuffles about and within two minutes of the opening show is credits, Ensign Spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an engineer. It just degrades from there. No, not even uniforms match, for goodness sake. They are too small or too big, collars down to their chests, and TNG Seasons One and Two Uniforms mixed in with Season Three and DS9 uniforms. The strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this production down to the treads! The only good thing about this show is its graphics, which seem to improve a bit with each season. OK, I take that back. Who uses CG that inexpertly? The designers of this show.Do not bother with it, it will offend your Star Trek sense, as it did mine. Not even the throw backs to previous shows can save this catastrophe.I wept openly when i watched this, probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost ruptured. That bad.","label":0},{"index":5378,"txt":"First off, let me say that I am a great believer in Fanpro stuff. I see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been cancelled. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are examples of decent efforts. So I have a softspot for fanpro stuff that means I will overlook things that I would ordinarily slate badly.So on to ST HF. Well, first off the good things. Enthusiasm is a major part of making any show believable and, for the most part, the crew of the various ships all seem to be having a good time with their roles. Next, the effects are not bad for a homebrew effort, with nothing to make you really wince. The stories are not too bad either. Nothing particularly innovative, but solid enough stuff and at least there are ongoing storyarcs.But it has a lot of faults.First off, although they quite obviously HAVE to ripoff Star Trek footage, set backdrops, music and effects, I see no reason why they proceeded to rip off virtually every other scifi musical score ever made. Everything from Aliens to Starship Troopers rears it orchestral head at one point or another. Likewise, much of the footage is from other movies, dutifully CGI would over to make it look different. The Grey warships, for instance, though disguised, are quite obviously Star Destroyers from Star Wars. And the station is also rather obviously Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga from Starship Troopers. Likewise, sound effects from various Star Wars movies appear in space battles between fighters, as does animated over footage. In one scene in either first or second season, I think, you even see two TIE fighters fly past during a battle, which hardly does your suspension of disbelief any favours.Acting varies from the reasonable to the hideously painful to watch. Everyone does improve as the seasons progress, though, but expect to grimace at the screen a lot, especially in the early seasons. They have also made some interesting acting choices. Let us just say that the food replicators on this show seem permanently set to cake and leave it at that.Makeup effects are generally quite effective on the whole. But they really ought to mercilessly club to death the person who decided to use cheap Ferengi and Cardassian masks for anything other than background use or passing shots. They are just beyond unrealistic. Every time I saw one of these apart from trying not to laugh too much I kept expecting the unfortunate soul wearing it to pull out a gun and announce that This is a stickup! In one scene a Cardassian actually talks whilst wearing one of these. Not only do the lips not move, but the mask does not even have an opening where the mouth should be. Someone needs to be slapped hard for that. Could not they have taken a craft knife to it, for goodness sake! There are also some welldone, but unintentionally funny makeup jobs, such as the Herman Munster look alike.The writing, though coherent, is nothing new. Instead the script runs like a continuation of DS9, with the ships heading out from DS12 on various missions. The new enemy, The Grey are not very menacing and the plot line involving them is effectively a reworking of the Borg threads. i.e. Starfleet meet the Grey, the Grey are hugely powerful, Starfleet barely escape with their lives, then through technology they begin to find ways to combat the enemy etc etc. All done before with the Borg.Another bone of contention is the dialogue. Star Trek writers have long had the ability to write insert technobabble here into a script. It usually means an exposition of the latest plan to combat the enemy using quantum phase discriminators or isolytic charges etc. In other words, nonsense that tells you that they are on the case and a resolution is at hand.The words are just gibberish really. I have no problem with this, but where STHF makes a mess of it is where they include realworld comments into this concept.Tactical advice such as We need to regroup sounds good, but not when uttered by trio of characters already standing in a group. Likewise when asked what the situation is, a tactical officer is heard to reply We count three battleships. He actually needed to count them? Cmon! I expected the questioner to ask him Are you sure? or Can you double check. But my alltime favourite comment is this Captain Can we establish twoway communication?Comms officer No, we can only send and receive..Well, duh!.....Having said all the above, the show does improve as it goes along. Seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad, 3 shows an improvement but 4  5 are where it starts to get noticeably better. Season 6 so far looks quite reasonable.I do have a problem with their choice of media for the shows though. Quicktime sucks, quite frankly and the sooner they move to divxavi format the better. Some of us like to actually take our downloaded shows and watch them on decent size screen and not peer at a tiny QT window on a computer monitor. Not only does Quicktime make this difficult, but the 320x180 resolution the shows are in does not scale at all well. In fact, it makes the shows pretty unwatchable, like they were a tenthgeneration VHS tape copy. The least they could do was to include a hires downloadable option.Anyway, the show has promise, and I am even beginning to like some of the characters. But that is 40 episodes on, so I am not sure this says that much about character development at all.But what can you say, it is free....PS Out of 28 votes, 19 people rated this show as a 9 or 10.

Joseph Sarnos film has nothing to offer, except copious amounts of gratuitous nudity and even that becomes boring rather quickly.

I was left feeling surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had anything to do with this turkey, individually or collectively.The film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and I like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall. But once the twist was revealed, the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable, the underlying motive for revenge was illconceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for Bobby Earl was ridiculously farfetched. What is worse is that, once the twist was revealed, the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable.Harris gave a terrific performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman in that he never gives a bad performance, even if the movie as not that great! So all in all, it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema.","label":0},{"index":5388,"txt":"Sexo Cannibal, or Devil Hunter as it is more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences, starts with actress  model Laura Crawford Ursula Buchfellner as Ursula Fellner checking out locations for her new film along with her assistant Jane Gisela Hahn. After a long days work Laura is relaxing in the bath of her room when two very dubious characters named Chris Werner Pochath  Thomas Antonio Mayans burst in  kidnap her having been helped by the treacherous Jane. Lauras agent gets on the blower to rentahero Peter Weston Al Cliver who is informed of the situation, the kidnappers have Laura on an isolated island  are demanding a 6 million ransom. Peter is told that he will be paid 200,000 to get her back safely  a further 10 of the 6 million if he brings that back as well, faster than a rat up a drain pipe Peter  his Vietnam Vet buddy helicopter pilot Jack are on the island  deciding on how to save Laura. So, the kidnappers have Laura  Peter has the 6 million but neither want to hand them over that much. Just to complicate things further this particular isolated island is home to a primitive tribe hell, in all the generations they have lived there they have only managed to build one straw hut, now that is primitive who worship some cannibal monster dude Burt Altman with bulging eyes as a God with human sacrifices  this cannibal has a liking for young, white female flesh  intestines...This Spanish, French  German coproduction was cowritten  directed by the prolific Jesus Franco who also gets the credit for the music as well. Sexo Cannibal has gained a certain amount of notoriety here in the UK as it was placed on the Video Nasties list in the early 80s under it is alternate Devil Hunter title  therefore officially classed as obscene  banned, having said that I have no idea why as it is one bad film  even Franco, who is not afraid to be associated with a turkey, decides he wants to hide under the pseudonym of Clifford Brown. I would imagine even the most diehard Franco fan would have a hard time defending this thing. The script by Franco, erm sorry I mean Clifford Brown  Julian Esteban as Julius Valery who was obviously another one less than impressed with the finished product  wanted his named removed, is awful. It is as simple  straight forward as that. For a start the film is so boring it is untrue, the kidnap plot is one of the dullest I have ever seen without the slightest bit of tension or excitement involved  the horror side of things do not improve as we get a big black guy with stupid looking oversized bloodshot eyes plus two tame cannibal scenes. As a horror film Sexo Cannibal fails  as an action adventure it has no more success, this is one to avoid.Director Franco shows his usual incompetence throughout, a decapitated head is achieved by an actor lying on the ground with large leaves placed around the bottom of his neck to try  give the impression it is not attached to anything! The cannibal scenes are poor, the action is lame  it has endless scenes of people randomly walking around the jungle getting from A to B  not really doing anything when they get there either. It becomes incredibly dull  tedious to watch after about 10 minutes  do not forget this thing goes on for 94 minutes in it is uncut state. I also must mention the hilarious scene when Al Cliver is supposed to be climbing a cliff, this is achieved by Franco turning his camera on it is side  having Cliver crawl along the floor! Just look at the way his coat hangs  the way he never grabs onto to anything as he just pulls himself along! The gore is not that great  as far as Euro cannibal films go this is very tame, there are some gross close ups of the cannibals mouth as it chews bits of meat, a man is impaled on spikes, there is some blood  a handful of intestines. There is a fair bit of nudity in Sexo Cannibal  an unpleasant rape scene.Sexo Cannibal must have had a low budget  I mean low. This is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effects  rock bottom production values. The only decent thing about it is the jungle setting which at least looks authentic. The music sucks  sound effects become annoying as there is lots of heavy breathing whenever the cannibal is on screen. The acting sucks, the whole thing was obviously dubbed anyway but no one in this thing can act.Sexo Cannibal is a terrible film that commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell. The only good things I can say is that it has a certain sleazy atmosphere to it  those close ups of the cannibal chewing meat are pretty gross. Anyone looking for a decent cinematic experience should give Sexo Cannibal as wide a berth as possible, one to avoid.","label":0},{"index":5389,"txt":"A question for all you girls out there  If a man youve never met before accidentally phoned you up on purpose and continued to do so at the most indiscreet moments would you be intrigued by him or so freaked out youd phone the police ?

It is not as scary as Night of the Demons, it is not as gory as ReAnimator and lacks the camp value of There is Nothing Out There. That being said, this film has no value. Keep in mind, the movie artwork is for a completely different film. The stills shots on the back of the DVD box are not taken from this film.VIOLENCE  There is plenty of violence but we have seen it all before. A murderer kills nubile students and the occasional facility member by slitting throats and all the other tired methods of murder that horror films utilize.NUDITY None STORY  The story focuses on Francine Forbes  who wisely changed her name to Forbes Riley after this film was made  who accepts a job teaching at a university. People start to die and Forbes believes the killer is targeting her. Is it her new heartthrob with a checkered past or the libidocrazed student? To be honest, it is impossible to care because the script does not flesh out any character outside Forbes.ACTING  Terrible on all levels.

I would like to think that viewing the results here is what convinced them to give up all pretension and go for selfconscious parody.Splatter University is another film for the masochists in the audience. As it meanders about through two separate casts and innumerable pointless subplots, it actually becomes painful to watch. Let us see if I can summarize.After learning that a dangerous psychopath has escaped from a local hospital, the action moves to a Catholic university I do not recall the name, but in honor of the title, let us call it St. Splatter. The students are listless and sullen, and argue pettily with each other, slackers ahead of their time. Meanwhile, the new professor, Julie Parker, proves utterly incompetent at her job. The kids deal with relationships, infidelity, unwanted pregnancies, lecherous priests, and how to avoid doing any work in class; Julie deals with a creepy boyfriend, the inflexible administration at St. Splatter, counseling unwed mothers, and the blank, expressionless looks of her students. None of it means a darn thing or gets resolved in any meaningful way. Oh, and every once in a while, a POV shot comes along and stabs one of the girls to death, but do not hold your breath waiting for it. There is a Red Herring Killer, and then a sadly anticlimactic confrontation with the Real Killer, then it is back to the asylum and roll credits.The slow pace and numerous inane subplots seem almost calculated to produce a mounting sense of frustration in the viewer, which is helped along by choppy editing, coffeecan sound quality, and dialog that just does not make any sense. And the most agonizing thing about this movie is the killers fixation on women  the men in this movie are just so deserving. I wouldve paid good money to see someone off the jerk with the pregnant girlfriend, or the lunkhead Lothario who was fooling around with his girlfriends roommate, or any of the creepy priests.

Even backwoods cabins and campsites have rode shotgun to the amount of massacres that have taken place on campuses since Halloween categorised the genre as a cult horror category. From early entries like To all a Good Night right up until the big budgeted schlock of titles like Urban Legend or Schools Out, there is usually always been a campus slasher lurking somewhere in the pipeline. Despite being picked up by Troma  the titans of B movie badness \u0096 Splatter University was heavily panned upon release and never really found an audience. Even notorious hack and slash websites like HYSTERIALIVES have written off Richard Haines splatter yarn as one of the worst of the early eighties boom. I always approach criticised movies optimistically because there is often the chance than a few bad reviews can be unfairly contagious like a dose of the flu, which crowds the judgement of certain authors.It begins in traditional fashion at the place where any maniac worth his salts emerges. Yep you guessed it \u0096 an insane asylum! It seems that one of the inmates has decided that he is unhappy with the level of service at the institution and therefore he is looking to take his business elsewhere. The unseen nutjob makes his break after stabbing an unfortunate orderly where the sun certainly does not shine. He obviously favours the dress sense of the murdered worker, so he takes the liberty of borrowing his uniform, blood stained trousers and all!Three years later, we transfer to St Trinians College, an educational establishment that is controlled by catholic priests. A teacher is busy after hours marking her students work when all of a sudden there is a knock at the door. Before she has a chance to find out what the unseen visitor wants, he stabs her in the chest with a kitchen knife and she falls to the floor in a bloody heap. This of course means that there is a vacancy at the university and so we are introduced to Julie Parker Francine Forbes, the lovable replacement for the recently departed lecturer. It seems that her arrival has inadvertently given the resident maniac all the motivation that he needs to go on a no holds barred slaughterthon. Before long students and teachers alike are dropping like flies to the camera shy menace as he stalks the corridors and local areas armed with an exceptionally large blade. Suspicious suspects abound, but can professor Parker solve the mystery of the campus murderer before she becomes just another statistic? I am not precisely sure how many versions of this movie are available. The UK altered video was released under the alias of Campus Killings, but the US copy that I own states that it is the complete unedited edition, which could mean that there is a censored print floating about somewhere? I would be fairly surprised if that was the case as Splatter University certainly is not as goredelicious as the hyperbole packaging would lead you to believe. One or two litres of corn syrup certainly do not stand up to gore hounds scrutiny when compared to the likes of Blood Rage or Pieces, so in this instance the movie is somewhat over hyped. One thing that many critics have failed to mention is the charming lead performance from Francine Forbes, who ends up carrying the entire picture on her shoulders throughout the 79minute running time. Despite amateurish direction from Richard Haines she still unveils some magnificent potential that should have lead to the chance of another stab at serious acting under a more accomplished helmer. Unfortunately that possibility never came, and bottom of the barrel bombs like Death Ring and Splitz certainly did not help to nurture a talent that could have improved dramatically under the right scholarship.The rest of the cast members were par for the course of movie obscurity, especially the wooden plank teenagers who for some strange reason acted like they were auditioning for a remake of Grease or The Wanderers. The bog standard point and shoot direction could not have helped to build much confidence in the project and the fact that the few signs of potential were undermined by the clumsy handling of the script writer left the feature effectively unredeemable. Perhaps the only claim of originality to be found in Haines slasher is the brave attempt for the contrasting conclusion. Let us just say that it is not a final that I was expecting to witness in a movie that was so typical of the cycle.At one point in the runtime, one of the teens says, Man that Parker bores me to tears\u0085 Well the same can be said for Splatter University, which never lifts the pace above slow motion. With that said though, Francine Forbes made for a delectable scream queen and undoubtedly one that I would have paid to watch again in a similar role.

Yanos wants to bring Igors charred corpse back to life.But of course Igor is still alive although horribly burned and stalking and killing the women in the village. We see his charbroiled face appear at various points in the film, so we know he is still alive, making the whole thing seem a little bit too obvious.Igor meets another fiery end when he gets into a fight with Yanos over Ivanna, with the burning candles falling on to the same bed that Igor stumbles on to, meeting yet another, final charbroiled end.The Retromedia DVD is taken from a VHS source and looks quite grainy and bad. Other than an even scratchier trailer, no other extras are included. Although it has a nice, creepy Spanish castle and good atmospherics, I found it to be fairly boring and predictable, with no excitement or mystery, whatsoever. 3 out of 10.","label":0},{"index":5415,"txt":"I purchased the BLOOD CASTLE DVD on eBay for a few bucks not knowing what it was and all I can say is that I was not disappointed with this purchase. BLOOD CASTLE is one of those trashy European horror films that has almost no redeeming quality except for being thoroughly entertaining, for all the bad reasons. The opening alone was worth the price of the DVD our heroine, Dr. Ivanna, arrives at the castle where she is supposed to help a scientist, Baron Dalmar, who does experiments on dead tissue. On her way to the castle 1 a man tries to rape Ivanna. 2 the castles housekeeper fights with her. 3 the maid wants her dead. 4 and finally, Baron Dalmar nearly spits on her and wants her out the next day. Hmm...something tells me she is not welcome. With such a miserable arrival, you would think Ivanna would leave the place in a NY minute but no, like so many great trashy films, our headstrong heroine decides to stay put and even enjoys a candlelight dinner with the grumpy Baron on that same eventful day. The intro is so overthetop trashy it is even greater than the memorable first few minutes of that Canadian film, JUNIOR that I knew I was going to enjoy this.But the fun does not end there. Ivanna is repeatedly drugged whenever she goes to bed at night, only to wake up from unconsciousness, naked, bound and tortured in mild sessions of SM by an unseen man. Even after experiencing these nightly SM sessions, Ivanna stays at the castle, dully convinced by the angry Baron that what she is experiencing are nothing more than dreams. To be expected, even after being treated so badly from the getgo, Ivanna, falls in love with the Baron. Ivanna completely disregards anything negative about him, including the obvious fact that the dour Baron is popular with the young ladies. Every women at the castle it seems only women work there is in love with the miserable chump, who does not mind taking advantage of the pretty young things. Things get even sillier as someone lurks around the estate and kills and has been killing women. Basically, the Barons physically disfigured brother, Igor is responsible for everything. In a very long winded scene, the brother warns the Baron he should not get too involved with Ivanna or he will suffer the consequences. So what do the Baron and Ivanna do about this? Well, they get married of course! During the very brief marriage ceremony, the Baron is shot by one of the angry locals father of one of the dead girls. But all of this does not deter Ivanna, who, amidst all the dead young ladies and torture surrounding them, cheerfully comforts the hurt Baron that it is just a flesh wound and the two can go on and enjoy their honeymoon at the castle, where the killerrapisttorturer brother is. The whole thing quickly devolves into a nightmarish love triangle of sorts, between Ivana, the Baron and Igor. Blame it all on love!Anyway, you get the idea subtle it is not. Almost everything is overthetop ridiculous in this film and when it is not OTT, such as the predictable climax, things get a tad boring. But for most of the film, the director or writer revel in one illogically trashy moment after another. I really love these kind of films, everything as subtle as being hit over the head with a sledgehammer, and populated by characters behaving illogically. Even those who made the Retromedia DVD realize this and when you go to the scene selection section, we hear one of the funniest bits of dialogue from the dubbed movie looped endlessly. The production values are beautifully risible. The opening and closing credits, with those candles and red curtains...ah, a soup\u00e7on of class. The music sounds sometimes like something from a Tim Burton film, which only adds to the oddness of it all. And customary to these kind of films, when the young ladies take off their clothes, they just beg to be killed.As a standard film, I rate this a 2, but as a it is so bad it is good film, I rate it a solid 8 stars. If you enjoy trashy films, please watch this one. It is a must see. The only thing left for me to ponder about it what would it have taken for that woman to get out of that freaking castle?","label":0},{"index":5416,"txt":"This is a film that belongs firmly to the 50s.

First of all, I do not think Leslie Caron was really fit to play such a role. She is not that talented, she is not a great dancer and she is not good looking at all. It is a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if Leslie Caron had not been in this, it might have made a terrific movie. The story was intelligent, the directing was not bad, and, as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I am not saying all this stuff about Leslie Caron just to criticize her, I am just saying it because I think that is what the worse part of the movie is.

Not Georges Guetary, who is sometimes criticized for being too young and unFrench. Not Leslie Caron, who is sometimes criticized for her very green performance. Not even Oscar Levant, who more often than not annoys the dickens out of me.No, it would definitely be Gene Kelly. There is something about his screen persona that is too ambitious and focused for him to be convincing as a penniless artist in Paris, content to put off facing the critics indefinitely, frolicking with little kids and old ladies and painting in the streets. That is what made him so effective in SINGIN IN THE RAIN and other movies where he played ambitious, focused characters. Jerry Mulligan is in some ways a cousin to Tommy Albright in BRIGADOON, another Lerner story with Kelly miscast as an American at loose ends who falls in love with a picturesque European place and an innocent female who embodies its virtues.Except that Jerry is not as likeable as even poor dazed Tommy. That is another galling thing about this film. Jerry is sometimes a cad to Milo, and even worse to Lise. When he first sees the latter at a club, he pulls a dirty trick to get her to dance with him. When she sits down again he pulls an even dirtier trick to get her phone number. When he calls her the next day she hangs up on him, which he takes as a cue to drop in at her workplace. And throughout all this it is obvious she wants NOTHING to do with him. When she starts laughing at his jokes in the perfume shop, it is about as believable as Milos interest in his paintings. Sure he is goodlooking and playful, but why should that sway her when she is got Henri, who seems like a gentleman to boot?Admittedly it comes off so distasteful partly because of the actress. If a role like Lise was played by, say, Judy Garland, she would shower Jerry with indignant insults and glares. If she was played by Cyd Charisse, one would admire his guts. But when she is played by firsttimer Leslie Caron she looks and acts like a shy, vulnerable teenager, and as a result Jerry just seems like a creep. And why DID they choose these other actors though personally I would rather they would solved things by changing the lead when the whole story hinges on the romance of these two young poor sweethearts disentangling themselves from their loveless commitments to older rich people? Not only is Gene Kelly a few years above Guetary and Foch, he is old enough to be Carons father.In short I think it all would have been improved by casting some young comedicrelief type dancer as Jerry, the kind that usually turned up in musical supporting roles...e.g. Ray MacDonald in GOOD NEWS or Bobby Van in SMALL TOWN GIRL. Maybe not them necessarily but someone LIKE them. Someone who could have chased Lise and made it seem harmlessly playful; someone who would have appeared genuinely happy living in that Chaplinesque holeinthewall; someone whose humor and naivete would have contrasted better with Oscar Levants sarcastic grumpiness. It probably also would have made the ballet seem less ponderous. And it might have provided a voice that could sing Gershwin better.All this may give the impression that I do not like Gene Kelly. I do like him. He was terrific in most of his films, just not this one well, and a few others. I do not despise AAIP itself, either; it has good points, like the art direction. And Leslie Caron, who despite her inexperience is rather charming, and really does look like she just stepped out of a painting. Georges Guetary does a fine job and his Stairway to Paradise is my favorite number in the movie. Nina Foch is beautiful and touching and should have ended up with SOMEBODY. But not Jerry Mulligan.

Either as a representation of Wagners swansong, or as a movie, this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster, with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy, lugubrious realisation of the text.It is questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera or, for that matter, a play, especially one by Shakespeare is about should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio; Syberberg, very fashionably, but without the smallest justification from Wagners text, decided that Parsifal is about bisexual integration, so that the title character, in the latter stages, transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe, though one who continues to sing high tenor  few if any of the actors in the film are the singers, and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan, the conductor, who is seen as the face but not heard as the voice of Amfortas, and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or Conductor Who Ate Monsalvat during the playing of the Good Friday music  in which, by the way, the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in illlaid turf, an expedient which baffles me. In the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts, but I cannot think why Syberberg could not splice in, for Parsifal and Gurnemanz, mountain pasture as lush as was provided for Julie Andrews in Sound of Music...The sound is hard to endure, the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual. Someone in another review mentioned the 1951 Bayreuth recording, and Knappertsbusch, though his tempi are often very slow, had what Jordan altogether lacks, a sense of pulse, a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music  and, after half a century, the orchestral sound in that set, in modern pressings, is still superior to this film.","label":0},{"index":5423,"txt":"Admittedly, Parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone, although it is a favourite of mine, Knappertsbusch, 1951, in particular. Syberbergs entire approach is so static. Whenever the music suddenly begins to swell ... Syberberg keeps the cast moving at the same pace. The takes on Amfortas and Klingsor are endless. Whatever happened to film editing? The result is physically exhausting to watch. The viewer is never spiritually transported. Your impulse is to rush home and play a recording again to confirm that Wagner got it right, Syberberg got it wrong. And that set decoration with those clever reminders of Wagners antiSemitism  will there ever be a viewer of this film with no prior knowledge of Wagner?","label":0},{"index":5424,"txt":"N.B. Spoilers within. Assigning an artistic director to an operatic production naturally and inevitably means you are going to get a piece of that directors mind. But directing a Wagner opera is an especially tricky task, as he was perhaps the most explicit opera composer in terms of what things should look like and how they should unfold. HansJurgen Syberberg loads this filming of Parsifal, Wagners final masterpiece, with enough extraneous ideas to cause it to nearly burst at the seams. You get more than a piece of the director you get the whole fatted hog and then some. Syberberg is to be admired for his penchant for tearing back the covers on the uglier aspects of German history. But does it work to meld that desire to a Wagner opera already brimming with its own concepts? The scenes with the knights of the Holy Grail in Acts I and III are especially laden with visual allegory and symbolism. These are drawn come from Wagners own time, from long before, and go well beyond. If you know what these things mean, they can enrich Syberbergs vision for you but not necessarily enhance Wagners vision; if you do not know what they mean, they are simply confusing, if not annoying. I will not bother uncoiling the plot of the opera here. Suffice it to say it is a typical Wagnerian synthesis of diverse elements, in this case a blending of the Holy Grail legend with the principles, practices, and pageantry of Christianity. The theme of redemption plays the main role here, as in nearly every Wagner opera.I personally had to sweat to get through Syberbergs first act amidst my jarring acclimation, the music saved the day. But Act II picks up the pace. Here we meet Klingsor, the evil sorcerer, out to entrap the wandering innocent fool Parsifal. The greatest seductress of them all, Kundry, will be used to entice him to the dark side. After an initial dalliance with more symbols, these get stripped away, and the long, gorgeous, transformational duet between young fool and temptress really takes off. Finally the film starts working a genuine magic, and it is chiefly due to Syberbergs choosing to set things naturally and simply. Suddenly the acting starts to work the expressive actress Edith Clever and the luscious soprano of Yvonne Minton team to create a wondrous Kundry; suddenly the music seems to come to life and make vivid the inner turmoil of the two characters. The camera work stays simple and quietly fluid. In other words, Wagner is allowed to tell his story more on his own terms. And it works beautifully. For me it was the most engrossing part of the film.With the reentrance of the knights in part 2 of Act III, the weird extraneous symbolisms unfortunately creep back in. Some other loony Syberberg ideas using a huge Wagner deathmask as a major setpiece causing the composers protuberant proboscis to loom comically large; dressing the Act III knights in all manner of costumes, wigs, and makeup what is the director saying? That the knights are a bunch of buffoons? That they express multiple or timeless layers of significance beyond their surface functions? It is anybodys guess; the insertion \u0096 just after the incredibly touching baptism of Kundry by Parsifal \u0096 of rearprojection footage of the conductor rehearsing, in modernday realism, his orchestra in the studio this completely snapped my dramatic thread, requiring a few minutes to regroup; the complete avoidance of having any time pass between Acts II and III when we meet the knight and narrator Gurnemanz again, he should be an old, old man, and Parsifal should reemerge as a worldweary but wiser middleaged man; but certainly the most bizarre stroke is to split the Parsifal character into malefemale components. Some find this the most brilliant stroke. No doubt I can credit Karin Krick, who plays Parsifal 2, with acting of strength and dignity she also happens to be the best lipsyncher of the whole cast. But please...Wagners conception of Parsifal is already so complex. His growth from a completely innocent boy who knows nothing of his past, to his breakthrough realization in Act II of what Amfortass eternal wound means and how it has become his own, to his return as the great Redeemer of Act III \u0096 this is the journey of a masterfully constructed character. The bisexual emphasis is just gimmicky and absurd. And what is with this nonsense about a homoerotic Gurnemanz and Parsifal?? Cannot we just accept a mentorapprentice relationship, which is marvelously reversed in Act III? The Monte Carlo Philharmonic under Armin Jordan plays with passion and beauty though the chorus is disappointing. But after watching this film I only wanted to whip out my Soltiled recording HIGHLY recommended and get my Wagnerian bearings straight again. The film experience for me ranged from bizarre to entertaining to infuriating. To Syberbergs credit, he is created a visually arresting work, and he certainly offers a unique take on an important opera. But instead of sticking to Parsifal, he seems to have wanted to bring in all things Wagnerian the man, the life, the enormous influence...all of it in crude symbolic code. Parsifal the opera is already full of weighty symbolism the Grail, the Spear, the Holy Sacraments, baptism, Amfortass everbleeding wound, Klingsors selfcastration, the Kiss, Kundrys Curse, and on and on. This is not to mention the musical symbolism sounding constantly in the score, in the form of Wagners leitmotif system. Parsifal itself is one huge symbol! Getting back to my firstparagraph question, Syberbergs whole hog is all way too much for me. But if this project sounds like something to tickle your fancy, then go for it. I will not recommend just staying away from this; you may find yourself heartily satisfied. Or if you need something to crack your Wagner barrier, try it...but please, please, do not stop here. Parsifal is in a late, very ripe league of its own.","label":0},{"index":5425,"txt":"Of the ten actors who portrayed Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe seemed the most personable, but in this script the audience is way ahead of the famed detective.

But this is only the start of the battle between the brothers, and their final battle is about to start now, a millennia later...Comments I had hopes that this would be a movie based upon some Viking ground, far too little quality movie about Viking has been done. It started out very good too, with detailed longships and armors, nice and fitting sceneries and an OK battle.The foundation in the Aesir myths is thin and seems very corrupted to me. Odin is much more vengeful, spiteful and absent than I remind him from school, and the valkyries has been turned into some vampiredemons. I am no expert, but that seems outright wrong.But the fatal mistake made by this movie is to move the timesetting from the original timeperiod to today. If the two brothers had fought it out in the correct time, with some decent battles, this movie would have been much better. Now the setting, suddenly is changed to present day Stockholm. Still, Odin is present and is sending Boar and his berserkers for Brunhilda and Barek which gives silly scenes when armorclad and painted berserkers swordfights with Barek among the industries. Beautiful mountains and woods have been exchanged for cement. And when allowed to focus upon single fights, instead of massive battles as in the beginning, I quickly saw that the fights and skills of the actors are slow and clumsy.The end result is thin story, sometimes hard to follow and other times just silly, and the only that could save it, the action, is drawn from slow, dull and clumsy swordfights. It draws very little from Aesir myth or Viking tradition. Thus both story and action fails, and the movie is just plain bad.Finally, as a Swede, this movie is a little confusing. Supposedly filmed entirely in South Africa, it still contains some familiar Swedish signs, plates and what seems to be an authentic police car. However, the effort is poor and only goes so far, as to really set it in Sweden. No names are Swedish perhaps with Anya as the exception, no familiar sceneries are Swedish, they supposedly speak a little ancient? Norwegian, not Swedish.

The movie fails, not necessarily because I really do think these kids were influenced by video games, but because the movie sets it up as random and does not follow through. Let me clarify. In Aileen Life and Death of a Serial Killer, you can see her claims about the police and being controlled by radio waves are ridiculous, yet she is so troubled, she really believes them to be true. The viewer can make the distinction however. In Zero Day, the 2 kids keep saying how they are not influenced by anything environmental, which is obviously false since everything they do contradicts this. Neonazism, talking about going on CNN with Wolf Blitzer which is laughable not only because they know his name, but its a shameless attempt by the filmmaker to get coverage of his bad movie..etc. This movie does not depict reality, it shows nothing but phoniness to prove a point. Unfortunately you fell for the bait and did not see this, and you did not pick up on it from my review either. The entire movie is just taking Michael Moores hypothesis and applying it to something real life in hopes of validating and it fails, not necessarily because the hypothesis is wrong, but because the movie is wrong and does not support it. Of course I do not think kids that play video games are more likely to kill people, but if I am not mistaken, did not video tape exist of the Columbine kids or some teen killers shooting guns in the forest claiming how much they looked or acted like the weaponry in Doom? Hmmmmmmm, the distinction is kids are most likely aware of the media, influenced, but obviously balanced or intelligent enough that its not even an issue. Zero Day is a bad movie not because I really believe a correlation exists, but because the film maker does not know what hes trying to say, and the movie does more to disprove his point then support it. It is almost as if the new ratings given to video games made someone upset so they came up with Zero Day in retaliation. If you want to see the mindless teen killer theory pulled off right, go watch Bully.","label":0},{"index":5437,"txt":"This film is pretty poor. The acting is abysmal and completely forced.

Although the screenplay packs in enough variations on werewolfFrankensteinDr Moreau themes to flesh out a dozen movies, the plot is so unevenly developed, the characterizations so feeble and the dialogue so verbosely ridiculous at least in the English version, that any latent interest in the turgid proceedings is soon quashed.Zabalzas direction seems jerky, even amateurish.

In short, the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It is utter nonsense, and incomprehensible nonsense at that.Waldemar Daninsky, that venerable lycanthropic antihero portrayed by Paul Naschy in a seemingly endless series of films, is apparently a normal guy who has just come back from a trip to Tibet, where he was attacked by a yeti. Somehow this has turned him into a werewolf. Daninsky is a doctor, a scientist, and an instructor at what appears to be a college. One of his female colleagues, Ilona Elmann, is involved in a vague form of hypnosis...Chematodes, a nonsense word used to refer to a bunch of wires attached to a victims head. Ellman feels this will enable her to change the direction of the human brain, naturally enabling her to rule the world, provided she can get us all attached to those wires with no trouble.Elmann is also into werewolves, because she kidnaps Daninsky and takes him to her hidden laboratory. She has a bunch of other people trapped there as well. Some of them look like gypsies, and are chained up, being in varying states of lucidity. Others are clearly hippies. Elmann feels that one day she may be able to help them be human again ?, but in the meantime she controls them with her chematodes. Waldemar becomes her hairy hit man, wandering around like a werewolf zombiethat is until the filmmakers decide to use footage spliced in from another Naschy werewolf film, Frankensteins Bloody Terror do not ask, at which point Naschys werewolf makeup changes considerably and he lurches around like an animal.Is this making any sense? No? Good. That is the films saving grace. It does not try and engage you on any kind of intellectual level, it just goes full speed ahead with whatever nonsense dialogue or cheap horror movie sets it can muster up.

So if you are one of those reckless individuals, stop reading at once and go and watch it for yourself. If you get drunk enough in advance, you might be fortunate enough to pass out before it is over.Begin with the premise that a man may become a werewolf after being bitten by a yeti. No one in the film ventures an explanation as to how this sort of crossspecies implantation could occur, and the rest of the movie is even more hopelessly nonsensical. But pour yourself another glass of wine or whatever you are drinking, and let us proceed.Paul Naschy our werewolf has the look of a man fighting a toothache, in a town where the only dentist has traded his supply of Novocaine for a case of cheap whiskey, and has been drunk ever since. As not he the lucky one? Naschys facial expression never varies, whether in or out of makeup, and apparently no one gave him any coaching on how to act like a werewolf. Occasionally he tries to imitate the Lon Chaney Jr. crouch, but most of the time he simply strolls around in his black mafia shirt, like just another cool dude with a tad too much facial hair. To be fair, the makeup is actually better than the actor inside of it, but the continuity is infinitely worse. Naschys werewolf is the only one I can think of that changes shirts twice in the middle of a prowl. He goes from black shirt to red shirt, then back to black, then back to red, then back to black, all in a single, frenzied night. Interestingly enough, he always does the Chaney crouch while wearing the red shirt, and the cool dude walk while wearing the black shirt. And it is only while he is wearing the red shirt that we see much of the fury alluded to in the title. Presumably there is something about that red shirt that just brings out the animal in him.So anyway, after being bitten by the crosspollinating yeti, the poor schmuck returns home from Tibet to learn that his wife has been sleeping with one of his students. The two illicit lovers try to murder him by adjusting the brakes on his car. He survives the wreck, and makes it home just in time for a full moon. Then, after chewing up his wife and her lover, he wanders off again, and somehow manages to get himself electrocuted. But is that enough? Can they let this tormented wretch rest in peace? Not a chance. He is resurrected by a supposed female scientist with a hardcore SM fetish, otherwise known as The Doctor and definitely not a new incarnation of Doctor Who. She digs him up and whisks him away to her kinky kastle, takes him down to the dungeon, chains him to the wall, and gives him a damn good flogging. Presumably such a string of indignities ought to be enough to put a little fury into any wolfman.After his twoshirted rampage, our wolfman spends most of the rest of the film wandering around the castle, trying to find a way out. And who can blame him? In the course of his wanderings, he encounters a bewilderingly incoherent assortment of clich\u00e9s, including a man dressed in medieval armor, a curiously inept Phantom of the Opera impersonator supposedly The Doctors father, and a hardpartying cadre of bondage slaves.So what is it all about, one may reasonably ask? One gets the vague impression that it has something to do with mind control, and involves something The Doctor calls chemotrodes. Best guess. I really have no idea how it is spelled, if there even is such a thing. Mercifully, the experiment ends in failure, and most importantly, it ends...before one has time to gnaw ones own leg off.Of course, one does not really expect any sense from a film like this, but at least it ought to be good for laughs. This one is not. Forget it, buddy. There is a creeping sort of anarchy about this film, from its patchedtogether, tequiladrenched ambiance to its atrocious cinematography and agonizing musical score, that defies even the most sozzled attempts to get any MST3K type laughs out of it. If it is not even good for that, what the hell is it good for?

Some have commented that this movie is supposed to take place before the events of Werewolf Shadow, although it was released afterwards ... they may be right, I am not sure. Anyway, in this movie Waldemar Daninsky is bitten by a yetilike creature in Tibet great dialogue here  It was a yeti. But that is impossible. I am a scientist and these things do not exist. It was a hallucination. That is all. and although marked with the sign of the pentagram, he is able to prevent the change into a werewolf until he discovers that his wife has been cheating on him. Changing into the beast one night, he kills both her and her lover before running out into a storm and being electrocuted. It is not long before he is resurrected by a dominatrix university professor who is conducting some kind of unfathomable experiments with mind control. He is taken to the underground cellar of a castle where the subjects of these experiments live like chained animals.First of all  Jacinto Molina, Paul Naschy, whatever you want to call him, he is a fine actor and cared passionately about his work. No matter how flawed these movies are, you can always rely on him for a decent performance. The rest of the cast seem good enough, but it is hard to tell when they have a halfassed voiceover dubbed over all their lines. And that was really the main problem for me ... many of the voiceover artists they used were just awful, awful, awful. Whenever I chuckled during the movie it was at the inept way that they delivered their lines they seem to constantly refer to the hero as Waldeman. But unfortunately it is almost impossible to find subtitled copies of Naschy movies, although they are sometimes available in the original language without subtitles.The directing of Jose Maria Zabalza seems sort of hitandmiss ... there are some great visual ideas in some scenes, while others are badly constructed and poorly edited, particularly in the final scenes when it really counts. The reason for this, was that Zabalza was apparently drunk most of the time while on set. He allowed his fourteen year old nephew to rewrite Molinas dialogue, used extras without his permission, and spliced several shots from Molinas earlier movies. All of this pretty much ruined any chance this movie had of being one of Molinas best works, and it is no surprise that the two of them never worked together again.But it is not all bad news, as there are some good ideas here. Some aspects of the storyline make an interesting psychological drama with the werewolf as a metaphor for jealousy and rage. The werewolf as a yeti idea is one that returned in Molinas later work. Some pretty horrific and surreal stuff goes on down in the cellar, and there is also a very memorable sequence about half way through the film where Daninsky runs from house to house through a village, slaughtering or molesting innocents as he goes  one scene is particularly intense, but it is actually lifted straight from Molinas first movie, La Marca del Hombrelobo along with a few other shots. I actually found the movie on the whole to be very entertaining, although there are some problems with the Front Row Entertainment version, such as pretty obvious cuts although some of it may simply be due to the directors lack of continuity. Gods knows what omissions there are  I will probably try to get my hands on the uncut version at some stage in the future.This is a overall a decent piece of vintage Naschy which experienced fans might enjoy, but it could have been much better and so probably would not make a great introduction.","label":0},{"index":5458,"txt":"Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy stars in this, one of his weakest werewolf films... but bear with me for a moment. Most people will be familiar with it under its most common television title, THE FURY OF THE WOLF MAN, and there have been many home video versions of it over the years. If you want to be serious about giving it a fair shot though, the most workable edition I have seen of it goes by the title THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS, and it is an unedited and complete European version which restores a couple of disturbing scenes and contains the original nude shots which are missing from FURYs print. It is also letterboxed.Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky, returning home from a trip to Tibet only to find out that he is contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife has been having an affair. He takes care of her and her lover while in animal form, but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy woman doctor and her female assistant. Apparently, the doc attempts to tame the werewolf, and there is a very strange sadomasochistic love scene between her and the hairy and fanged Daninsky who is under her trance, at least in the original version. Ultimately we get two werewolves for the price of one as Daninsky battles a shewolf! The biggest problem with the movie is that the director according to Naschys claims was often drunk, and the results are indeed rather incoherent. When watching THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS copy, it is not quite as difficult to make out what is going on, though the editing remains atrocious in spots. Worst of all is occasional nonmatching footage of Naschys ravenous werewolf swiped straight from another previous film LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, aka FRANKENSTEINS BLOODY TERROR and mixed into this one without any sensible reason!

I suspect this is true, but you would not know this from the film itself. The plot is confusing at times, and there is really no indication that this is a sequel. If you read the plot summaries on Wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box, you will see that I am not alone in my confusion.Perhaps the films shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand the production hell it went through. While floating around for years, it was only released in 1973, due to problems involved in finding a distributor. And Naschy said in his autobiography that the director, Zabalza, was an incompetent alcoholic, and that he hated working with him. Those really are not light accusations, and I have no idea what Zabalza had to say on his own behalf.Chances are, sooner or later you will come across a lowgrade version of Fury of the Wolfman. It appears in a variety of threepacks and box sets, so you might accidentally acquire it and not even know. What really needs to happen is an American uncut version, with a decent sound and video mix, and the love scenes thrown back in. As far as I know, this does not exist. Let us honor Paul Naschys legacy and get his films to a wider audience in a level of quality he deserves.","label":0},{"index":5460,"txt":"Apparently, this is what happens when a director allows his 14year old nephew to rewrite the dialogue on the set while he indulges himself alcoholically in the meantime; as I said earlier, although I have always wanted to catch one of Paul Naschys werewolf pictures, this atrocity served as my introduction and, as awful as it most certainly is, I still intend to pursue other entries in the series, albeit very gradually.Despite some high profile disappointments like Joe Dantes THE HOWLING 1981, I love werewolf pictures in general but, to be honest, I quickly lost interest in this films plot and just stood there gazing at my TV screen counting its absurdities as it were. There were far too many to mention them here but I have to say two which struck me as particularly hilarious were the schizophrenic nature of the Werewolf persona i.e. going from a raging beast in one shot to a dazed, zombielike state in the very next one  as if he is on a casual midnight stroll in the countryside, and sporting an entirely different wardrobe to boot...and, yes, I did know the reasons for this beforehand, as well as the Phantom Of The Opera look of the Wolfstein character!

The film is very hard to follow and the plot just did not seem to make any sense. The Fury of the Wolfman was made in Spain and I think that when any film is dubbed from one language to another, it does not translate exactly as it was first meant. Maybe this is part of the problem but I doubt if it can account for all the problems with this film. The dubbing is pretty bad and the voices do not match the characters very well. The scenes are choppy, there is an array of strange and irrelevant characters that do little more than confuse the viewer even more. What I did like about this film was the look of the wolfman himself and the scenes where he attacks.

Basically, an 11 year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal. Of course, the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house, cash a check for 1,000,000 dollars, and even foil three bumbling idiots, reminiscent of the three stooges. Preston Blake is an annoying, obnoxious, boy, who decides that, when written a blank check by a complete stranger, he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can. In other words, he wanders into a bank, hands a teller a check he makes in his printer, and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash. Preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle, due to the fact that a man driving a Jaguar after Preston and his 10speed could not catch him, even when Preston jumped a row of cars.Of course, with every hokey adventure movie, there has to be hot heroine. In this case our hot heroine is a child molesting FBI agent who dates the eleven year old Preston, and promises another date when he turns 17. However, the absolute worst aspect of this film was not its casting, nor its sloppy dialog, such as The only other way I could think of skinning a cat is to stick a hose up it is butt and then pick up the fur. It was, rather, the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the FBI does not give a damn about random people . What I have failed to explain is that Preston uses the alias Macintosh to masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts. Of course, the FBI finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after Preston, who uses his 11year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face, then treat her to hamburgers, finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettisons from the ground. Our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the FBI is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two, as they make their way to Prestons limousine, complete with a 1dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap, 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on.Overall 110 is incredibly gracious for this film.

I always presumed the deliciously inept Empire of the Ants stood as his last masterful accomplishment in the horror genre, but that was before my dirty little hands stumbled upon an ancient and dusty VHS copy of The Coming, a totally obscure and unheard of witcherymovie that actually turned out a more or less pleasant surprise! What starts out as a seemingly atmospheric tale of late Dark Ages soon takes a silly turn when a villager of year 1692 inexplicably becomes transferred to present day Salum, Massachusetts and promptly attacks a girl in the history museum. For you see, this particular girl is the reincarnation of Ann Putman who was a bona fide evil girl in 1692 and falsely accused over twenty people of practicing witchcraft which led to their executions at the state. The man who attacked Loreen lost his wife and daughter this and wants his overdue revenge. But poor and three centuries older Loreen is just an innocent schoolgirl, \u0085 or is she? Burned at the Stake unfolds like a mixture between The Exorcist and Witchfinder General with a tad bit of The Time Machine thrown in for good measure. Way to go, Bert! The plot becomes sillier and more senseless with every new twist but at least it never transcends into complete boredom, like too often the case in other contemporary witchcraft movies like The Dunwich Horror and The Devonsville Terror. The film jumps back and forth between the events in present day and flashbacks of 1692; which keeps it rather amusing and fastpaced. The Ann Putman girl is quite a fascinating character, reminiscent of the Abigail Williams character in the more commonly known stage play The Crucible also depicted by Winona Ryder in the 1996 motion picture. There are a couple of cool death sequences, like the teacher in the graveyard or the journalist in the library, that are committed by the ghost of malignant reverend who made a pact with Ann Putman and perhaps even the Devil himself. The film gets pretty spastic and completely absurd near the end, but overall there is some good cheesy fun to be had. Plus, the least you can say about Bert I.

I went to the kitchen where I have a view of several neighborhoods in the southern Jerusalem and saw a pillar of smoke rising from a distant point, the sight of the smoke was followed a minute later by the waling of sirens. I remember rushing to my bedroom, taking out my binoculars, racing back to the kitchen and spotting the image of a glass shattered bus. The bus was still near the pick up station where a terrorist boarded on it and with a single click on a TNT device, murdered 25 passengers, many of whom were on their way to school. The wife of a good friend of mine, sat on the bus at the back row, a seemingly arbitrary and meaningless decision that saved her life.I am sure that every Israeli has at least one terrorrelated memory he wishes he never would have had and it was only a matter of time before someone made a film about it. As it turned out, the movie was about to become a repressed memory of its own.The film is about a playwrite on a dry run, Haim Buzaglo portrayed by, hmmm, Haim Buzaglo who also wrote and directed the film that spends the better part of his day conducting staring contests with his blank word processor page. In the meantime, his girlfriend, a field reporter for the Israeli commercial channel, decides to make a piece about a debt ridden exarmy officer. Buzaglo, bored and a bit paranoid due what is medically known as the what on earth this hot babe is dating me syndrome, asks a private eye to conduct a stakeout on his girlfriend.As the detective progresses in his investigation, his observations are permeating into the play and later on, to the lives of its actors. In the meantime, the play metamorphoses from a comic play into an indictment against the aloofness of the Israeli society. As for the movie, well, the movie becomes an exercise in frenzy editing, ensconced in its petty cardboard characters and unreliable dialogs while drifting miles away from the subject it was supposed to deal with in the first place.When I say cardboard characters I refer to the characters that under the writerdirectors obsession for a meaningful film, were devoid of any genuine dialogs and any shred of reliability. I will not elaborate too much about it. Suffice to say that I am sure that homeless barefoot male prostitutes rarely go the theater. With the intention to see a play, that is.This movie, according to Haim Buzaglo himself is the first part of a current agenda trilogy.

On the other hand, Cillian Murphy overacts so badly that he becomes cartoonish. The rest of the movie is riddled with plot holes, on which I will elaborate.Please do not read further if you do not want to know what happens!Here is a synopsis of the plot. Rachel McAdamss character Lisa manages a hotel where the new hardnosed Homeland Security Director plans to stay that night. Rachel is returning to Miami from a funeral, but fielding calls from her assistant up until the plane leaves. In the meantime, someone is stationed outside the house of her father, Joe played by Brian Cox, ready to kill him if Cillian Murphy Jackson calls. All Lisa has to do is phone the hotel and move the Directors suite to one where Jacksons cohorts are planning to fire a guided missile from a fishing boat to kill the Director and his family.So, here are some of the plot holes or absurd coincidences1. Jackson finally convinces Lisa to make the call, and in the middle, the phones in the plane lose their connection. Lisa tries to fake that she is making the call, but coincidentally, a guy across the aisle from Jackson is also making a call and starts banging his phone to indicate it is dead. Jackson catches on and grabs the phone from Lisa.2. At one point, Jackson headbutts Lisa and she, of course, gets knocked out...but only for 30 minutes.3. Jackson catches Lisa writing a note on the mirror in the extraordinarily large lavatory, and he bangs her around a bit. Miraculously, the only one who hears anything is an 11yearold girl, whose word, of course, is discounted.4. Lisa stabs Jackson with a pen in the throat as the plane is landing, steals his cell phone, and makes a mad dash for the exit, fitting down the aisle between the seats and 18 rows of standing passengers. Despite knowing there is a passenger with a pen stuck in his throat, the flight attendants oblige Lisa by opening the door to the jetway.5. OK, all those are reasonable if not highly unlikely. But heres where it gets really stupid. Lisa gets into the terminal at Miami Airport, and there is no cell phone signal every major airport in America has great cell phone reception.6. She runs through the airport with Jackson in hot pursuit, and no security officers even delay them.7. Jackson, who lost Lisa in the Airport while the train from the gates pulled away to the terminal, has lost some of his voice from the pen in his throat, but he can still be somewhat understood. However, he does not bother to call his man outside of Joes house. PS There is no train at Miami Airport, but the one they showed looked an awful lot like the Orlando Airport.8. Lisa steals a car and rides away. Of course this time, when she goes to make a call, the cell phone says low battery and soon shuts off when will they stop using this inane plot device?.9. While the phone still said low battery, Lisa had reached her assistant just in time to save the Director and his family from the guided missile launched by the fishing boat to the window of the room on the 40th floor to which the Director had been moved. Of course, they expect us not to notice that the hotel is surrounded on 3 sides by ocean, so the missile could have probably been launched at the first suite, thereby negating the need for the whole LisaJackson plot. What is the story here? Was the Directors original room on the 38th floor one of the only rooms in the hotel with a lousy view? Nevertheless, everyone gets out just before the missile hits.10. Lisa drives to Joes house to save her father only to see the killer outside. Although she runs him over as he is shooting at her by crashing her Jeep into the house, no one in the neighborhood seems to notice or bother to stop by.11. Jackson arrives at Joes house and knocks him out we do not see how...maybe another head butt. He then explains to Lisa that he did not kill dad yet because he wanted dad to see Lisa die first Give me a break. What is this? Saturday morning cartoons?.12. For the rest of the movie about 20 minutes, Jackson chases Lisa around the house, and she resourcefully fights him off. Of course a real killer i.e. one maybe played by Jason Statham would have done away with Lisa or for that matter anyone who is not a trained killer in the first 30 seconds. During the course of this chase, Jackson steps over Joe at least once without bothering to kill him.13. Finally, Jackson prevails, and he is about to kill Lisa when you guessed it he is shot by Joe.So, heres my suggestion...tell Wes Craven to stick to horror. Or maybe he should get together with Michael Bay who directed the equally stupid The Island and make Red Island.","label":0},{"index":5483,"txt":"I am surprised that everyone even the critics seems to think this was a good movie. It was the most clich\u00e9d thriller ever made that I have seen. We have the bad guy who wants to force the good guy or girls in this case to do something or face the consequence. The good girl in this movie must use her smarts and skills to defeat the bad guy and save the day and her loved ones. Using charisma, bravery, and even luck to save the day. Where to begin? Well, a young woman by the name of Lisa Reisert meets a young man by the name of Jackson Rippner nice name at an airport. One coincidence leads to another and soon it seems as if fate is bringing these two together. Sharing drinks, sitting next to each other, seemingly getting along in every way... Is there more to this strangeness? Could these two be meant for each other? Does fate have a reason for their strange and random encounter? Well, as it turns out, unfortunately yes. Jackson needs to Lisa to help him assassinate the Director of Homeland Security by moving him from one room to another so that his men can launch an attack on him. Oh, if she does not do this then her father is dead. Though we never learn the exact reasons why and who is really behind this madness, Jackson more then explains how this is going to happen and why its in Lisas best interest to help him.Of course, Lisa defeats his evil plans with her smarts and in the process stabs him in the neck, makes him trip over chairs, and hitting him with a field hockey stick. Oh, and before that, she leads him on wild chase through Miami airport where she gets passed post 9 11 security and steals a car that she later uses to run over the man who was ordered to kill her father. Yeah, right.First of all, I find it strange that a man like Jackson who can get his hands on high tech weaponry needs the help of a hotel manager. Could not he just sneak a bomb into the building? Would not that make it safer for him and his team by leaving out any third parties? And why do characters like Jackson also explain everything they are going to do to someone they are threatening? Does not that make it easier to stop them by the same people? The actors did their best considering the movie they were given. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still actors to look out for. Also, I believe that Jayma Mays who played the loveable Cynthia will be someone we will see more of.

The first half has Rajni uttering his usual array of oneliners and style and in the second half, becomes a quasi saint after a beggar takes him through a interdimensional portal to the Himalayas where Babaji not the famous Saints he took a dig at earlier gives him special powers for no apparent reason other than karma. This is really starting to get interesting now is not it? The rest of the movie is about him wasting his magic boons and powers and fighting off politicians and related black magic.

Limited animation as well as sub standard character and background design will limit its mass market appeal. The character design looks like a cross between the original Star Wars Clone Wars and Disneys Kim Possible, Brendan, the main character in this also bares an uncanny similarity to Ron Stoppable in Kim Possible Background design ranges as far and wide as going from being bland and depressing to stylish and stark, yet by todays standards, overall it is still poor and cheap looking. Many of the backgrounds bare resemblances to eastern European or Nordic animation from the mid 80s, nice in its own way but for modern child audiences, used to CG slug fests and talking dogs with every piece of fur on their body swaying in the wind, is sure to disappoint. The story is also not overly engaging and many of the voice actors are not overly impressive, noticeably the usually brilliant Brendan Gleeson who appears to be phoning in his part. There are also a few secondary characters who come across as slightly clich\u00e9 and stereotypically racist. However, some of the characters are good, the Viking villains, although underused are well done and are specifically foreboding in both look and sound. There is one moment involving the main character and his mentor being saved by Wolves from a Viking attack that is very nicely put together. The look and feel also seemed to be very inspired by the film Watership Down including a blatant rip offhomage to the Ghost Rabbit of Inlay. The look is also clearly and obviously inspired by GaelicCelticAnglo Saxon art so if you are into these subjects you may be drawn towards its look. The film also does have moments of very nicely structured shots leading the eye in a very artistic manner, including a pretty match cut and a large scale Viking attack that is very moody and impressive. Best of all though is the music, much of the background music is melodic and moving, specifically the song by the spirit girl which is truly beautiful and haunting and works very well with the images it covers. If the whole film was as poetic as this moment, and it tries, then this would be a very beautiful and poetic film that would sadly still not reach a wide audience, but instead it is not a shame it wont reach a wider audience because most of it is average and cheap looking and does not stand up to modern animation standards.

He plays the entire movie as a standup comedy routine. Obviously, this works fine in the scenes where he is supposed to be doing standup, but in the rest of the movie, it does not. Even when he is talking to one other character, he seems to think he is trying to make a roomful of people laugh. He has a few funny moments, but they mostly come during the standup scenes no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian. As for the rest of the cast, they are pretty much there just to give Rock someone to talk to, none of them stand out.Also, the movie was poorly directed. The movie has basically a onejoke plot old white guy acting like a young black comedian. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, this still could have worked, and been quite funny. The problem was, we saw too much of Rock and not enough of the old white guy.

Speaking of heaven, the film is based on the 1978 movie Heaven Can Wait. That was a good movie, and this is goodto demonstrate how a group of aspiring screenwriters can take decent material and turn it into garbage. Directors Chris and Paul Weitz miss nearly every target. From concept to storytelling, Down to Earth fails miserably; this is one incredibly bad production.Chris Rock is a lousy standup comedian, both in his role in this movie and in the real life. He plays Lance Barton, whose manager, Frankie Faison even feels sorry for him when he is booed off stage during amateur night at a local theatre. Soon after the script establishes his lack of talent, the character is killed by a speeding truck. Death, played by Eugene Levy, has made a mistake, taking Lance before his number was up. Gods assistant Chazz Palminteri is very angry and decides to let Lance make up the remainder of his time on Earth, as long as he takes the only available body of a 60 year old white millionaire.The old mans name is Mr. Wellington, whose life has problems of its own. His wife Jennifer Coolidge is having an affair with his assistant Greg Germann, who is robbing him of his money. But that is all right because Lance, inside Mr. Wellington, has fallen in love with a young black woman named Sontee Regina King. Meanwhile, there are plots to kill Wellington, Lance attempting to get a better body, and Sontees confused feelings dealing with a hospital situation involving Mr. Wellingtons finances.Down to Earth has some good ideas, but they are in a pointless and unconvincing love story filled with contrivances and recycled material. The biggest problem it runs into is how we perceive Lance as Mr. Wellington. Chris Rock is the actor with popularity and publicity, so he is not going to be absent from most of this movie; all of the characters see the new Lance as Mr. Wellington, but we see him as Chris Rock. This is convenient for the love story; we believe a young woman would fall for Lance, but in reality, he is actually an old, grayhaired geezer. That is not so convincing.The onejoke comic situation is supposed to be watching an old man doing funny things that are really done by a young black man. But what inspires laughter is when characters run into conflicts without their knowledge. Just look at There is Something About Mary. In the funny scenes the characters are exposed to awkward experiences, and not at their will. Here, Lance knows he is in an old mans body, and does things old men would not normally do. If Lance did not know the body he was in then that may have had potential.Another problem with the concept we never knew Mr. Wellington in the first place, so how can we compare Lance in his body when we do not know what he was like originally. To top everything off, Chris Rock needs to be the center of attention here, and makes the character too much like Rock. He recites simple standup routine jokes that are tedious and painful; his dialogue is so obvious, wooden and straightforward. I hated the films sense of humor. There are so many unfunny jokes and horrible comic situations. It is like watching Chris Rock being Chris Rock, not a character in a movie.Let us emphasize the positives in Down to Earth. Mark Addy does not do any worse here than he did in The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas. Eugene Levy and Chazz Palmentari are well cast, but they are at the mercy of a scalped script. Those are all the good qualities I can mention at this time, and if you give me another week to recollect, it is not likely that I will come up with any more.","label":0},{"index":5515,"txt":"This movie is a rewrite of the 1978 Warren Beatty movie, Heaven Can Wait, but it is written for the standup comedic style of Mr Rock.

As in Beattys movie; he chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a rich white man, all because he fancies Sontee Jenkins Regina King who happens to turn up at Wellingtons house during the murder. The role of Mrs Wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multimillionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo Sontee simply does not work. Also the intercuts used to show Rock as Wellington and then as the real white Wellington, fail miserably.

That would be too much to ask. I will grant that. But at the same time, it goes too far the other direction. I am supposed to imagine a rich white guy singing rap and completely upending things, playing like he is a bastion of hiphop culture, and people just accept him? And what about Sontee, who falls in love with him as a rich white guy, even though she does not care about his money or power?

Rewriting a movie as bland and sentimental as Heaven Can Wait only shows that Rocks eye was on the boxoffice this was strictly a corporate move organized by the most mercenary of Hollywood players. Why not strive for something loftier or more memorable than a silly reincarnation comedy that culminates with an Evening at the Apollo?

As directed by brothers Chris  Paul Weitz of American Pie fame, this uninspired remake of Warren Beattys 1978 fantasy Heaven Can Wait, itself a rehash of 1941s Here Comes Mr. Jordan, lacks the abrasively profane humor that won Chris Rock an Emmy for his first HBO special. Predictably, he spouts swear words from A to Z, but he consciously avoids the Fword. Anybody who saw this gifted AfricanAmerican comic in Lethal Weapon 4, Dogma, or Nurse Betty knows he can elicit more laughter with the Fword than Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy put together. Sadly, despite a few witty oneliners, Down To Earth hits Rock bottom both as a contrived comedy and an improbable interracial romance.Down to Earth utterly destroys any good will that the Weitz Brothers generated with their landmark grossout face American Pie. This disposable drivel qualifies as a contrived as well as confusing comedy with a thoroughly improbable colorblind interracial romance. Unfortunately, a more than competent cast\u0097among them The Full Montys Mark Addy, Chazz Palminteri of Analyze This, SCTVs Eugene Levy, and newcomer Brian Rhodes as Charles Wellington, Jr.\u0097are wasted in flatfooted, sketchy roles. Hardcore Rock fans will undoubtedly accuse their favorite comedian with trying to fix something that was never broken. Abysmally written by Lance Crouther, Ali Le Roi, Louis CK, and Rock, Down To Earth casts Chris as a messenger who rides a bike by day in the Big Apple and gets booed off the stage at night in Harlems celebrated Apollo Theatre. Poor Lance Barton Chris Rock suffers from severe stage fright. Nevertheless, his charitable manager Whitney Daniels Frankie Faison of Hannibal sticks with him through thick and thin. After Lance learns the Apollo Theatre will hold one final amateur night extravaganza, he implores Whitney to get him in the lineup. Excuse me, but if Lance is such a deadbeat standup comic, why does the Apollo keep inviting him back? Meanwhile, fate has something else in store for Lance. While pedaling home on his bike, our protagonist spots a pretty lady, Sontee Regina King of Jerry Maguire, crossing the street, but he does not see the bus that collides with him and kills him. Wham! Lance Barton levitates skyward with a halo wreathed around his head. In Heaven, which resembles a cruise ship nightclub, Lance learns that an overzealous angel, Mr. Keyes Eugene Levy of Stay Tuned, timed his death 40 years ahead of schedule.Heavenly honcho Mr. King Chazz Palminteri of Analyze This, Gods righthand guy, apologizes and escorts Lance back to earth. The snag is Lance cannot reclaim his corpse, so he must inhabit another body. The best that Mr. Keyes can come up with is ruthless, white, 60year old tycoon Charles Wellington. Wellingtons adulterous wife Amber Jennifer Coolidge of American Pie and his unscrupulous personal aide Winston Greg Germann of Sweet November have just tried to poison him. Reluctantly, before Wellingtons body vanishes, Lance accepts it conditionally as a loaner until Keyes can locate a more appropriate body. Meanwhile, LanceasWellington encounters Sontee again. She is a nurse activist protesting his decision to privatize a Brooklyn community hospital that serves the poor. While Regina King brings a surfeit of charisma to her role as a crusading health care worker, she plays a character who bypasses credible motivation in her affairs with Wellington. Although he is no longer black, Lance not only tries to woo Sontee but also win a gig at the Apollo.Down To Earth features Rock in his most unfunny role. The comedians reason for making this movie seems questionable. Reportedly, he ate lunch with Warren Beatty and told Beatty that he loved the original script that scenarist Elaine May had penned for Beatty. Initially, Beatty tried the racereversal gimmick himself in his own version by trying to cast Muhammad Ali in the title role of Heaven Can Wait. The deal fell through, and Beatty headlined the movie himself. According to Rock, his longtime cowriters and he thought that they could annihilate this classic. Moreover, he justified his choice of Heaven Can Wait based on his philosophy to Do Something you can only do when you are hot. Earlier, Rock rejected a script about a busload of touring rappers, because he saw little opportunity to stretch his image in such an outing. As a lifeless comedian in Down to Earth, Rock does not so much stretch his image as he inverts it for the worst! This halfbaked concert film with an annoying plot does as much to cremate his comic reputation as it does the Weitz Brothers! You know a film about a comedian is in dire straits when a scene at the nightclub is played so you cannot hear the jokes, only the laughter. Similarly, the casting of Mark Addy as Wellingtons butler who speaks the Queens English but is in reality a commoner from Michigan defies logic, too. Addy is an actual Englishman, and he does not have to fake an accent; his accent is genuine. The major overriding quandary with Down to Earth is the onagainoffagain, lookalike switcheroo that the characters make so Chris Rock does not disappear completely from the sight for more than a few seconds. Although Chris spends half the movie as white guy Wellington, audiences see him largely as Lance, undercutting the comic irony of watching his stocky, baldheaded, Caucasian white, alterego perform ghetto humor and chant derogatory hiphop lyrics. Incredibly, Rock served doubleduty as the films executive producer and one of its four scribes. The mystery is how such a wealth of talent could grind out such an awkward, misguided muddle of a comedy. About the only redeeming feature of Down to Earth is Jamshied Sharifis superb orchestral film score.","label":0},{"index":5520,"txt":"Imagine pulling back the mask of a lethal assassin and finding Barbara Cartland there... that is what happens with this film.The opening showed promise, but soon it drops all pretenses of being a thriller or even an imaginative love story and the only reason they made this story becomes abundantly clear to fill a gap in their female viewing market by creating yet another rehash of misunderstood, brooding badboy Andrei meets innocent, whimsical beauty Paula. Rather than waste any time in creating an original premise, the filmmakers went straight for the moneyshot the bad boy being tamed by said whimsical beauty. Thence follows a string of insincere and heavilyclich\u00e9d love scenes sprinkled with pseudo philosophicalpoetic fluff. Andreis admission of being eponymously a poet is levered in to round out the perceived qualities a Byronic hero should have  but even when we are told in heavy, underlined writing who and what he is, it is still difficult to believe it  or care.For a Byronic heroantihero to work, the story needs subtlety, style and innovation  all of which are utterly absent here. This is not a modern day Phantom of the Opera, it is just what happens when a weak and rather silly woman with loose knicker elastic dates a bad man, who, after meeting her, seems as dangerous as bunny slippers.The performances might have saved this film, had they been any good the female lead is preoccupied with looking sexy and otherworldly, no matter how forced or ridiculous; and poor Dougray Scott appears to have been drugged as he shambles through his part.

Putting aside the religious message, the story is as scary as they come. Add in even the slightest thought that the story might actually be close to something that might happen in the future and it becomes even scarier.This movie, and its sequels, did not try to bring in the reasons why the tribulation happened when it did. Left Behind and The Omega Code tried to get in everything Thief did and to explain all the politics and maneuvering in the Middle East leading up to it. The net effect was Thief did a much better job on the scary part of movie, instead of spreading itself too thin trying to explain what was happening in the Middle East at the same time.

I knew it was Utah right off the bat, but perhaps Dalton could not suppress his English accent, so they had to excuse it by saying this was a southern town. Subverting his accent into a Southern one was easier. Sure the film has plot twists, but its phony sense of place was something I could not get past. It is not like Utah does not have meth labs... so why the writers thought it necessary to pretend it was in the South is beyond me. One other thing in action pictures always puzzles me. Why do they always make the cocking sound effect when the character pulls out an automatic handgun? It seemed every other sound effect in this movie was a chukchich signifying a 9mm was loaded and ready to fire. Of course, the weapons already had rounds chambered so this was unnecessary. Lastly, the pyrotechnics were WAY over the top. But hey, this film was targeted to a certain market segment I suppose... It is too bad.

So what explains their lack of technological, economic, and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for success?Diamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox brought to North America by black slaves were our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 nonmilitary South Africans can defeat 10,000 Zulus without a single casualty in either case, then I think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant. With or without germs, we were going to succeed.He says Malaria stopped Europeans from colonizing further North, killing thousands of Europeans while not affecting Africans. I would like to know real numbers but he does not say. Then at the end he says today Malaria is killing thousands of Africans and that is why they cannot catch up with us. So which is it, Jared? Did Malaria help the Africans by halting Eurpeans or hurt them? And how come Europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history? He also seems far too eager to say that the reasons Europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck. At times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories he is reluctant to admit that maybe Europeans were successful because they worked for it. It is sad watch this obvious neoMarxist contort reality to try to prove his point.","label":0},{"index":5548,"txt":"This film is an attempt to present Jared Diamonds theory of Guns, Germs and Steel, explaining how Europeans have dominated much of the globe.The version I saw of this documentary came on 2 discs covering 3 hours.

There are completely useless scenes of Professor Jared Diamond watching birds through binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond failing to use a bow and arrow properly, Professor Jared Diamond firing a muzzleloader badly. Was this documentary supposed to make a hero out of Professor Jared diamond?. This part of the documentary was so bad, it could have been a spoof. The worst was when Diamond is shown breaking down and weeping when touring the malaria ward in an African hospital. None of this helps me understand his theory of Guns, Germs and Steel. BTW, Guns, Germs and Steel is said about 100 times. Can the Europeans guns, germs and steel get them out of this dire situation? Stay tuned and find out! When he finally gets down to business, his theory is equal parts interesting and utterly boring. Europeans conquered the natives peoples of other lands, because they had guns and fine blades against stone and wooden weapons. Do I really need a professor to convince me of this? The parts of his theory that explain how the Europeans came to have the advantages that allow the conquest are interesting, but the coverage is paperthin.In the end, I think the documentary was only trying to convince me that nonEuropeans are as capable as Europeans. If I am not a racist, I already know this. If I am a racist, Jared Diamond is not going to convince me with his bumbling use of native implements.I do not think adults are the intended audience for this documentary.

Can a rock band stoop any lower than has INXS to do such a shameful thing as this? The premise is simple and moronic. Audition a bunch of karaoke rejects to become the new lead singer of INXS, to take the place of Michael Hutchence who committed suicide in 1997. Eight years and no hits later, the band commit the ultimate act of patheticness by subjecting themselves to auditioning a bunch of talentless wannabes to be the new lead singer of a band that is 20 years past its prime. So they trot all of these awful singers I thought American Idol had its share of doozies who do atrocious renditions of just about every classic and predictable rock song imaginable. And then they cut to the INXS band members who are seriously discussing the merits of each of these candidates. You could see better and more original rock performers at just about any night club in any city in the world.It has all the usual uncreative elements of every other reality show. Lame reality participants, lame interviews, lame hostemcee, lame judging of performances, and the lame booting of one participant at the end of each show. Can these shows get any more predictable? It is clearly a publicity stunt on the part of the band; a last gasp of hope at rekindling their lost stardom before they are finally buried into oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if he had any shred of dignity when alive, has to be rolling over in his grave. Not that INXS were ever a great band, but I had no idea they were this pathetic. If INXS are at all representative of what rock and roll has become, this show would be the final proof that rock and roll is once and for all, dead.","label":0},{"index":5551,"txt":"I love all his work but this looks like nothing.. sorry..

A grown woman kissed a kid in the lips. come on is she mentally disabled? I mean an FBI agent who knows the countrys laws would risk her career to kiss a kid? she could get arrested on the spot! and the most creepiest part of all is that is not goodbye and she will see him in 6 or 7 years! oh dear and so he comes home to his family celebrating his birthday so the moral of the story is love and respect can be bought?

I mean, some screenwriter actually thought that this premise was fresh, original and lucrative. Then some moron with money believed in the script so much that he decided to fork some cash over with the naive misconception that he was going to make a return on it. Actors were cast, locations were scouted, makeup artists were hired, computer animators fresh out of Al Collins graphic Design School were brought in and this turd started to take form.There obviously were a ton of things that I hated about this move but the one thing the drove me the craziest was the overuse of music.

In the same section on the Festival now we have to complain the superfluous antithesis of Sue, Extension du domaine de la lutte, which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having NO sex is one and the same problem. But unfortunately we cannot sympathize with our hero how he is called by the storyteller, because he is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself. Own fault, I am sorry. I cannot understand him. Not enough, the writerdirectoractor want us admitting to him, that it is not his destroyed selfconsciousness or the passivity of his personality, what brought him so far, but the rotten society and its image of sexuality. Yes, there are some deeper insights about gender relations, but we will not follow him so far... And the point is, that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate, having no sex. Who did not notice yet, it is a quite depressing film...In the beginning, there had been some starts to be more accurate in sketching the situation. At the bed store the hero speaks about the hindrances buying a new bed. Perhaps it is too broad getting up the stairs, you have to stay at home half a day... THIS is a satire about a character, who does not know taking the life and heart in hands, DOING something... The movie doesnt follow this path, but handles his characters with helplessness. Nobody believes, that our hero is able to instigate Tisserand for a murder.

I guess scientists and forest rangers just do not think about those types of things.Then Sasquatch and his tribe get really angry and kill all the people we dislike, chases the other losers away and buries his Great Aunt Muriel and Cousin Josh who died in an unfortunate trout accident all over again.Insipid, boring dialogue I zoned out several times, inane plot, unlikable characters, bad CGI a man in a monkey suit would look better, and acting that just was not very good all add up to make a movie I will not be watching again.You check it out though; it is good for some unintentional laughs.","label":0},{"index":5575,"txt":"There have been many movies featuring Bigfoot, the majority of which are not good but most at least have a goofy charm to them. Sasquatch Hunters does not even have that going for it. It is just a crashing bore.Sasquatch Hunters is about a group of paleontologists, primatologists, and forest rangers that venture off into a remote part of a Pacific Northwest forest. Bones belonging to some sort of abnormally large primate have been discovered in this region and since apes are not natural to North America to begin with this leads to a scientific expedition. Sure enough, they soon discover a whole burial ground full of the skeletal remains of these enormous apelike creatures. I think we all know what happens to people that disturb ancient burial grounds in the movies.The first half of the movie consists of uninteresting, interchangeable characters assembling their gear, hiking through the woods, stopping to rest, hiking through the woods some more, pausing long enough to investigate and discuss a few findings along the way, yet more hiking through the woods, looking for a group member that has vanished, even more hiking through the woods, digging through dirt, random theorizing, and gathering around a campfire to discuss what little they have done that day. When Sasquatch finally shows up it just turns into people stumbling around in the dark while being picked off one at a time done in a blink and you missed it fashion and the actual killing occurs offcamera. All of this is excruciatingly boring.The movie wants to be taken seriously and the director is clearly trying to build suspense but there is none to be found, thus we are left with dull, drawn out scenes of people wandering around the woods just to get somewhere and wander around the woods at night trying to act scared. I would be lying if I said I did not make liberal use of the fast forward button to speed these scenes up.As for Sasquatch himself, much like every other character else in the movie, it does not have much to do and lacks a distinct personality. It looks like a shaggier version of King Kong, which is not all that bad except in the scenes where they used CGI instead of a man in a Bigfoot costume, which is painfully obvious during the daylight monster scenes. A part of me cannot help but feel that even using computer effects to bring Bigfoot to life is a tad sacrilegious. If there is any single movie monster that I believe should only be brought to life through situation, it is Bigfoot.This is one of those movies that does not so much have a plot as it does a premise. That is all it really is, a premise, which the people involved stretched out to make a feature length motion picture without bothering to add all the ingredients to make a worthwhile movie.","label":0},{"index":5576,"txt":"The French film Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte directed by iconoclast film maker Philippe Harel is based on the book of the same name written by a controversial writer Michel Houellebecq.He has also worked on this films scenario.According to British cinema magazine Sight and Sound,it is also known as Whatever.This film has been hailed as a breath of fresh air for French cinema due to its not so common theme of sexual politics and its implications on two stupid information technology workers.The film is marred by its much too evident voice over which introduces us to the main character.This makes us viewers feel as if we are watching a book that is bring read.

The idiotic comments people made at the time of its release about how quaint it was to see oldfashioned, handdrawn animation again, as if the last pencilanimated cartoon had been released twenty years ago, and the even more idiotic comments about how computers had now made the old techniques obsolete, had got my blood up ... but then, the insulting, flavourless banality I had to endure in the first ten minutes of Spirit got my blood up even more.The character designs are generic, the animation partly as a result merely competent, the art direction as a whole so utterly, boringly lacklustre that you wonder how it could have come about we know, from The Prince of Egypt and The Road to ElDorado, that there are talented artists at Dreamworks, and the sophisticated use of CGI is in every single instance illjudged. Why do they bother? There is not a single thing worth LOOKING at. In an animated cartoon, this is fatal.But it gets worse...The horses cannot talk, but they are far more anthropomorphised and unconvincing than the deer in Bambi, which can. And it seems that, in a way, the horses CAN talk. Spirit himself delivers the prologue sounding for all the world like a 21stCentury actor picked out of a shopping mall in California, and from then on his laidback, decidedly unhorselike narration is scarcely absent from the soundtrack, although it never once tells us anything that we did not already know, or expresses a feeling which the artwork, poor though it is, was not capable of expressing twice as well. That prologue, by the way a contains information which Spirit, we later discover, had know way of knowing; b expresses ideas which Spirit would lack the power to express even if he COULD talk; c includes new age rubbish like, This story may not be true, but it is what I remember; and d will give countless children the production is pitched, I presume, at sixyearolds the impression that horses are native to North America, which is sort of true, in that the common ancestor of domestic horses, zebras etc. WAS native to North America  but all horse species on the continent had gone extinct long before the first humans arrived, and the mustangs of Spirit is herd which allegedly belong here like the buffalo grass were descended from horses introduced by Europeans.So the prologue rather annoyed me.As often as Spirit talks, Bryan Adams sings, sounding as usual as though he is got a bad throat infection  and it is not THAT he sings or even HOW he sings, it is WHAT he sings maudlin narrative ballads which contribute even less, if possible, than Spirit is spoken narrative, and which sound as though they all have exactly the same tune although I was paying close attention, and was able to discern that they probably did not. If only Bryan Adams and the guypretendingtobeahorse could have SHUT UP for a minute or two, the movie might have been allowed to take its true form mediocre and derivative, rather than jawdroppingly bad.","label":0},{"index":5584,"txt":"Flat, soulless computer images on less than astonishing backgrounds animates a horribly predictable story in this film.

The narration is not needed, though, as everything happening is really obvious. You can even tell what the horses are saying, although all they do is neigh. Which would be good, but all the horses make exactly the same sounds  one for warning, one for sorrow, one for laughing, etc. There is no variation between the horses voices.Young kids might like this film, though. It is soppy enough for a family to sit down and watch, and there is little danger of anyone being frightened.

Avoid.","label":0},{"index":5588,"txt":"For anyone that loves predictable movies with an awful soundtrack, lack of dialogue, clich\u00e9s up the wazoo, and also stereotypes that just happens to be typical of an American film, look no farther. DreamWorks whether wanted to save money on acquiring voice talent, or really wanted to create an animated episode of National Geographic; either way, they succeeded in delivering a rather bland and boring movie. Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron is a bore fest that sends mixed signals to kids and adults, and also fails to entertain despite the ohsocutesy theme of animals triumphing over humans. After looking past the wonderful animations, what you have remaining is nothing but a big mess.Spirit is about a stallion that from the beginning of the film looks like quite a handful, as he is a horse that cannot be tamed, calmed, nor controlled. Because of this, he rises and becomes the leader of his group of highspirited horses, which includes his mom. But, his life of freedom and running around comes to an abrupt halt as he is captured by a group of Americans in the process of connecting the Wild West with the rest of the country. During this, Spirit never actually named that throughout the entire film almost befriends a courageous Native American, and a fellow female horse, and also has a lot of runins with the cynical and cruel Army folks that apparently do not believe in giving up.Why must movies mix computer animation with traditional? It comes off looking rather meshed, something Spirited Away suffered from as well. Best example is when a train is chasing after Spirit; you see the handdrawn Spirit running from a computeranimated train. It would look much better if it were one or the other, but not both; unless you can really pull off some nice effects. Beauty and The Beasts famous dance sequence uses computer animation, but it is nowhere near as obvious as the train or the snow in this movie. The opening sequence was the bestlooking part of the film, kind of sad to see the rest of the movie slide a bit downhill in terms of quality. A little scene has multiple; I mean multiple similar shots of just a generals face, quite repetitive and annoying in my opinion.The kids might enjoy this flick, but with lack of dialog, song, and motivation, it might be a perfect technique in making hyper children fall asleep. While Disney becomes criticized for its animated musicals, they wind up becoming much more entertaining than a more realistic approach to telling a story like this one. Bryan Adams has no place in this movie, and why does Hans Zimmer stay away from using a Western theme in this movie, when it is a story taking place in the Old West? Soundtrack sounds a bit off if you ask me. At least they are using realistic noises of horses, two points for that. Yet, if you are going to refrain from making horses talk, why even have a narrator interrupt every so often, which just so happens to be the main character himself?Native Americans are nice, and the Western folks are evil, Nativekilling, horse torturing, rowdy, psychopathic monsters that must be destroyed. More or less, this is what Spirit is showing us. It reaches a point in which they are trying so hard for the viewers to hate the travelers of the Wild West; they even had a scene of several horses pulling a huge train up a hill, and another scene of them destroying an entire village of Natives. Now, the person Spirit befriended happened to betray him, on more than one occasion, yet that is forgivable, apparently because he is not a soldier; that or because he has the sassy female horse.Spirit is not exactly a victim we should feel sorry for; the viewer is supposed to sympathize with Spirit despite him putting his entire group of horses at risk, wreaking havoc, and even perhaps resulting in some offscreen deaths that are quickly shoved aside because oh no, Spirit is in trouble! This film gets quite rhythmic, as we see in multiple instances Spirit escaping from chains, kicking people around, destroying property, freeing horses, and then getting captured againall in this same order too. The writers also seem to have an obsession with cliffs because they are sprinkled all over the movie; for an Old West film, they certainly have very little room to roam.Bottom Line This is most certainly no Disney movie, as a matter of fact that is a bad thing, even though it was what they were aiming for. So, instead of the typical musical, we get a boring film that becomes predictable, dull and slow in multiple instances. Even the decent animation becomes inconsistent when the computer work gets thrown in. Everything about this movie was just wrong; from the ideals that back then Americans that were not native were evil buffoons, to the soundtrack and musical score that just seemed so far off. Kill Bill Vol. 2, which pretty much has nothing to do with the Old West, has more of a Western feel than this movie. Do yourselves a favor and totally skip this by all means necessary. Thank you.","label":0},{"index":5589,"txt":"Some possible spoilers I am not too sure what Dreamworks was thinking when they decided to plunk 80 million down on this extremely tired and lame animated flick. They probably thought the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring audiences mostly families to see it in droves. Well it seemed to work for the opening weekend, it made 26 mil., roughly and has made 38.1 mil. total an estimation for this weekend. But I think audiences that came during the weekend saw pretty much the same thing I did, when I saw and they spread the word. This is one majorly lame movie, apart from the animation everything else, mostly the script seem to be done by a three year old. The movie is only about 80 mins. long, but it feels like a three hour epic. A few sticking points for me are, well the irritating narration is one of them, and it is so obviously written. At one point he escapes from some captors and even though you can see the horse is obviously scared, up pops the narrator the voice of the talented Matt Damon to clear up any misconceptions which would only happen in the simplest of mindsets. Another one is the constant pop up of Bryan Adams songs, now I am a fan of his music, I think he is good, but come on did Dreamworks really think audiences would be able to handle 89 of his songs throughout such a short movie, I certainly could not. Finally and heres a spoiler, a horse gets shot at point blank range by a member of the calvary, no less, she the horse then falls into a raging river, Spirit the focus of the movie tries to save her, but they both go over a waterfall that must have at least a 50 foot drop, well later in the movie near the end we see that this horse is alive and well. Now I know this is a kids movie, but even that little amount of realism is unacceptable.

The camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective. Clearly, the photography budget was excessive. The sound is bleached in a number of spots, and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse. The writing is appalling. This is one of those movies were the script writes itself.

And being French, it tries for depth by being enigmatic\u0085 nothing really makes any sense.L\u00e9o is gay and has just announced at breakfast to his family that he is HIV positive. The youngest brother, Marcel, has not yet come down to breakfast, and the first thing the family does is decide that at 12 years of age he is too young to be told. Maybe if he was four or five, but twelve? The first totally unbelievable thing is that the family does not even ask where or how he got the virus, how long he has known about it\u0085 nothing is asked. They only worry about Marcel finding out. This is a very close \u0096knit provincial family, but although they decide not to let Marcel know about L\u00e9os HIV positive status nor the fact of his being gay, the rest of the family accepts all this news with absolutely no questions or reactions. How many families do you know where the parentsbrothers would not have at least SOME reaction to one of the members announcing that he is gay? Here, nothing.L\u00e9o decides that he needs to go to Paris to see his exlover. And he decides to go on the trip with, of all people, Marcel. Do you know anyone who would bring his little brother along to go see a lover? Again, totally unbelievable, especially since Marcel is not supposed to know either of his medical problems nor of his homosexuality. If this is the way the family has decided to let him find out, it is rather brutal and again unbelievable.L\u00e9o goes to find his lover, Aymeric, at his work in a Paris bar. The owner says that Aymeric will not be there until the early evening. But why would L\u00e9o want to see him at work? Why not phone and arrange to see him in some place more private where they can really talk? Why not go and see him at his home? But no, L\u00e9o shows up later in the day with Marcel in tow and is surprised when Aymeric does not just drop everything to go walk with him for 5 minutes. Aymeric tells him that he is no longer available, that it was L\u00e9o who left him, and that L\u00e9o had not replied to any of his letters. L\u00e9o says But I love you and then wanders off. But if he really loved Aymeric, would not he have at least told him about his HIV status, to warn him to get tested and maybe get medication? This would be the least he could do \u0096 but not a peep. He leaves and does not even warn Aymeric that he might have contracted the AIDS virus. This is totally irresponsible of him \u0096 and of the filmmakers; this film was apparently made for a French TV series for young people \u0096 it is the perfect way to show kids how to be responsible. Well, not here\u0085 I guess Every man for himself is still the French way of doing things\u0085 Another aspect of the film which was totally unbelievable was the touchyfeely aspect. Everyone is always leaning against someone, caressing someone or kissing someone. Inside the family and outside the family. I have never seen anyone in France be THIS physical, never mind an entire family. Seated at the breakfast table, one 17 year old brother has his leg perched on the lap of his elder brother, and the elder brother is caressing his leg as everyone sits around discussing something. How many brothers do you know who are THAT physically close? In another scene, the same 17 year old comes into Marcels room asking What is the matter, cannot you sleep?, then takes off his clothes and, completely naked, gets into bed with his brother and snuggles up to him as if they were lovers. This and another similar scene between L\u00e9o and Marcel gave a somewhat incestuous feel to the film. Sorry, again I do not believe that this is regular behaviour between teenage brothers.The only good thing I can say about the film is that the actors are all quite fine\u0085 especially Marcel in the main role. But it was not really enough\u0085 HIV and AIDS are far too serious to be presented in such a vague and irresponsible light.

The makers of movies like that sortof treat the movie lightly, even if it is a heavy topic.

Now perhaps I viewed this movie from the tainted point of view of a theatrical director, but I was disappointed. I am sure people in the specific business of ballet choreography find this production impressive but from a purely theatrical perspective I found everything from design to choreography to be lackluster and unbefitting of a motion picture. None of the traditionally weird and impressive costumes looked like what they were supposed to be i.e. the candies did not look like candies, the rats did not look like rats but rather like chocolate kisses, the acting was weak, perhaps toned down too much for the screen, and the choreography just did not do anything for me. This makes the entire show very satisfactory at best, as if it were intended to not set itself apart from any other production.

The result is a completely forgettable firsthalf Christmas party where hardly anything happens and where even the dancing the little that there is of it is not particularly memorable.The pantomime overacting, particularly of Drosselmeier, which might look passable on the stage, just looks silly filmed for the big screen.Unfortunately, things are not much better when we get to the Kingdom of Sweets Act II in the stage version. Although there are a few choreographic highlights, most of the choreography is bland and uninspiring. This certainly is not vintage Balanchine.Balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance, but I have always felt he was less successful as a creator of narrative ballets.

S. television screens has reached a fevered pitch since the first episode of The Bachelor. Unsuspecting audiences have since been subjected to countless clones and variations, including The Bachelorette, Joe Millionaire, For Love Or Money, and the execrable Married By America. Hoping to cash in on this trend, and simultaneously tap and exploit a new demographic, Bravo has unleashed the disastrous Boy Meets Boy upon the world. And may they have mercy on us all.The premise is simple and is designed to be lighthearted an eligible gay man is courted by a number of suitors, eliminated show by show until one is left, but there is a twist. Half of the men are actually straight. This is not much of a big deal, but the inherent viciousness of the scenario kicks in after hearing the payoff if, at the end of the show, the gay man picks a straight man in disguise, the straight man wins a cash prize. The gay man gets nothing, or at least nothing more than a few parting gifts, a pat on the back, and a hearty round of Are not you embarrassed? Well, thanks for playing!Just the like the equally painful Queer Eye For The Straight Guy another Bravo program, this show is another example of stereotypes run amok. What makes it even worse, though, is the fact that straight men are playing UP these stereotypes for cash. The producers of this show believe that all you have to do is put enough hair gel in a mans hair, dress up in Abercrombie  Fitch with a pair of designer sandals, strip him of all body hair and fat and voila! It is the gay equivalent to putting a white performer in blackface, and just as offensive to those of us  like myself  who are genuinely gay and do not dressact like that. It implies that gays have no variance or chance for individuality, that they cannot behave like real people, only like stereotypes. Never mind the fact that the bank of suitors is sorely lacking in any kind of diversity. All are gymtoned, most are white, and all look far too scrubbed and cleaned.This is another example of how, instead of fostering acceptance of gays as dynamic individuals capable of variance and change, Hollywood has again taken a stereotype and run with it all the way to the bank. I feel genuinely dirty watching this show, as show any gay man who sees this unabashed parade of softcore pornography masquerading as legitimate television. 1 out of 10.","label":0},{"index":5604,"txt":"I really wanted to love this show. I truly, honestly did.For the first time, gay viewers get their own version of the The Bachelor. With the help of his obligatory hag Andra, James, a good looking, welltodo thirtysomething has the chance of love with 15 suitors or mates as they are referred to in the show. The only problem is half of them are straight and James does not know this. If James picks a gay one, they get a trip to New Zealand, and If he picks a straight one, straight guy gets 25,000. How can this not be fun?! Take my hand, lets stroll The most glaring problem with this show is the bachelor himself. James is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body, the one you would probably give two glances towards at your local bar before grazing for greener pastures. Why they chose to cast James as the leading man is beyond me. God knows there is so many other hotter and vivacious homosexual men out there dying to be on TV.Aside from his rather average physical appearance, James is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk. Even as such, he has this arrogant, smugly condescending aura about him. However, if James were standing up against a blank, white wall he would meld right into in it. I honestly cannot recall a single interesting or noteworthy thing James said during the course of the show. He is THAT boring and forgettable. In fact, one of the mates flat out advised him he was not feeling a connection. I thought that was the best part of the show. Also, James speaks with an excruciatingly annoying lilt. Sound feminine or sound masculine, but do not ing segue tones in the middle of sentences...so painful to sit through. I hated him so much all throughout the show I kept thinking, Please choose a straight guy and humiliate yourself and your unfortunate looking hagThen we have the suitors. A remarkably bland bunch of men who do not seem to care either way what is happening. Equally vapid, they seem to be indistinguishable from one guy to the next except, Hey that guy has blond highlights or oh that one has curly hair Again, astoundingly inept casting decisions seem to be the aim of this show. While it may be hackneyed to type cast roles, it would have been a lot more entertaining to watch than these amorphous drones. However, in all their banality they still manage to upstage James which is not all that hard to do anyway, slightly that is. You know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man. And the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around EACH OTHER than with the leading man? Very sad.Also, I just thought that Id point something mentioned on the message boards which I felt was actually true the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys. Do not get me wrong, Im not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring, as a matter of fact I found some of them very cute. It is just that overall they were just BLAH compared to the men you would see on shows like A Shot At Love with Tila Tequila or The Bachelorette.I do not know how many times I hit fast forward during this show. I can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box, I can accept the mundane, apathetic suitors but PLEASE for the love of God entertain me just a little. No such luck.If you are expecting drama, intrigue, sexiness, or excitement you will be SEVERELY disappointed. The biggest drama comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a boyfriend in New York How scandalous!. As titillating as that may be I guarantee you, that is the ONLY thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show.Sure there is the twist, but if you have any semblance of Gaydar in you, you will easily discern who is who it was not hard at all, I was only wrong once. This show is stacking so much of its chips on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else.We get to watch as James  Co plod along such exciting activities such as learning how to Western step dance, shopping for gifts, visiting a petting zoo, and gay karaoke. YAWN. Sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway. That is one of main problems with the show NO ONE seems to be enjoying themselvesthey are there just going through the motion trying mightily hard to appear to have a good time. And you really cant blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lame.Finally, the physical aspect is not there. There is no cuddling, no caressing, no kissing !, no endearment of any sort. It is just Ok that was a boring date, Im gonna go back to my ugly, tacky wannabe Sydney Operahouse dwelling quick peck on the lips CYA. This show is so ing prudish it is ridiculous. I can understand them not wanting to play up the perceived indiscretionary nature of homosexual men, but come the  on. People who watch reality TV shows are gonna want more than standoffish hugs and curt kisses. This show refuses to compromise.Sorry if this was long winded but I felt these were issues that needed to be addressed. I do commend Bravo for first putting up a show of this nature, but the staggeringly incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind boggling.

This review will reveal the ending of the movie, Scoop. If you do not want to know how the movie ends, do not read this review!Scoop is so bad you will think Annie Hall was a fluke.It gets one star because you get to see Hugh Jackmans naked chest. That is the only thing Scoop has going for it.Woody Allens misogyny, and his fixation on women young enough, at this point, to be his granddaughter, has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point.The plot seems promising a ghost, Ian McShane, directs a fluffy headed student, Scarlett Johansson, to investigate whether or not an English Lord, Hugh Jackman, is the notorious Tarot Card Killer of prostitutes. A magician, Woody Allen, helps the girl.Promising plot notwithstanding, the movie completely lacks charm, or humor, or atmosphere. It is an amazingly leaden, amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film, never mind dozens. Perhaps Allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press.Much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films, Woody Allen, now a septuagenarian, has FINALLY allowed a younger male lead to get the girl.Not so. In fact, the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one.There is an early scene where Johansson, for no reason central to the movie, allows herself to be gotten drunk, and seduced, by a powerful, older director. Seduced is a euphemism for what happens. It is a slam, bam, I have gotta go kind of moment. It bears no relation to the plot whatsoever, and it cheapens Johansson in the viewers eye. Why did Allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie? Because it shows a powerful director  like Allen  having sex with the female lead. Allen gets to have his cake and eat it, too.Johansson is not yet an actress. She does not know how to command the screen except by wearing a tight, low cut top. She imitates Allen in a couple of scenes, and that just looks weird and sad.It does not help that her character is scripted as a doll who cannot function without a ghost, or an elderly and less than aweinspiring magician, telling her what to do at every turn.She is approximately half Jackmans age, and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together.Audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines, and Jackman deserves better, too  a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency, and an actress who can convey those qualities.Hugh Jackman is similarly cheated by the script. Allen apparently cannot stand it that Jackman is so stunningly good looking and young, and so he gives Jackman nothing to say or do. Like Johansson, he is used merely for his good looks. This is a shame, because, as Jackman has shown in any number of productions, from Oklahoma to X Men, he CAN act.Heres the big plot twist  Jackman, suave, charming English Lord, really is a killer. So, though the movie says it is all about letting someone else, other than Allen, get the girl, she does not get anyone. Jackman, the man she is been making love to, is a man who murdered a prostitute. Nice, Woody. Nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp.In a passive aggressive touch, Allen deprives his heroine of his own presence, as well, killing off his character, the magician, leaving Scarlett Johansson all alone at the end of the film.A final note at my screening, not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film.

All of the plot lines generally have a really dumb lesson. In the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light unfunny joke.

John Stamos was the most tolerable character but he was so clich\u00e9d it was hard to watch him. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a genuinely bad actress and showed no emotion ever. The middle girl Stephanie was too clich\u00e9d as the annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed what bad actresses the Olsen twins were. You can always tell when they are switching them off. The plot lines to too many story lines were so unrealistically stupid it is cringe worthy.

Seeing such a phenomenal writer, actor, comic, director, and stunt man subjected to this humiliating spectacle is like seeing a Picasso used as a drop cloth, or perhaps more like seeing the finest Camembert adulterated with whey solids and processed into CheezWhiz. Keaton is illcast as Professor Post, whose overblown vocabulary is the only thing keeping him from saying, Tell me about the rabbits, George. Post would have said something like, Kindly inform me as to the status of the small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, kind sir, who I believe is primarily addressed with the epithet George. When Keaton created his own characters, they might be situationally clueless but they were not stupid. They were quick studies and became masters of their worlds. Not so with Post, who never stops stumbling and bumbling and who who has no more control of his destiny than a bilge rat had of the Titanic. And while Keatons original characters had a charming naivet\u00e9 and innocence, Post comes across as such a profound sexual retardate that if he ever did become physically aroused, he would put an ice bag on the swelling and seek medical help. There are a couple of small, redeeming moments, such as Keatons attempts to get rid of the vampish Thema Todd or his suggestion as to appropriate attire for a Greek dance, but it is just not worth enduring the entire film to see them.If you are a fan of bad movies, get drunk and watch Speak Easily with friends, a la Mystery Science Theater 3000. But other than that, stick with the silents. Let them be 100 of what Buster Keaton is remembered for.","label":0},{"index":5634,"txt":"What is the most harrowing movie ever made? The gynaecological nightmare of Cries and Whispers? The acid psychodramas of Fassbinder? The discomfiting black comedy of Last House on the left? I am sure for that portion of the filmloving public that tie their masts to the good ship Buster Keaton, there is only one answer  any one of his sound films. I do not know what flayed my soul more poignantly in this movie  the grounding of Keatons intricate and expansive physical art to humdrum slapstick; the painful hesitation of this master filmmaker with dialogue  not that he has not a lovely, comic voice, or that he cannot make dialogue funny; it is just that the studio do not seem to have given him enough takes, and so he seems to be trying to remember his lines before he delivers, which only makes him  Keaton, not his character, look silly; or is it the humiliation of seeing Keaton caught up in a tawdry sex farce, when he has given us some of the richest accounts of romantic frustration in film? No, I know what was most disturbing  having to watch Buster Keaton, cinemas greatest comedian, sit aside to observe Jimmy Durante doing his schtick. It is horrors such as this that get yer Dantes composing yer Infernos.MGM seem to have got the curious idea that the best way to adapt Keaton to sound was to turn him into a Marx Brother, complete with verbal pedantry, elaborate, tedious clowning, shambolic slapstick, theatrical setting, triumph through chaos, and Thelma Todd. Keaton was just not that sort of comic, and where Grouchos malicious tongue and gleeful opportunism might just have made this plot work, Busters socially inept professor cannot, he is too studied and predictable. What Buster needed was to be allowed experiment like Lang in M, or Rene Clair; he would never have tried to hold back the tide like Chaplin. When a film like The General is alluded to  messing about with trains  the loss becomes even more apparent. And the thing is, in patches amid the flat direction, the film is not all that bad  there is an excellent jolt when a camera on the bus leaves Keaton alone at a railway station; and the denouement, if hardly original, is at least livelier than what went before. There is something almost endearing about the way Keaton slows down a plot that needs all the zip it can get. There is a film in here about loneliness, emotionally paralysing order, the numbing effects of education etc., struggling to get out. The best way to appreciate this film is to watch not the narrative of Professor TZ Post, but of emasculated genius Buster Keaton, trapped in a prison of mediocrity, confounded by new technology, mocked by a malevolent fate in this case the studio, retaining a stoical grace. Looked at like that, it becomes a kind of masterpiece.","label":0},{"index":5635,"txt":"To be a Buster Keaton fan is to have your heart broken on a regular basis. Most of us first encounter Keaton in one of the brilliant feature films from his great period of independent production The General, The Navigator, Sherlock Jnr. We recognise him as the greatest figure in the entire history of film comedy, and we want to see more of his movies. Here the heartbreak begins. After Steamboat Bill Jnr, Keatons brotherinlaw Joseph Schenck pressured him into signing a contract that put Keaton under the control of MGM. Keaton became just one more actor for hire, performing someone elses scripts. Then his alcoholism got worse. After Steamboat Bill Jnr, Keaton never again made a truly firstrate film. A couple of sources describe a wouldbe masterpiece comedy that Keaton claimed he almost got to make at MGM a parody of Grand Hotel. Biographer Tom Dardis has offered convincing evidence that Keaton made up this story.The heartbreak increases because, among the many years of Keatons long steady decline, he just occasionally came up with a good film ... such as his short comedy Grand Slam Opera. I continue to search for the lost footage of Keatons dramatic scene with Spencer Tracy in It is a Mad Mad World a sequence in which embittered cop Tracy telephones an old retired crook Keaton and tries to recruit his assistance in stealing Smiler Grogans cash. That footage is almost certainly gone forever, but I keep looking.Speak Easily, alas, is one of Keatons films from the beginning of his decline. MGM were trying to build up Jimmy Durante who, coincidentally, played Smiler Grogan three decades later as a new comedy star. Unfortunately, MGM tried to build up Durante by teaming him with Keaton, whose style of comedy was simply incompatible with Durantes. I am a fan of both. Throughout his career, Durante was a merciless scenestealer commendably, he knew that he was being built up at Keatons expense, and Keaton was the only costar whom Durante never attempted to upstage.Keaton was often cast as the victim of extremely cruel machinations. In Speak Easily, he plays a didactic and humourless Midwestern college professor named Post because he is as wooden as one who receives a letter informing him that he is inherited 750,000, which he must travel to New York City to claim. Does he make a phone call to verify this? Does he even check the postmark? No; he takes his lifes savings out of the bank and rushes to New York. As soon as he is gone, Posts manservant confesses that he wrote the fake letter to jostle Professor Post out of his rut!Post, who thinks he is a 34millionaire, crosses paths with Jimmy Dodge Durante, who is trying to produce a musical revue but has not any money. The characters which these two brilliant comedians are playing onscreen simply fail to intermesh. Keaton is playing one of those eggheads like Mister Logic in Viz who intellectualises everything. Durante plays one of those annoying hepcats who is incapable of making any straightforward statement because the script requires him always to speak in slang. There is a painfully unfunny dialogue scene in which Durante is trying to talk to Keaton about money, but  instead of coming straight out with it  Durante has to use increasingly contrived slang terms like kale, cartwheels and so forth ... while Keaton of course has no idea what Durantes on about. I will give Keaton credit his own dry and dusty prairie voice, his flat Kansas accent, is absolutely perfect for the character he is playing here.Sidney Toler, looking much leaner and more handsome here than he would be just a year later, is impressive as the excitable director of the revue bankrolled on tick by Professor Post. Henry Armetta, whom I have never found funny, is even less funny than usual here, offering a running gag with a stupid payoff. Thelma Todd impressed me here, in a more villainous version of the role she played in Horse Feathers a much funnier movie. Edward Brophy, one of my favourite character actors, is wasted.Part of the problem with Speak Easily is that supporting characters behave in completely inappropriate ways. Keatons lawyer shows up at Durantes theatre with an urgent message for Keaton ... but he is not there, so the lawyer proceeds to divulge Keatons personal business to the first total stranger he meets. Fire that lawyer, Buster! In another scene, Professor Post  the guy who is perceived as bankrolling this musical  blunders into the chorus girls changing room, and all the chorus girls immediately squeal and cover themselves. I know for a fact that modern chorus girls would never react this way, and I seriously doubt that chorus girls in 1932 behaved that way either ... certainly not in response to the angel controlling their show is pursestrings.SPOILERS COMING. About half an hour into the unfunny Speak Easily, the great Jimmy Durante seats himself at the piano, grins into the camera, and does that distinctive little shake of his head as he starts to play a tune. This is the moment when I thought that, at long last, this movie was finally going to settle down to its purpose of entertaining us. Alas, no. Most annoying of all is the ending of this film, which uses the single most hackneyed and implausible cliche in all of comedy the one in which an utterly incompetent dimwit becomes a star comedian through his own ineptitude. Keaton would be forced to replay this cliche in a 1955 episode of Screen Directors Playhouse; Chaplin had already used it in The Circus.I very nearly wept  in anger and sorrow  at the wasted opportunities in Speak Easily. Mostly out of respect for the work that Keaton, Durante, Toler, Brophy and Miss Todd have done elsewhere, I will rate this movie 2 points out of 10.","label":0},{"index":5636,"txt":"For most younger viewers out there, they probably have no idea who Buster Keaton was. So, because of this, they probably will not feel nearly as sad when watching this film as I did. I happen to be a silent comedy freakhaving see just about every Keaton film still in existence. My being a huge fan made this film very painful from start to finish. This is because during his silent days, Keaton was a very vibrant and creative comedian. He was amazing in his physicality and his films were almost never dull. However, in a move that movie historians still are baffled by, at the end of the silent era, Keaton gave up his independence and became a stock MGM actor. Instead of being a great creative force, MGM now saw Keaton solely as an actorand they wrote scripts for him that had no respect for what made him great. At first, these films with MGM were not that bad such as THE CAMERAMAN but with talkies, the studio really blew itputting him in several films with Jimmy Durante. Durantes humor was based on his gift for gab and was abrasive. Keaton, in contrast, was quiet and based on action. Two more unlike and incompatible actors would have been hard to find. As a result of this deadly combination, Keaton made some truly dreadful films.Now this is not to say that SPEAK EASILY is a terrible film. No, instead it is just more of a timepasser and an amazingly unfunny one at that. In fact, if you go into the movie assuming it is a comedy, it will probably make the film harder to enjoy. Instead, it is sort of like a drama with a few comedic elements. It is NOT a film that will produce belly laughsespecially for Keaton fans.The film begins in an odd setting. Keaton is cast as a college professor whose entire life is teaching. He knows nothing of the world and has his nose stuck in his books. In a bizarre move, Keatons servant tricks him into believing Keaton has received 750,000 from a dead relativehoping that this would spur Keaton to get out and enjoy life. This is amazingly contrived but somehow it manages to work. Not terribly well, but it works.Keaton immediately leaves school and goes on a journey to New York to have some fun. On the way there, he meets up with an incredibly untalented theater troop. Because he knows nothing of the world, he does not seem to realize they stink. And, because he thinks he is rich, Keaton decides to take them all to New York to perform on Broadway. However, just before the show opens, his friends find out that Keaton is NOT rich. So, they decide not to tell Keaton and try to keep him away from process servers that want to close the show. They assume that if the show is a hit, then they can pay off the debts and everyone will be happy. However, they forget that the show itself stinks. What are they to do? And, will Keaton get the nice girl, get roped by a gold digger Thelma Todd or be flat broke and alone? If you care, see the film.As for Keaton, he has few stunts in the film, though there are some dandy ones near the end. Instead, Keaton just kind of walks through the part in a very subdued manner. There is really little to love about this film or hate. It is just blah....when it SHOULD have been a heck of a lot better.","label":0},{"index":5637,"txt":"I feel the movie did not portray Smith historically. The goal of this movie was to tell Smiths life in a way that would be comfortable to the LDS Church leaders, historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern. The movie was designed to be a faith promoting experience, not a balanced view of Smith as a man. I have taken it upon myself to study Smiths life and have read both LDS works and none LDS works. The movie, like most LDS projects, was beautifully filmed and well acted. However, this was not a realistic portrayal of either the beginnings of Mormonism or Smiths relatively short life.A significant period of time was given to reenacting an accident that Smith had when he was seven. While this event was no doubt important in forming his mental outlook, it appears that the main reason for including it in the film is to help establish a sympathetic view of Joseph Smith. Another point is in portraying Smiths teen years the film is silent regarding the Smith familys involvement in magical practices during the 1820s. Another problem is while the movie shows Joseph Smith goodnaturedly entering into wrestling contests, it fails to show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent.I could go on and on. This movie was not historical in any way and should be considered a fictional movie about a man. I would not recommend seeing this movie for any other purpose other then entertainment.","label":0},{"index":5638,"txt":"I saw this film over the weekend and while I was impressed as always with the beauty and polish of Churchproduced films, I left disappointed that this one fell so short, failing to inform members and leaving investigators with many unanswered questions.The film is 70 minutes of vignettes from the life of Joseph Smith. It is not a true biopic because there is no real coherent narrative. Most of the episodes concern Joseph doing good deeds, playing baseball, running races and laughing with children, often in sloooow motion. What a great, just folks kind of guy that Joseph was, huh? Look at him out there beating rugs for his wife Emma. Well, howzbout the rugs of his 33 plural wives?? No mention whatsoever is made of polygamy. A glaring omission.And it is in such omissions where the film falters. It supplies too little information and leaves critical thinking audience members wondering WHY is Joseph getting tarred and feathered, WHY is he getting thrown in jail and WHY does that mob want to kill him? The films climax is of course Joseph and Hyrums trek to Carthage jail riding past a veritable United Nations of faces looking out from Nauvoos doorways. But no mention is ever made about WHY. Nothing about Smith suppressing the Nauvoo Expositor newspaper and ordering its press destroyed for its revealing the secret teaching of polygamy. The audience is left to wonder or to assume it is just more baseless persecution of the Church. No mention of Joseph being charged with treason for declaring martial law and calling out the Nauvoo militia.Of course I certainly did not expect this Churchproduced film to present the Joseph of Richard Bushmans recent biography Rough Stone Rolling, but I was surprised and taken aback at just how little of substance was actually presented.And worse, what substance that was presented was often inaccurate. Two examples jumped out at me. First, the translation of the Book of Mormon. The film shows Joseph reading right off the golden plates in their tworing binder, which plates in reality were hidden far from the site. It is well known that Joseph did his translating by burying his face in his hat, peering at the seer stone in there. The second inaccuracy occurs at Carthage jail, where the mob storms the cell. The History of the Church reports that Joseph had a sixshooter and even fired off a few rounds before jumping out the window and giving the Masonic signal of distress as reported in Times  Seasons.Maybe showing the reality of the gunfight would have shattered the hearttugging mood the filmmakers had created, but by omitting it they were unfaithful to history and failed to show Joseph as he really was handy with a gun and able to defend himself. In fact, the impression the film gives is that Joseph was a nice guy, but also something of a milquetoast that everybody beat up, tossed in jail and eventually murdered in cold blood. He was far from that; Joseph was a disciplined and determined man who endured a lot of hardship and struggle to bring to fruition that in which he believed.See the film, but know going in that is it is cotton candy. Then get your meat and potatoes by reading a copy of Bushmans biography of Smith, Rough Stone Rolling PS Churchproduced films have no credits, but seasoned eyes can pick out a couple familiar faces. Rick Macy is excellent as Joseph Smith, Sr. and Bruce Newbold, beloved as Thomas in Finding Faith in Christ, here plays the cranky Methodist minister who failed to show Christian love to a young seeker after Truth.","label":0},{"index":5639,"txt":"Damn, I thought I would seen some bad westerns.

Heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw Coburn. The hunt becomes even more personal when Hestons daughter Barbara Hershey is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation.

It is tremendously disappointing really, because the star pairing sounds like a mouthwatering prospect. There is no sense of pace or urgency in the film either.

Andrew McLaglens direction is limp, and the final 30 minutes or so are a real botch, with some incomprehensible strategy on the part of heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum.

There was something callous about the whole treatment of the rape scene, and the womans reaction afterwards certainly did not ring true. Coburn is plenty nasty as the half breed escaped convict out for revenge, but all of his fellow escapees are underdeveloped they are like bowling pins to be knocked down one by one as the story lurches forward.

While the latter lays a trap for him, Coburn outwits Heston by kidnapping his daughter Barbara Hershey. Naturally, the former lawman \u2013 accompanied by Hershey\u2019s greenhorn fianc\u00e9 Chris Mitchum \u2013 sets out in pursuit of Coburn and his followers, all of whom broke jail along with him.Rather than handling the proceedings in his customary subFordian style, McLaglen goes for a Sam Peckinpah approach \u2013 with which he\u2019s never fully at ease repellent characters, plenty of violence, and the sexual tension generated by Hershey\u2019s presence among Coburn\u2019s lusty bunch. Incidentally, Heston and Coburn had previously appeared together in a Sam Peckinpah Western \u2013 the troubled MAJOR DUNDEE 1965; I really need to pick up the restored edition of this one on DVD, though I recently taped the theatrical version in panandscan format off TCM UK.

At least, though, Heston maintains a modicum of dignity here \u2013 his ageing character attempting to stay ahead of halfbreed Coburn by anticipating what his next move will be; the latter, however, tackles an uncommonly brutish role and only really comes into his own at the climax relishing his moment of vengeance by sadistically forcing Heston to witness his associates\u2019 gangrape of Hershey. Apart from the latter, this lengthy sequence sees Heston try to fool Coburn with a trick borrowed from his own EL CID 1961, the villainous gang is then trapped inside a bushfire ignited by the practiced Heston and the violent death of the two obsolete\u2019 protagonists as was his fashion, Heston\u2019s demise takes the form of a gratuitous sacrifice!.The supporting cast includes Michael Parks as the ineffectual town sheriff, Jorge Rivero as Coburn\u2019s Mexican lieutenant, and Larry Wilcox \u2013 of the TV series CHiPs! \u2013 as the youngest member of Coburn\u2019s gang who\u2019s assigned the task of watching over Hershey while doing his best to keep his drooling mates away!.

Lifes too short","label":0},{"index":5649,"txt":"First of all my heartfelt commiserations to anyone who bought a cinema ticket in the hope of seeing a film in the same mould as the fantastic Gregorys Girl and Local Hero but ended up leaving the theatre feeling disappointed and vaguely cheated. While it is true that sequels are usually, bar a few notable exceptions, a mistake and exist merely to provide studio executives with an opportunity to cash in on the success of a previous film by offering us either a thinly disguised retread of the original story or a plot line so far removed from the intentions of the original that the resulting film makes no sense. In the case of Gregorys Two Girls, Bill Forsyth has the dubious honour of managing to commit both sins  on the one hand revisiting the plot of Gregorys Girl, while at the same time serving up a frankly incredible and moronic storyline involving Scottish arms dealers. Schoolboy Gregory is now a teacher at the same school where at the tender age of sixteen, he harboured a hopeless passion for the football playing Dorothy. Although now thirty five, Gregory still harbours a hopeless passion but now for the football playing Frances, also sixteen, despite the fact that music teacher, Bel has made it clear that she is attracted to him. His passion for Frances and his desire to impress her lead to his involvement in a scheme to expose a local arms dealer who also happens to be an old schoolfriend. There is no point in going any further as the rest of the story is forgettable and the ending makes no real sense at all. The main problem lies with the character of Gregory himself, in that there is no sign of the endearing and charming sixteen year old Gregory who actively and comically pursues Dorothy convinced that he would eventually win her over. At thirty five, Gregory is presented to us as a rather sad and friendless creature whose life is neither active nor comic. Outside of work his time is spent watching videos of Noam Chomsky and reading magazines about international injustices. As his friends and family from the previous film have seemingly vanished, save two pointless scenes with his younger sister, who no longer offers him advice or seems at all interested in his life, we are left confused about what it is Gregory really wants, who he is and why he is the way he is. Why for example is he friendless? Why does he never see his father, who is clearly still alive? Why has he returned to teach at the school he once attended? Why is he so interested in Noam Chomsky and injustice? Why has he become so apathetic? Why is he attracted to Frances? Why is not he attracted to Bel until the last twenty minutes of the film? What in heavens name do Bel or Frances see in him as he is neither drop dead gorgeous or even interesting? Why does he continue to try and impress Frances even after he and Bel have become an item and when their association threatens to completely disrupt his life? Are we really to believe that a Scottish arms dealer openly selling weapons of torture to oppressive regimes could manage to evade media scrutiny but fall foul of a couple of schoolkids? Does Gregory really think that dumping a handful of computers into the sea will change anything? To make matters worse, actor John Gordon Sinclair attempts to rehash his performance as the adolescent Gregory right down to the facial expressions and awkward body language. Unfortunately on a thirty five year old it just comes across as odd and vaguely creepy. On top of that, it is hard to feel any sympathy for, or empathy with a teacher who has erotic dreams involving sex with one of their uniform wearing pupils while they both lie on a pile of gym mats. Rather than being amusing it simply smacks of paedophilia. It is hard to know what was going through Bill Forsyths head when he wrote this script or why he thought fans of the original film would embrace a story so completely lacking in the charm, wit and warmth that turned the first movie into a classic. I can only assume that the plan was to craft a film about a man who was refusing to grow up and commit to adult life and perhaps whose happiest memory was of being sixteen and pursuing the best looking girl in the school but who by degrees is forced to accept that a life lived in the past is no life at all.That at least could have been the basis of a film which was thematically interesting and intelligent. As it is Gregorys Two Girls adds up 116 wasted and pointless minutes saying nothing and signifying even less. Gregorys Girl was responsible for launching Bill Forsyths career, heres hoping that Gregorys Two Girls will not be responsible for sinking it.","label":0},{"index":5650,"txt":"As one of the few commentators not to have seen the 1st film, I found this to be a very disappointing movie.Yes, it has a funny awkward type of humour if you can bear the highly morally dubious premise.

Vague, longwinded and inconclusive. The lack of any substantial ending is so infuriating and what is present is pompous and wholly illogical. The film feels halffinished.Suspension of disbelief is extremely difficult when witnessing a very attractive female teacher Maria Doyle Kennedy can be drawn to Gordon Sinclairs unimpressive character, especially when he fends off her advances.

Castle of Blood is, in my estimation, one of the finest, although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings. In an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent The Others, which was in the theaters a couple of years ago.Director Antonio Margheriti remade his own picture in 1970 titling it this time Web of the Spider AKA Nella Stretta Morsa del Ragno. Why he did this I do not understand, although the remake starred Anthony Franciosa and Klaus Kinski and was very good in its own right. Perhaps he saw a good story and wished to tailor it more to American audiences. I do not really know. It is interesting that he did the original in black and white and the remake in color.Castle of Blood is excellent Italian Gothic. La Danza Macabra is said to be an unpublished work of Edgar Allen Poe, who appears in this film. Poe and Lord Blackwood, owner of a haunted castle, bet American writer Alan Foster George Riviere that he cannot spend All Souls Night in said castle and survive. Foster eagerly accepts the bet but soon regrets it, for he is witness to a series of murders committed by ghosts. It seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years but are doomed to reenact the crimes they committed in life. Lord Blackwood conveniently forgot to tell Foster that his blood is needed for them to resurrect themselves on the next All Souls Night! It does not take Foster and the beautiful Elisabeth Blackwood portrayed by the incomparable Barbara Steele long to fall in love, even though their romance is doomed, because Elisabeth is one of the ghosts. I will not give the ending away, but will just say that Castle of Blood is every bit a romantic tragedy as it is a horror story. Comments. This film is greatly atmospheric, even by the excellent standards of the Italians. My personal opinion is they do true horror better than anybody, and the somewhat dim black and white filming only enhances this. In fairness, Web of the Spider was fine in its own right, even with color and greater brightness. I loved the lingering shots, something most modern day directors do not have the patience for. Indeed, when Alan first enters the doomed castle, we are treated to several minutes of him doing nothing but roaming around from room to room, the dread ands unease building in his face and mannerisms. By the time the first ghost appears, the audience is thoroughly primed and ready. There is wonderful dialogue between Alan and the ghosts, something else not often done in standard ghost stories. There are also memorable scenes, very visual for this type of film. Elisabeths murder and the dance scene reminds somewhat of the similar dance of the ghouls in 1962s Carnival of Souls were particularly good.Sadly, few general interest viewers will ever hear of, much less see, this film.

Being a family lawyer I have heard many such accounts; the man depicts himself as noble and always correct, and the woman is a hellion who has had no other objective than to exploit the man.Indeed, unless one is willing to laugh at the social assumptions of the film maker, this is an uncomfortable movie to watch. Phillip even indulges Mildred when she brings over a baby of indeterminate paternity, but the real high point comes when Phillip allows Mildred  enraged and now of dubious sanity  the free run of his flat, with predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but that period did not occur here. In fact, by the end of the movie she looks a lot like the Baby Jane character she would play thirty years later.I note how Howards character is always impeccably dressed and groomed. It tells me that Phillip craves middle class respectability. Someone like that could not run from a woman with a course Cockney accent fast enough. Phillip is, for most of the movie, a student; such a person would have been more believable if he had been younger, and had the disheveled looks that bespeak the low income and the low self esteem that often accompanies student status  an English Raskolnikov, as it will.

These remarks come from someone who finds Kane and Ambersons to be amazing, worthy films. But the remainder of Welles career is, unfortunately, squandered on material unworthy of his talent and too flimsy to withstand his filmic embroidering. And when he makes a potboiler like Shanghai, the lack of anything substantial to hang his filmic tricks on, is just kind of sad. I could not tell you what he was exploring here. It is all as mannered as Welles godawful Irish brogue; which takes a lot of effort, but adds absolutely zero to the film. Several Welles projects became this overdeveloped and baroque. Mr Arkadin pick a version, any version is a similarly belabored project. The material is inconsequential. It just cannot bear the weight of all this noodling. For a director trafficking in realitybased drama as here, he never feels any pull to tie his bundle of conceits back to reality; or to a coherent story. The murderforhire scheme is ridiculous. Kudos to Welles though, for having Hayworth cut her hair, and getting that performance out of her. The camera loves her. She is the classiest, most upscale, sultry and ravishing femme fatale ever put on film. But her treachery comes so late in the film it feels like some desperate decision, made so the movie will have some genre it fits into. The movie cannot be saved by a noir convention deployed in the last 60 seconds.When all is said and done in L.F.S., the convolutions are all for what?; to convince you you have seen something thoughtful? to give Welles more to do? to make you roll your eyes? Welles has no sensitivity to the scale of a story, or to telling a story directly. One wonders what Shanghai has to say to anyone who is not a crippled billionaire, arranging a quadruplecross murderforhire scheme, or a fanboy in love with filmic conceits devoid of meaning or substance.

Were it not for the poignancy of the concept of the film, this would fall into the category of the many films about the ruination of the world by a rampant nonprejudicial infective organism.Stefan Tom Wlaschiha journeys from Berlin to San Francisco to investigate his fathers scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the convicts in whom it was infused. He meets with some disdain and resistance to a dead theory, but also encounters some folks who know of the theory and support his investigation. Simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place, each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by strains of music from Puccinis opera Turandot which just happens to be opening at the San Francisco Opera. A police investigator Louise Tolliver Irit Levi and her companion cop Kalene Parker follow the murders while Stefan makes the rounds of the sex clubs and bars in San Francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his fathers theory. He encounters a strange lad Jeffrey Jim Thalman with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent Doctor Burroughs Richard Conti who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects. How this all come to an end is the play of the film, a story as much about the search for self identity between Stefan and Jeffery as it is a case for investigation of murders.While Tom Wlaschiha, Jim Thalman and Richard Conti do well with their roles they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film!, the quality of the film sags considerably by the less than acceptable minimally talented Irit Levy and Kaylene Parker when on screen the credibility of the story drops below zero. There are some small cameos by other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit, but in all the film is drowned by the incessant replay of Nessun dorma as sung by Mario del Monaco from a recording o the opera  and that seems to be the reason for making the film!

So the idea of having the redundant plot return seems doomed from the start .

According to the trivia page the budget was so low the producers could not get any stock footage of Saturn so when astronaut Steve West mentions how beautiful Saturn looks we get footage of the sun . Actually the sun gives the most impressive performance in the film since the human actors would not be employed by a porn studio . If I was appearing in this I would not be scared by the eponymous monster  I would be terrified of splinters from the rest of the cast . Perhaps we should be slightly forgiving though since the obvious lack of budget manifests itself in things like the actors having to wear their own clothes . A general for instance does not wear his nice fancy dress uniform complete with medals  he wears a denim jacket and baseball cap There has to be suspension of disbelief for a film like this to work but it fails on every level .

Instead of the police getting a call saying there is been a murder Dr Nelson just decides to track down his patient on his own own same as he would look for a missing cat . It is also strange a thoroughly decomposing homicidal monster can walk down the road without anyone noticing , but this is typical of a film where horny 70 year olds stop their car down dark roads for a quickie and people nonchalantly mention their wife is pregnant whilst forgetting to tell the police that there is a monster on the loose .THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN is Z grade rubbish .

I guess that after that he goes out and eats human flesh in order to slow down the melting process. There is some weird subplot involving an old couple getting chased by a dog, some dismembered head floating down a stream, and an ending involving a man being electrocuted.

Being a lover of schlocky films, I am making it a point to try to find some of the films from the documentarynot just including THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN. In fact, MELTING MAN is the first bad film I have seen since then and I must say I am rather disappointed. While it truly is a bad film, it comes nowhere near close enough to make inclusion on this list.Now before seeing the documentary, I have enjoyed bad films ever since I read the book The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time by Harry Medved. Despite the same title, the book came out long, long before the documentary and the makers of the documentary never credited Medved with the concept. From the Medved book, I have seen about 35 of the 50 films but have come to an impassethe rest of the films just are not available on VHS or DVD. So, I thought I would try the film by the same name.The reason I was most disappointed with THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN was that there were a few good elements to the film. First, the melting guy special effects were generally really cool and disgusting. It is obvious that a professional the famous Rich Baker was involved in making this look realistic. However, I should also point out that there were also more than a few cheap and cheesy effects as wellsuch as the floating plastic head and the way the monster ran around after his left arm was cut offyou could see it cleverly hidden under his clothes! As for the story, it is just stupid. A group of astronauts miraculously penetrate the rings of Saturn without being crushed. Then, they comment about how beautiful the sun isas we see closeups of it. This is odd since Saturn is so far from itit should NOT look this wayit should be a large speck. Regardless, immediately the scene changes and we are told that one of the surviving astronauts is in a hospital. What happened between the last scene and this one? Yep, it is anyones guess. Well, soon after, the survivor escapes and engages in a murderous rampage as his entire body melts.Now considering they have a psycho running about who looks like a melting popsicle, you would think the government would pull out all stops to find and stop him, right?! Wrong. A general engages one lone doctor to find him!! No army, no policejust some dopey doctor. Even after bodies begin stacking up, at no point do the doctor or general do anything to organize a meaningful search or get backup.Now, given the stupidity of the film, you also would not be surprised to find the following When the melting dude is running around near the doctors house, the doctor gives his wife a powerful sedative and leaves her in the house.When a cute old couple is driving late at night, they naturally stop in an orchard to pick fruit and are killed.When a lady sees melting dude, she barricades the door to protect herself. This would be smart IF she did not have the back door of the house next to her! Instead of just leaving the house and escaping, she just waits! When a photographer and his model are taking snapshots, the guy grabs his assistant and yanks off her top. Why? Well to give the audience a cheap thrill and make it a rated R flick.When the melting dude is finally located and the sheriff has a clear shot at him, the doctor stops himeven though by now the monster had killed about a half dozen people.So, as you can see the film abounds with stupid plot elements. It is a very bad film. But, given the occasionally good special effects, it just was not a horrible film like I would hoped. Sure, it is good for a laugh, but no where near PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE in badness and never should have been included on anyones worst film list.","label":0},{"index":5701,"txt":"Why do I constantly do this to myself?

As for creepy, I will give the nod to that horny old geezer couple sucking on lemons just before lights out. Now they were truly scary.Something I could never figure out in horror flicks was why a monsters victims would not simply just run away when faced with virtual annihilation. Like the chick in the cabin. You know, there was a door completely visible right there in the kitchen that she could have run right out of at any time. Incredible SteveO could not muster much more than a brisk walk, so why not just blow right by him? I do not know, maybe I am missing something. This flick had some of the feel of a Tales From The Crypt episode, but Tales usually had a cool or grotesque twist which often times you did not see coming. This was one picture that you could not quite get a handle on coming OR going. For example, in an early scene, you can clearly make out that Melting Mans eyeball fell out of his head, so how did he manage to get around for the rest of the story? I guess we are not supposed to ask.At eighty four minutes, this picture was about an hour and a half too long. When it was all over, I was ready to take up General Perry on his earlier suggestion  I could really use a drink about now.","label":0},{"index":5702,"txt":"No, just kidding. It was Godawful.I was watching my local Scifi station last night, which plays movies, every night, within a monthly theme. This month it is Space Turkeys, Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bombs. Movies so bad, they should never have been made. This was a good selection.Everything about this movie is thoroughly horrible with two exceptions, the gore makeup which showed potential and the editing which slightly out did the rest of the movie, in terms of being horrible. The acting is horrible all around, the dialog is horrible, the script, the direction. It is not a good movie.It consists of two forms of special effects, gore and stock footage of space. I will focus on the gore. Watching this movie, I thought to myself, What WAS the motivation behind the making of this movie? People like making stuff, sure, but I was hesitant to think anything good could have come of it for anyone involved. I came to the conclusion that this movie was made as a means to increase the Makeup Effects guys Demo Reel. He Rick Baker actually went on to a pretty nice career, he is worked on STAR WARS 1977, KING KONG 1976, MEN IN BLACK 1996, and even THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN 1981, plus a number of other notable flicks. Other than that, I cannot say I have ever actually SEEN a real, live melting man  incredible, or otherwise  but I would have to say this seemed to be a fair representation of one.Now, when I think of bad editing, I usually think of maybe a scene where someones talking on the phone and then, in the middle of the scene, the phone jumps down to his shoulder, or something to that effect. This movie really serves to highlighted the fact that bad editing can take many forms. Specifically, overlong and utterly useless scenes. Just about every scene dragged on longer than it should have, from a little bit of dead air to that crazylong screaming scene with Cleaver Girl. And that severed head in the river, the head gets thrown into a river in slow motion, the movie carries on for a couple minutes, and then we cut back to the floating head and watch it fall down a waterfall. While I am sure they were all very proud of their severed head, WHAT THE HELL??Lastly, I will mention the running fat ladyslow motion scene right near the beginning. The jerky slow motion tells me that they did not shoot the scene in slow motion originally but later decided that it was not working like that and then slowed it down. Oy vey. In any event, if you should ever see another movie in which a hysterical fat woman runs down a hall and then directly through a closed, glass door  all in slow motion, mind you  remember THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN, for this is where it all started.Movies like this are best viewed at home with a bunch of friends. This ones a little slow most of the time but that is just all the more time to come up with your own oneliners.

It appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie. Being the wise adults that they are, they told me Absolutely not! It is a bunch of trash. Of course, I was very disappointed that I would not be the first kid on my block to see the Incredible Melting Man.Little time passed  maybe a couple of days. I forgot about The Incredible Melting Man and my disappointment faded. Twentyfive years passed until it reentered the forefront of my thoughts. While surfing through channels on digital cable, I found this longlost relic of a movie. My curiosity was piqued and I decided to finally partake in this fruit forbidden by my parents. I should have listened to them. The Incredible Melting Man is perhaps the worst movie known to man. It makes movies such as DefCon 4, Metalstorm, and Freddie Got Fingered look like Oscar nominees. I feel violated for wasting almost two hours of my life watching this vile filth. The story was incoherent and the effects were crude even for 1977.

The continuity errors alone will have you angry  at least I was. The editing is really poor.Almost anything else you could possibly do would be better than spending time watching this movie.

The acting for the most part was also OK; though nothing special, it was of a higher quality than other BMovies I have seen in the past.The rest of this movie is dismally bad, The camera work often looks like they have just put the camera man on roller skates and pushed him along.

Unfortunately it is really draggy between these highlights. I decided to watch the last half of the movie while doing my tax return. That is how boring this film is.Nevertheless, if you love bad movies you will enjoy the dramatic exit of the Fat Nurse, and the stellar acting of the guy who plays Dr. Ted. To be fair to the poor man, he does have to deliver some amazingly inept lines with straight face  like the conversation he has with his wife on tracking down the I M ManI will find him with a geiger counter. Is he radioactive? Just a little bit. Yes, the plot has Dr. Ted wandering about trying to find a superstrong zombie killing machine armed only with what looks like a miniDyson. He is a brave man. Unfortunately his plan fails when he finds a big lot of goop on a tree. Oh god  it is his ear! says Dr. Ted to the audience. I am so glad he cleared that up. I realise I am making this movie sound rather fun. It would be if it were only 10 minutes long, but unfortunately it goes on and on, and the Incredible Melting Dude just dangles about making a sticky mess when he should be eating more people in my opinion.

The characters are uniformly unpleasant, and plot makes no sense.","label":0},{"index":5711,"txt":"I think that my favorite part of this movie, the one that exemplifies the sheer pointless, stupidity and inanity of the proceedings, comes at the climax of the film. DOCTOR TED NELSON and his unmarried friend the Sheriff have finally cornered the Melting Man on a landing on some stairs in an electrical generating plant. Keep in mind that Nelson has been looking for the MM for nearly the entire film, and that the MM has killed and eaten several people at this point including his boss, and Nelson is very aware that MM is violently insane and hungry for human flesh and blood.So the Sheriff has his gun pointed at MM, who is, and I give the movie and Rick Baker props for this, the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form that we have ever seen. And he yells a very important question to DOCTOR TED NELSON WHAT DO WE DO NOW?!?!? The camera cuts over to DOCTOR TED NELSON, and it is obvious that Ted has no idea what to do next. Apparently Ted was so intent on the problem of FINDING the Melting Man, he never thought to bring along some restraining devices, a lasso, or straitjacket, or a net, or some tranquilizer darts, or maybe a New Age tape by Vangelis to soothe the savage beast.So the sheriff panics and shoots, the Melting Man goes berserk, and hilarity ensues. Maybe this explains why NASA has been screwing around with the Space Shuttle program in sublunar space for the last 30 years instead of going back to the Moon or out to Mars like everyone knows they OUGHT to be doing. I dunno.Anyway, that is the kind of lousy, lazy writing and direction that undercuts every aspect of this movie. It is hard to say how good the actors actually are, because the movie has complete contempt for their characters.Two other incredibly painful sequences also ramp up the stupidity of the proceedings There is a scene featuring the lumpiest old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a grove, only to be torn apart by the Melting Man. This scene is a nadir in 70s cinema. I can guarantee you have never watched a more pointless and irritating setup with odder looking people in your entire life. And the Melting Mans assault on the lady who lives in the house where they keep a horse who pees on the walls defies every attempt to process it.BTW, I think famous film director Jonathon Demme has a walkon in this scene as the redneck husband who goes in first to check on the house and never comes out again. The only thing that keeps the actress from literally chewing the scenery is that, as I said, their horse has apparently been peeing on it. And we are forced to watch her hysterics for at least two minutes longer than any SANE film director would hold the shot. Burr DeBenning ought to beat the crap out of IMMs director and photographer. I remember him from an old Columbo episode where he looked MUCH better than he does here  no ones idea of a leading man, but solid and unobtrusive. But no one could possibly be as unappealing in real life as his director makes him look here. Everyone else comes off a little better except for the old couple and shut up, I know they were being played for laughs, but I as not laughing! but not much. This definitely falls into the So Bad You Cannot Look Away category of cinema disasters. Still, I would watch it again before I would watch a lot of other 70s and 80s abortions  Track of The Moonbeast and It Lives By Night come to mind, and MSTs coverage of it is great fun, so if you get a chance, watch the MST version.","label":0},{"index":5712,"txt":"Want to watch a scary horror film? Then steer clear of this one. There is not enough beer in the world to make this film enjoyable.However, there is enough scotch.

NASA sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit Saturn. A really big solar flare causes Colonel Steve West to bleed from the nose. Things go downhill from there, and wackiness ensues.I actually read the book adaptation, which was published and released only in the UK. MILES better than the film, and the book was dreadful. At least some pretense is made towards suspense, and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the authors rhymes with gas.Not to say that the film is completely without merit. Rick Baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film, and Jonathan Demme found that he is really better suited to direct.Yes, there is an MST3K episode featuring this flick, but it is, of course, edited quite a bit.

All he has to do is get a job as the Blob. The premise of this flick is pretty lame. An astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiationI think, and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day. Not only is this a puzzler, but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity. Huh? Have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens, the person instantly turns into a killing machine? Why is that?The astronaut lumbers off into the night from the secret facilitywhich has no security whatsoever, shedding parts of himself as he goes. Apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad, maybe because he wanted to return to space. Thus begins the part of the movie that is pretty much filler, with a doctor wandering around with a Geiger counter, trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off. He kills a stupid Bill Gates lookalike fisherman, scares a little girl a la the Frankenstein monster movie, and finishes off a wacky older couplepunishing them karmically for stealing some lemons. Then there is a short scene where he whacks his former General, and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around. You would think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away, the scene would shift. But no...we are treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror, even though the monster is gone.

There are various reasons for this. Firstly, Emma is too unpleasant. Yes, she has faults, and is not the easiest person to like  but the viewer should not downright start to despise her. Secondly, Mr Knightly is miscast. His brooding and melancholy in this version are better suited to a Bronte or Gaskell adaptation than Austen, and throw the mood of the whole affair off. Thirdly, Samantha Morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to the role of Harriet; and why was she made to look so sickly? Harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming  not to look as if she is going to be carried off by consumption in the next scene. Fourthly, the structure has been mucked up and scenes cut. At the end, when Emma decides she loves Mr Knightly, it comes across as utterly baffling because this narrative has not been adequately shown and carried along throughout the film. Fifthly, what was going on, exactly, with Mrs Eltons accent? She went from sounding like an American actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning, to all out American halfway through, and then back to English at the end. Finally, this dragged at the end. The book and the big film version end with the wedding of Emma and Mr Knightly.

Compared with the American Version with Guinneth Paltrow, the script was written to resemble as much as possible the book. But the acting was awful. Besides Kate Beckinsale, who I believe was a true likeness of the Emma in the book, all the other actors were trying too hard. Mark Strong was not the gentleman he was supposed to be. He was often rude and offensive, had no feeling whatsoever, and throughout the entire film you could not see his love growing for Emma at all. This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale, who seemed to be trying to resque her leading role as well as her partners. Moreover, there was no chemistry between the entire cast. Hariett Smith, played by Samantha Morton, seemed to have no real attachment to Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore, she did not seem as heartbroken as she was portrayed in the book. The settings of the film are also too poor. The costumes are even more so. I would have imagined Emma Woodhouse to dress in a more fashionable and elegant way that she does here. The ending is also too long. It is good that it resembles the books ending, but it is a killer ending for a film. And again, I can see no feeling of happiness in the face of Mr.Knightley. To conclude, I believed this adaptation to be loyal to the book, but with poor actors. It seemed as if the film was made without any budget at all. I would prefer to see the lighter version with Paltrow and Northam, even if it is clear that it was made to be a blockbuster, than to watch these actors excepting the good Olivia Williams and the better Kate Beckinsale ruin the entire script.","label":0},{"index":5725,"txt":"Emma is my favourite Jane Austen novel  Emma is wellmeaning despite her flaws, so readers can forgive and love her, and the relationship she has with Mr Knightley, which is warm, familiar, respectful but playful, generating that warm, fuzzy, romantic excitement.

Who does not want to be Emma? Who does not want to be told off by Mr Knightley? This version of Emma gives you no sense of the things that I love about Emma. I could not even finish watching it, I just found it so awful. I could not see that warm, generous side of Emma, which drives the reader to love her The patience and warmth she shows to her father; the closeness between her and Mrs Weston, which demonstrates her willingness to put her friends happiness above her own as she sacrifices the only equal companion in her household by forwarding Miss Taylors marriage. Mr Woodhouses character in this adaptation just appears bizarre, rather than just quaint, elderly and a bit trying.This adaptation most importantly fails bring to life the relationship between Mr Knightley and Emma. Their relationship is built on mutual respect and affection Mr Knightley is indulgent of Emmas minor faults trusting that her intelligence and genuine care for others will never allow her to go terribly astray; and Emma looks up to him, though playfully hiding this and continuing to use her own judgement. The dressing down he gives her right at the beginning of the show completely overstates the argument between them, and ruins all possibility of portraying the nature of their relationship as I have described above.

First, this is a rather gloomy film, and the last thing Emma should be is gloomy. More significantly, Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast. What planet, or minor work of Thomas Hardy, is this come from? It is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel.

Ultimately, we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities.

Meryl Streep as his gifted bride and Glenn Close, as her sister in law. When the camera stays with these folks, the movie tends to move, and is quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS engages with simply way too many subplots, and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets. We do not get to know them, hence we do not get to care for them. The result is boredom.

The acting was atrocious, but the story is what I really found appalling. The acting was wooden and stilted, even by early talkies standards the exceptions being Lee Tracy and HB Warner, neither of whom can do wrong. Rose Hobart was absolutely horrid and lifeless as Julie as she likewise was in 1932s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, an otherwise excellent flick. And the rest of the cast was worse, there being no words to describe their awfulness. Worse than the acting, however, was the story. For some unknown reason, Julie loves Liliom, a cad and user of women with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. He marries Julie but does not support her, instead lying in bed all day or hanging out with his lowlife criminal pal Lee Tracy. And, oh yeah, he never has a kind word to say to Julie and he regularly beats her. Julie loves him nonetheless and continually makes excuses for him, which only seems to make him more abusive. What is even sicker is that this movie presents this story to us as a love story. Somehow we are supposed to see Julie as a noble character whose pure love redeems Liliom. WTF? The last 13 of this movie takes place after Liliom has killed himself a robbery plot goes awry and Liliom plunges a knife into himself rather than being taken in by the police. As he lay dying, he tells Julie I beat you all the time, but I am not sorry for it. When he at last dies, she finally tells him she loves him. Neither character ever said I love you to the other while they were alive. After his death, Gods Chief Magistrate gives Liliom one more day on earth so that he can do something good for his unborn daughter. The price for this is 10 years in hell. After 10 years, Liliom is allowed one day on earth to see his now 10yrold daughter. He approaches her in the front yard of her home and tries to cajole her into letting him do something good for her; he tries to get her to play cards, he tries to give her Gabriels horn, but she is not interested and rebuffs him. So he slaps her. He. Slaps. Her. And then he disappears back to the afterlife. Looking on, we see his daughter tell Julie about this. The girl says the slap did not hurt, that it felt like a kiss. This is supposed to be the movies magical moment. The girl asks her mother if such a thing is possible, and Julie replies that someone can be beat you and beat you and beat you and not hurt you at all. Then the music swells and Liliom rides up to heaven in the celestial train. BLECH! There was one saving grace to this film, and that is the interview between the Chief Magistrate HB Warner was truly magnificent here and Liliom on the celestial train. The Magistrate had some very profound things to say to Liliom about life and second chances and death. This scene alone made me bump this rating from 1 to 2 stars. Regarding Lilioms suicide as a means for escaping his problems, the Magistrate says People suppose that when they die, their difficulties are ended for them. You thought that by killing yourself that you would cancel all your responsibilities. It is not as simple as that. On Earth your name is still spoken; your face is still remembered. As long as one is left who remembers you, so long is the matter unended. Until you have been completely forgotten, you will not be finished with the Earth, even though you are dead.

He winds up dead the very same night Cristina kills her DEAD father in a nightmare. Screaming mad on the street, Cristina does indeed have blood on her which leads police detective Eli Wallach and partner Christopher Walken to investigate them with sure certainty that it all somehow leads back to Sarandon who is a hotshot lawyer who once beat the cop in court regarding the whole wifes suicide. That case is really a motivating factor is Wallachs dogged approach to finding out whose blood was really on Cristina and if Sarandon has anything to do with it. You also have Martin Balsam as a professor who understands this type of Latin Cristina mysteriously understands and unbilled actors such as Jeff Goldblum as a fashion photographer and Tom Berenger as a man interested in this certain room that has become available in the very roomnow renovatedthat Cristina once stayed in! What bothers me more than anything is lack of explanation. Towards the end of the film Wallach and Walken are forgotten and we are left wondering why they just up and quit investigating. Their characters are just left on the backburner.

Burke has unwittingly unleashed a deadly evil force which is in the mood for some killing  noone is safe...Directed by Renny Harlin I thought Prison was a poor late 80s horror flick that seemed to forget about the small point of having a story. The script was by Empire Pictures regular C. Courtney Joyner who was responsible for writing such classics as Class of 1999 1990, Puppet Master III Toulons Revenge 1991  Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys 2004 amongst other low budget horror crap that even I have not heard of  seems to take itself very seriously. The biggest problems I have with Prison are that it is far too slow, it is over 30 minutes into the film before the evil force is even released although the pace does pick up towards the end but by then it was too little too late as far as I was concerned, then there is the fact there is no discernible storyline here at all. For a start it never tries to explain why there is an evil force bricked up in the old execution chamber, it never explains why this force decides to kill random inmates when it is supposed to be out on a revenge mission or why it just does not kill Warden Sharpe straight away, no explanation is given to where Burke fits into it even though he looks exactly the same as the prisoner who was electrocuted  has come back, there is no real explanation as to how the Warden is connected to everything that is going on apart from two early nightmare sequences in which he seems to be remembering something although it is never revealed what it is or why. To be honest I could not really give you a plot synopsis as the film does not have a rigid story which it follows all the way through. The characters are dull  forgettable, the murders are few  far between, the pacing is way off, the whole film is a mess  even ghosts cannot shoot straight when it comes to trying to shoot the hero. A less than satisfactory way to spend 100 odd minutes, there really are better things you could be doing.Director Harlins full American flick debut he does a good job  there is a decent atmosphere but after over an hour of constant drab, dull, dark prison cells  corridors I started to get bored. I just think the look of the film is far too repetitive, bland  frankly lifeless. I did not think it was scary  the gore is pretty tame apart from the best moment in the entire film when a police guard gets killed when a load of barb wire wraps itself around his body  face with a nice close up of his throat being torn open. Other than that there is a burnt corpse  a mangled body which falls from the ceiling  very little else. There is a scene when the Warden burns all the prisoner mattresses in front of them  then makes them stand all night in their underwear in the yard, I was watching this scene  thought that you would never get away with doing something like that. Over here prisoners have rights  if the Warden did something like that there would be a national outcry from all those humanitarians  every prisoner would sue the Warden, the prison service  the Government for everything they had  they would win!With a supposed budget of about 4,000,000 Prison actually had a pretty healthy budget although it does not really look like it on screen, sure there is a decent cast  the few special effects that are included are good but overall it is set in the same location with limited ambition. Prison was actually shot in a real Wyoming state prison so it certainly looks the business. The acting is alright, Prison proves that sometimes Hollywood stars not only have one crap horror film skeleton in their closets but in the case of Mortensen he has two with this  the awful The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1994 both of which I am sure he would like to forget about...Prison is a dull, lifeless, colourless  humourless waste of 100 minutes, despite one good gore scene I did not like it at all as I actually prefer my films to have a story rather than seemingly random events  incidents cobbled together with no narrative sense.","label":0},{"index":5757,"txt":"This solid little horror film is actually one of Renny Harlins best.

Dr. Sands was visiting a night club and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded customer and was assisted by Angelina Jolie,Claire,Taking Lives,04, who immediately becomes attracted to Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton,Raymond Blossom,Kinsey,04, plays the Big Shot Gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections. Timothy Hutton seems to over act in most of the scenes and goes completely out of his mind trying to keep his gang members from being killed. Gary Dourdan,Yates,CSIVegas TV Series, plays a great supporting role and portrays a real COOL DUDE who is a socalled body guard for Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby red lips which draws a great deal of attention from all the men. This film is not the greatest, but it does entertain.","label":0},{"index":5760,"txt":"Cool idea... botched writing, botched directing, botched editing, botched acting.

This is really the only reason I could leave the television on  morbid fascination. It was not so much the acting, which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect from this cast, but the premise and the plot which never should have seen the light of day. The script, too, is groaninducing. As for cinematography, did anyone else notice that they used a curtains drawing segue device, like in an old 50s TV show...but without irony? At first I thought they must be kidding but the movie takes itself too seriously to have used this in a tongueincheek manner. Do not even ask me about the score...the only high point is the final song, by Morcheeba. I guess they wanted to leave people with something for their 8...glad I saw it on TV!!!!! Just silly!

Nine years later he is almost forgotten, and his tentatives to make it on the big screen failed miserably. I cannot even explain why, he is a fair actor, but probably his moment of fame cast him in a eternal role that takes big talent to break from.At the same time Angelina Jolie was much less known, and she was really lucky that a film like Playing God did not led her career into a deadend. Fortunately for her, The Bone Collector and Girl, Interrupted were waiting beyond the corner, and when Lara Croft came, her career was launched.There is not too much to be told about this film. It is the only big screen film of Andy Wilson, and there must be a reason. All is banal and most of what happens on the screen expected in this story of an exdoctor who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar only to find himself working for the mob.

There is nothing more uninteresting than a mediocre movie, and My Name is Modesty Whatever the subtitle is takes mediocrity to a new level. It is full of Bactors but is not any fun whatsoever because it takes itself seriously. It sets itself up as a thriller but then turns into some kind of growingup drama, flashback style. The beautiful Alexandra Staden, smothered beyond recognition under makeup, more resembles a cast member from Top Model than Modesty Blaise. I am not one of those diehard comic book freaks who wants every adaptation of his precious graphic novels to be pitchperfect  in fact I have never even read Modesty Blaise  all I wanted was a decent movie to watch. But this was not it. The film feels halffinished, with a weak and very unexciting conclusion to a rather weak plot. It also takes its audience for idiots, explaining every tiny detail of the plot to us and showing flashbacks of things that happened three scenes ago I guess they think we all have Alzheimers.Now I love a good Bmovie  what is better than just turning your brain off and swallowing the cinematic equivalent of a Calzone?  and Modesty is directed by none other than Scott Spiegel, who brought us the wonderful splatter crap flick From Dusk Till Dawn 2 Texas Blood Money! I loved From Dusk Till Dawn 2 because it brought everything a bad Bmovie should bring to the table  nudity, gore, guns, you name it. Modesty is just dull. The flashback concerning Modestys life is not interesting. The acting is not bad enough to be laughed at. In fact, I kinda liked Nikolaj CoasterWaldaus hey buddy, pseudonyms are your friends! performance as the baddie.So overall it is just lame. Weak. Uninspired. Call it what you will. Do not watch anything because Tarantino presents it, people. This is just a very forgettable, halfhearted thriller, and it never tries to be more than that.

It describes an incident in which the young Modesty 17 in the book, mid twenties in the filmasserts her leadership in a war over a casino. As this is set before the actual Blaise adventures her trusted sidekick Willi Garvin is not in the film. That is one of the main problems as the relationship between Blaise and Garvin was certainly always one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and the long running comic strip. The other problem is that the film is quite simply incredibly boring because it really is just one small episode blown up into a screenplay. The casting is okay but Alexandra Staden is not really convincing as the heroine and actually too old for the role to play the young Modesty.

It is not that the movie is terrible, it is just not what I was expecting or hoping for. While I have been aware of the Modesty Blaise character for years, I am not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels, so I am coming into this movie as something as an outsider. That may be part of the reason for my disappointment. I was expecting more action and more comedy. The film is dialogue driven. I suppose I was looking for something with a little more camp value. As it is, My Name is Modesty is a deathly serious film. There are very few, if any, light moments. The acting, at least from Alexandra Staden, is acceptable but nothing outstanding. As others have commented, she does appear a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role. What action scenes there are in My Name is Modesty are one of the films weakest points. I never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers.I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the Modesty Blaise character.

Although not being a great fan of Quentin Tarantino I anyway was interested to hear a few years back that he was considering making a film of her could he finally give Modesty a nice big screen treatment she is worthy of? I heard of My Name Is Modesty a few months ago and checked the stars it had been given here, and was not too surprised to find out the score was not too high, since beloved characters often have hard time melting the fans heart if not done exactly right. So I decided not to read any reviews and see the film instead, and well, I just finished watching it, and I am stunned, and sad, and yeah, pretty furious, too. Sad and furious of giving over an hour of my time seeing something so fabulous as Modesty Blaisecharacter being turned into a film that has nothing to give to a viewer or a fan.It seems that almost everything about this film is subpar and unprofessional, although I must admit seeing some actors in other films earlier where they were fine so I cannot blame them. But the screenplay and the directing... my god, why even make this kind of crap with production values slightly bigger than your average TVfilm but done much worse? I do not know the background of this film and actually I really do not want to know, but I just cannot help wondering that how on earth could Tarantino with a straight face tell that he loves Modesty and then put his name on this? He just lost a huge amount of respect in my eyes. The director was not the right man for this job and I can honestly thank him for ruining my night.I give this film 3 stars and those stars go to the actors and the technical quality which could have been worse. The other seven stars missing are what this film was not good at.

Its like a Mission Impossible movie would be about Ethan Hunt locked in the detention room in high school talking with the janitor about when he went to junior high school and Hunt would have been played by DJ Qualls in Road Trip. Soo if you are an Modesty fan do not see the movie you will just get angry.

It is 75 a rehash of The Boogeyman, and would have been banned for the same reason  whatever that was.I was initially confused as I thought that Annie Kelly Galindo may have been a different Lacey, but she was someone trouble by psychic visions of a boogeyman similar to the one in the first film.

Of course, we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered.Then the movie shift to a rerunning of The Boogeyman story with some extra footage that we did not see in the original. Notably, the boogeyman is shown unlike the original. Sadly, some of the good scenes were cut, but 90 of it is there. Why rerun this film? Did they find the footage in the trash? What was the purpose?

So after watching the trailer for Water Lilies, I expected to like this film because I thought I would stumbled on something unique a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love  sort of a female version of Beautiful Thing. The main characters are young French women 15 years old. Marie is slender, reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way; Floriane is outgoing, athletic and beautiful; and Anne is loyal, pudgy and behaviorally immature. The erotic interrelationship between Marie and Floriane is always simmering in this movie, if not at the surface, then just below it. Water Lilies, however, is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens; it is about sexual frustration, suffering, ennui, teens working at crosspurposes and  in at least two instances  joyless, mechanical sex. It also proves that screenwriters and filmmakers mar their own creations when they become too manipulative.In the extra features on the Lord of the Flies DVD, director Peter Brook says, French cynicism starts with the arousal of sex, meaning the French regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism. Part of the downfall of this film is filmmaker Celine Sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicism.Where is the joy? I asked myself while watching this film. Yes, first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh, lifeaffirming way. These positive aspects are missing from this movie; there is no balance.Organically, this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love. But Sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film. First, what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude? I know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in European cinema, as evidenced by films like The Slingshot; The Rascals; The Devil, Probably; The Little Thief; Murmur of the Heart; Friends; Beau Pere and Europa, Europa; but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion  See, audience, I can make a film where I show only the unattractive person nude. Either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity would have been an honest way to go.There is a scene in a club where Floriane and Marie are dancing. What follows next is not just Floriane cynically manipulating Marie; it is filmmaker Sciamma cynically manipulating her audience.Perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when Floriane warns Marie she is about to request something that is not normal. Marie understandably asks, Who cares about being normal? Then Sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie, because Florianes request is a phony, derivative and substitute question  not the authentic, heartfelt question the movie, Maries character and the viewers who have invested their time deserve. Here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewers nerves 1 Since when do the French  of all people  take baths wearing bathing suits, and with a turtle to boot? 2 What teen  of any nationality  would chomp down on an apple core that is been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloveds mouth?The three main actresses are promising and, if they find better vehicles for their talents, may become excellent actors. Louise Blachere Anne is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles. Adele Haenel Floriane could become a leading lady, or a bombshell, or both. Pauline Acquart Marie possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable. In the future, she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaim.All in all, Water Lilies was very disappointing. Will an honest filmmaker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love! No  not necessarily for the sake of this middleaged guy  but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with.

Now II left the door open for another sequel, and I for one would not have minded seeing at least one more. One day while I was browsing though the videos at a store in the mall I came across a film entitled Return of the Boogey Man. When I found out it was a sequel to the earlier films I was happy to shell out a few bucks for it...I should have known better. Though the opening title is Boogey Man 3, this is no sequel to those two far superior films I named above. Well, not totally anyway.Pros Ha! That is a laugh. Is there anything good about this hunk of cow dung? Let us see...it has footage from The Boogey Man and, um...it is mercifully short. Yeah, that is about it.Cons Where to start? Decisions, decisions. First of all, this movie is a total bore. It goes from one scene to the next without anything remotely interesting or scary happening. The acting is stiff at best. The actors are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before, and probably none since. The plot is nonexistent and script shoddily written. The direction is just plain awful. The director tries to make the film look all artsy fartsy by making the camera move around, lights flicker, and with filters, but it adds nothing. The music is dull and hard to hear in parts. Ties to the original are botched. Suzanna Loves character was named Lacey, not Natalie! And the events depicted in the beginning of the original did not take place in 1978. Also, if this has a 3 in the title, why is there no mention of what happened in II? Finally, this adds nothing new or interesting to either the series or the genre.Final thoughts The people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves. It is one thing if that had been an original film that was the directors first and sucked. But instead it is supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece, but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this. If there ever is another sequel, which I doubt it, then it needs to forget this one ever happened and be handled either by Lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea of how to make a decent horror film.My rating 15","label":0},{"index":5779,"txt":"Return of the Boogyman is a dreadful movie which does not play like a movie, it plays like an episode of a TV sitcom when they flashback to older episodes.

Firstly, cheap and lifeless new footage. Secondly, LOADS of recycled bits from the first movie.

I do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon, donned in their late 70sstyle wide collars, bellbottoms and feathered hair, I knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster.The first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning, trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe, forcing polyester and pornoquality music on the wouldbe viewer. From the opening scene with the poorlydone effects to the monsters from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of The Vagina Monologues.Throughout the film, the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear. The ship was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old VCR and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path. Of course if moved slower than Bob Barkers impacted bowels, but it had menacing pencilthin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two with some assistance.Moving on... As the weirdness and bell bottoms continue... We found out that they are caught in a Space Time Warp. How do we garner this little nugget of scientific information? Because the oldest male lead tells his son that, in a more or less offthecuff fashion, like reminiscing about how you won the big game over a cup of joe or an icecold bottle of refreshing CocaCola.

Many of the characters are woefully miscast, particularly the ever overrated Colin Friels.Very little works in this pretentious garbage. Much of the character development is done through a silly, angstridden voice over and frequently completely contradicts the behaviour of characters onscreen. In fact, it is hard to even figure out who the voice overs are talking about because they describe such different characters to who we see on screen! How are we meant to know Colin Friels Javo is meant to be an erratic, violent and unreliable junkie? One of these silly voice overs tells us. For crying out loud, the nature of his character is half the point of the movie and the only thing that lets us know is a flippin voice over! The real killer is the characters. Everything about them. Their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the rack, despite the fact we are constantly reminded they are meant to be artsy paupers. They are all absurdly wellspoken for junkies. None seem to have any real comprehension of life on the skids or on smack and yet this is meant to be the case with most of them.Monkey Grip deserves no more attention than a weekday TV movie matin\u00e9e.

Her acting is over the top, even for a silent film. Her acting is more like what one would expect in a film from the early teens, not the late 20s. She usually has the same face, which reminds me sorry to say of someone with constipation pains. It was also very difficult to believe that any man would fall for this femme fatale. There was nothing charming about her at all.The film was also quite long drawn, the camera work was uninteresting aside from a shot of a horse race and the editing was dull.

And, although a bit slow at times, the first 90 of the movie is quite good, with more than a few old time scares that make one jumpy and unsettled. I actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes. Where Dark Remains fails, however, is in its climax. The ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be MILES APART from its body. The storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and, the answer I was seeking most  what REALLY happened to Emma?  was not elucidated upon! The rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best, and in the end, I felt very cheated.

Even if the movie is not necessarily bad its definitely below average. Dark Remains is basically a Ghost Movie with a premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions haunting you. The movie starts off already with 2 stories loosely interwebbed which even later are not tied together. A couple loses its child which is found slashed in its bed. They move to a country house to flee their past and guess what... the house is haunted, kind of. From here on Dark Remains starts off very slow with some scary moments indeed The first ghost appearances are nice and the flashlight sequence also worked very good. OK, then... Woman sees ghost of daughter, other ghosts of people died in accidents or suicides appear, man tries to solve secret of houses past, woman gets depressed, strange neighbors appear. Its pretty much all been there, but the premise of it being their own emotions is nice, so you wait for the twist. There is no twist, you are just confused by a haunted house history story, the strange neighbor, a totally pointless creepy prison and the dead daughter thrown together with a photoidea reminding me a lot of The shutter. The end is ridiculous because when you start and end a movie this slow and with piano music its pretty lame to include some hoards of ghosts at once which look like a zombie flick, of course just to return to slow pacing and piano music. To make it short... Dark Remains could have been a nice scary ghost story if the script was not trying to go everywhere and arriving nowhere.Too many stories mushed together which just do not make any sense and contradict in the basic atmosphere of the movie. And beside... please never use abandoned prisons again. Its so worn off and in this case it even makes no sense at all. Hey, there is this creepy prison uphill, lets shoot there.

First, a woman commits suicide by slashing her wrists whilst bathing. Second, the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat slashed. The grieving couple decide to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains. It later transpires that the cabin and surrounding locations are haunted.As the movie goes on, the 2 separate strands of story eventually converge as one might reasonably expect. However, the execution is haphazard and results in confusion that could perhaps only be resolved by multiple viewings. Unfortunately, the movie is simply not enticing enough to attract most viewers into watching it more than once.Just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong  and fast! And the low budget cannot be used to justify all of the shortcomings found here.I believe it would be wrong to pass judgement on the actors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor.The characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site. The badly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for characterdriven situations and without adding depth to any of them.The direction is uninspired. The inspiration from JHorror movies such as RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is evident. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS did not pay close attention to the style of JHorror. JHorror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown. Tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation a ghost on a CCTV camera walking towards it for example, and the reaction of a central character who is faced with it without any warning. There is no humour or tongueincheek element in these movies. Everything is played so straight and without remorse or limitations that you cannot help but be convinced and captivated by it. The foreboding atmospheres set up the suspense and ensures the horror has psychological impact, very much unlike the jump scares used in Hollywood movies.The directors of DARK REMAINS made a brave attempt to avoid Hollywood clich\u00e9s and also successfully avoided using CGI. The homage to JHorror could have been well intended. Unfortunately, the lack of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed scares on the screen. The makeup effects of the ghosts were not too bad given the low budget but their actions just defied logic. I was scratching my head quite a few times during this movie.I could not give away the ending even if I wanted to. I simply could not understand it. All I could deduce was that it was something of an anticlimax.What remains? The answer as a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom. The movie is a chore to sit through. Thankfully, the pain ends after an hour and a half. However, most would probably switch off long before the end.There are only 2 positive things I could find in this movie  the successful avoidance of scare clich\u00e9s and the absence of the fword in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find. This is what the 2 stars are for.Those who like supernatural or psychological horror relating to ghosts and haunting might do well to stick to movies such as THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING or the JHorror subgenre.If you think you have seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure ultralow budget Rrated horror movie about ghosts, watch DEATH OF A GHOST HUNTER. It may not be the greatest horror movie ever made but it is surely a lot better than DARK REMAINS and does have a few genuine surprises in store.I advise everyone to avoid DARK REMAINS like the plague.","label":0},{"index":5796,"txt":"If you have ever seen a movie by Brian AvenetBradley and compares it to the feedbacks it gets on IMDb, you know that most of the comments and votes are faked.

The story was a clich\u00e9 and poorly scripted. The special effects were minimal. The suspense tricks employed repetitively here were hard to swallow.To be fair, Dark Remains is no worse than quite some of the Masters of Horrors episodes.

Julie remains in a zombie state, eliciting next to no emotion, remote and numb, only photographing a nearby abandoned prison, finding a startling image of a ghoul girl clinging to the bars of a cell. Though Allen does not see anything out of the ordinary, Julie continues to take pictures and we can recognize that something is not quite right. A local handyman, Jim PayneScott Hodges, a rather distant fellow who harbors a secret becomes a dangerous threat when it is revealed that his dead mother might have something to do with the haunts occurring to the Pykes. Meanwhile the neighbors who sold the Pykes the cabin find themselves victims as well, alcoholic Mr Booths abuse to his wife coming back to haunt him. Allen will conduct an investigation into the history of his cabin, attempting to unravel the mystery about the place.Plenty of ghosts moving about in the background in this somber supernatural tale with practically every character miserable. Cheri Christian remains so vacuous and lost, it is incredibly hard to connect with her despite the fact that you understand her plight. The acting, as is often mentioned, remains frustrating because none of the characters exactly are easy to latch on to. I guess it is supposed to be this way, under their circumstances, but the trouble I had was never being able to properly embrace the Pykes due to their constant state of aloofness. Cheri comes off as cold and detached, as I figure a mother would tend to be when you lose a child in such a way, but the icy nature left me pleading inside to embrace her which I just never could. I think the right performers, even if the characters are going through an emotional turmoil, can grab the hearts of their viewers, if a humanity reaches out to us..in this movies case, the leads are unable to do so, for whatever reason. It could have been me, I do not know. I wanted to care for them, but nothing in the characters tugged on my heart strings. Anyway, as the film continues, Allen slowly uncovers certain truths and must defend himself against his wife who has convinced herself that their daughter is among them and she will not lose her little girl again. Jim, the unstable neighbor who believes that to stop the hauntings plaguing the area he must kill the Pykes, becomes a vital threat. The ghosts remain a central part of the movie, their presence, particularly Jims mother, established throughout, off in the distance. The finale reveals all of them as Allen must find help for his wife while trying to thwart Jims mission.

It is good fun for teenagers, but I think adults will not find much to go on.When In Rome does have its good points. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually quite decent actresses, certainly very pretty as well. I will admit when I was 10 or so, I really liked them, and in general I kind of like them still. And I have enjoyed some of their movies like Passport To Paris and New York Minute. Back on target, both girls do not do that bad a job, in fact they are very appealing. Plus their outfits are to die for, and the scenery of Rome is absolutely breathtaking. The soundtrack as not half bad either.However, where the film is brought down is in the plot and the script. The script is on the most part clich\u00e9d and has hints of deja vu. The plot, like most of the Mary Kate and Ashley movies, is very predictable, and anyone familiar with any other of the Olsen twins work, will find some rather unoriginal elements to it. Most of the characters are cardboard thin, and you do not learn very much about them, and sometimes the pace is uneven. Sadly, the breathtaking scenery is spoilt by rather slapdash camera work, that looked rushed constantly.All in all, does have its good points, and certainly watchable.

I think it is a blessing that more and more people are choosing to critically examine fundamental aspects of our daily lives; the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies. However, just because Lee is making contentious films does not make him a good filmmaker.What comes across in Jungle Fever is a superficial understanding of these sociopolitical forces. This is largely the result of two main failuresfirstly, Lee is simply trying too hard. He seems to be desperately trying to accommodate every politicalsocial statement he can think of into the 90mins. And as such, the end result seems confused and irresolute as he allows himself no time to develop characters that can fully embody the ideas he hopes to present. And so he exhausts stereotypes and we are left with rushed testimonies and very loaded dialogs. The end result is very staged and unrealistic.Secondly, by attempting to make statements about such a wide variety of societal functions, he appears to have no concrete or original interpretation of the socialpolitical issues presented. What comes across is a puddle of regurgitated nonsense. You feel that he bought an elementary level sociology text book and spewed out all 500 pages.These are highly problematic features because the artistry of film is sacrificed and the work is transformed into a loudspeaker for the voice of the voice of the filmmaker. He is unable to distance himself from the work, and allow it to speak for itself.It functions neither as a piece of art nor a sound political argument.Although I still do appreciate Lee bringing up these important issues, I must sayTwo thumbs down.","label":0},{"index":5819,"txt":"Who in their right mind plays a lyrical song at the same time they are portraying an emotional scene between two people?

The scenes of Annabella getting beaten by her father with his fists, a lamp and then a belt was so cartoonish as to be absurd. This entire movie is a cartoon, the rampant prejudice against whites is literally astounding. The discussion by the black women after flippers wife finds out he has cheated on her with a white woman  as if it were a discussion by an oxford debating team, is ridiculous. The rampant racism might be possible to endure, but the soundtrack and the sound mixing during this movie is too much. It was a technically poorly made movie.

Scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes, play as if some college kid wrote this. I especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up Snipes. The overacting of the leads makes one feel as if Spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about. The final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in. This movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the Fword in casual conversation. I am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker. I think his union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move.

The kind that might make datemovie styled horror fans occasionally jump in their seat and scream in your ear, but disappoint audiences searching for a little depth and direction.John Cusak plays a writer who is made a career of writing books describing his experiences of staying in rumored haunted hotels. Despite assurances by patrons and owners that ghosts roam the halls, there is little to make him a real believer in the paranormal. When he learns of the history of Room 1408 at the Overlook Hotelno wait, I mean, Dolphin Hotel in New York Cityhe decides it would make the perfect closing chapter to his latest book. But, Samuel L. Jackson, playing the hotel owner, strongly attempts to dissuade his guest with narration of the atrocities that have occurred in theat room since the hotels opening many years ago. The story is simple and we, as possible skeptics, must sit through Jacksons lengthy foreshadowing ramble. In other words be afraid! Be very afraid!Of course, it would be easy to convince audiences that they have just paid to see an edgeoftheseat thriller if it did not take so long to build up to this point. And also, if what followed was a lot more than cheap boos that become so frequent and arbitrary that eventually, you might soon expect them. The temperature in the room changes automatically. The walls drip with blood. The fearless writer cannot open the door, etc. And after nearly an hour and a half of delivering these to audiences promised big thrills, you might sit and hope that at least you can be wowed by the ending. With suspicions of dream sequences and other derivative timewasters, even that fails to quell our doubts that before the movie is over, we might finally have something to make the movie a little less than completely forgettable.Despite grand performances as always by Cusak, who essentially is the entire film, most everyone else of note is wasted i.e. Samuel L.

The answer not much, just John Cusack having a long, drawnout, mental breakdown.Maybe if the Cusack character had more depth . . maybe if his freakout were a more thorough reworking of his everyday life . . . maybe if the film had either better developed its halfbaked themes about loss and faith or had not tacked them on in the first place . . . maybe if the film had made a choice to be either psychological horror or thrillride horror and had fully embraced one of these styles . . .

The subtleness is quickly replaced by the predictable shotgun approach... Just blast the audience with every Hollywood scary trick in the book and hope that something works. Let us see, a clock radio that turns on by itself? Good, that is always scary. Objects that move around in the room? Good, you cannot complain about that. Blood dripping from the walls and sink? Great. Ghosts that commit suicide? Good. Anything else? How about loud noises, shaking, fire, more shaking, messing up the room, more blood, etc etc. It is all good. And it is all been done before.

I was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is, unfortunately, the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring, despite how much Jim Creegan was digging himself.

BNL was a cult phenomenon in Canada, and much of their humour has a particular Canadian slant to it Kraft Dinner is a staple for many students up here, and the name Gordon is quintessentially Canadian a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and I was somewhat gratefull.

Can he not insinuate himself on the Australian police? It seems like a very artificial plot point to get him involved in a crime investigation.The latter episodes of the original series were pretty melodramatic and implausible, sometimes bordering on silliness, and this one picks up that mantle rather than returning to the focus of series one. Sad.","label":0},{"index":5837,"txt":"A major disappointment. This was one of the best UK crime drama  detective shows from the 90s which developed the fascinating title character played by Scotlands Robbie Coltrane. However this oneoff has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectations when a favored show returns after a long hiatus. Coltrane is not really given much to do, much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer, and in what he has to act in, he seems uninvolved, almost bored. The exsoldiers story is written by the books and the attempt to update us on Coltranes family life seems lightweight. Perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one twohour show they would have written this with much more depth. As is, skip this and watch the old Cracker from the 90s which is far far superior.","label":0},{"index":5838,"txt":"As a huge fan or the Cracker series, I have been waiting 7 years for the next addition. This Episode I am afraid just does not live up to the legend.Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years for his daughters wedding and gets involved in a murder investigation were a soldier, tormented by flash backs from his tour of duty in Northern Irland, goes on a killing spree.What I did not like about this episode is the extremely convenient way it is all set up and how fitz is led to the murderer. It is all fat to farfetched.There are however some good scenes in flash backs from Northern Irland which are filmed great.","label":0},{"index":5839,"txt":"I am a true fan of the original Cracker series, and own all of them on DVD. Cracker had a tendency to be overthetop on occasion, but Robbie Coltrane and the other cast members, as well as the writers, always seemed to carry it off despite themselves. I count the original Cracker among the great Brit TV crime series of that time, and there is some stiff competition Prime Suspect, Inspector Frost, Inspector Morse, Jeremy Bretts Sherlock Homes, and a host of others. Cracker, along with Prime Suspect, was on the top of my list.Which makes A New Terror all the more sad...Ultimately, this was a very pale imitation of Crackers former glory. I forced myself to sit through the whole thing, convinced that it could not actually be this bad, and that some spark would eventually ignite. I was wrong, it was bad from beginning to end.A few criticisms First, just to get any potential bias upfront right off I was offended by the antiAmerican, antiwar screed that droned on and on throughout most of the show. The topper the murder of two Americans innocent of any crime and a British Junkie is, in Fitzs words, understandable, but not justified. I thought I waded through two hours of crap just to hear this disgusting bit of drivel? So I had a negative reaction to the antiwarAmerican tone brought on by my beliefs... Beyond the politics, I had the distinct sense that this Cracker was merely a prop for the propaganda, and it actually helped to undermine an already terribly weak script.Second, just how much airtime did Robbie Coltrane get? Fitz was almost a bit player in this one, as if he was an afterthought plugged into some story originally written without any thought of Fitzs role. Coltrane could have carried the show on his own broad and still suitably flabby shoulders, but the writer was apparently thinking of other things, and missed the chance, and by a wide margin.Third WHAT AN ABYSMAL SCRIPT! There was some sparkle, and a couple of bits of actual character development Fitzs son ranting that Fitz could not stay at his house if he missed his plane to Australia, the Detective that liked to beat his poorperformers over the backs of their heads, and some of the old sparks between Fitz and his Missus but not nearly enough to carry the tedious storyline. Fourth, where the hell was Panhallagan? Now that would have been interesting... It was Manchester after all, and 10 years on she would be up in the ranks. Another wasted opportunity or perhaps the actress was not interested? Well, there is much more that is bad to say , but I will close with a curiosity at the end of the show as it aired on BBCA, when the advertisement announced that the Directors Cut was available on BBC OnDemand, I thought AHHA! The Directors cut, which, presumably, one has to pay for, might have all of the goodies I expected to see tonight but never did, like a coherent, interesting storyline. Unfortunately, after convincing myself to sit through the horrible free version of A New Terror with the hope of seeing something, anything, worth watching, only to be disappointed, I have no hope left to motivate me to actually pay for a second, potentially longer and more tedious version. Besides, it angered me to think that BBCA sliced and diced, and sacrificed show time to accommodate the endless every ten minutes or so stream of commercials, and then turned around and asked me to pay for what probably should have been version aired tonight.To close, I quote the first paragraph of Varietys review of A New Terror it really says it all Initial excitement about Robbie Coltrane reprising his role as the BBCs flawed, boozing, womanizing criminal psychologist is snowed under by the heavyhanded political statement writer Jimmy McGovern is determined to deliver within this revival vidpic. Jolting at first in its message  namely, that Americans are a bunch of whiny nambypambies who did not care a whit about terrorism before it came crashing onto our doorstep  McGoverns chestclearing rant overwhelms the narrative and mutes the pleasure of seeing Fitz back on the case.","label":0},{"index":5840,"txt":"For those of you who have never heard of it or seen it on AE, Cracker is a brilliant British TV show about an overweight, chainsmoking, foulmouthed psychologist named Fitz who helps the Manchester police department get into the heads of violent criminals. It is considered to be one of the finest shows ever to come out of England and that is saying something, and was tremendously successful in England and around the world back in 1993.Now, the original stars have reteamed with the original writer to knock out one more 2hour episode. I have loved this show ever since I would first seen it, over a decade ago. The DVD box set holds a place of honor in my collection, and I can quote a good deal of Fitzs interrogation scenes practically word for word. The idea of Robbie Coltrane reteaming with Jimmy McGovern for another TV movie about Fitz filled me with absolute glee.I will start with the good. One of the many things that impressed me about the original Cracker series was how quickly Fitz was defined as a character. Five minutes into the first episode \u0096 with his lecture throwing the books into the air, his drinking, and his cussing of the guy after him on the gambling machine queue \u0096 and you knew, simply knew, who this character was. You could feel him clicking in your mind, the kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writer.Coltrane, of course, remained great throughout the show, but I always felt that some of the later episodes \u0096 those not written by McGovern \u0096 mistreated the character.So the good news is this Fitz is back. As soon as you see him in this show \u0096 making incredibly inappropriate comments at his daughters wedding \u0096 you will feel that click once again. It is him petulant one moment and truly sorry the next, always insightful, sincere to the point of tactlessness but brilliantly funny in the process. If you love this character as much as I do, you will be delighted with how he is portrayed in the movie. And this extends to Judith and Mark in fact, everything having to do with the Fitzs is handled perfectly.The problem I do have with this movie revolves around the crime Fitz is trying to solve. In standard Cracker fashion, we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes \u0096 the suspense lies in seeing Fitz figure it out. In this case, we have a serial killer who is out for American blood. And the reason for this, unfortunately, is not due to any believable psychological trauma \u0096 rather, it seems that the murders are here simply to allow the writer to display his personal political beliefs.It is difficult for me to write this, as I truly believe that Jimmy McGovern is one of the greatest writers in the world. Nor do I have a problem with movies that are about current issues, or movies that take a political stand. But in the Cracker universe, we expect to see the characters behaving like human beings, not like caricatures. Instead, the Americans in this movie are all depicted in an entirely stereotypical fashion. They are knownothing loudmouths who complain about everything, treat the locals like crap and cheat on their wives \u0096 one of them even manages to do all of the above within less than 5 minutes. I honestly thought I would mistakenly switched channels or something.But it does not stop there. We get constant reminders of just how badly the war in Iraq is going \u0096 reminders that have nothing whatsoever to do with the story and appear practically out of nowhere. The killer is so busy ranting about how Bush is worse than Hitler that he almost forgets to get on with the killing; but more to the point, he is such a mouthpiece for the writers political views that he forgets to act like a believable human being, and thus we \u0096 as an audience \u0096 do not buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man to a tortured serialkilling soul.I cannot say that this ruined the show for me \u0096 it is was still good TV, better than almost everything else in the genre mainly due to, once again, Coltrane. But its constant politicizing made it impossible for it to be as good as the real Cracker classics like To Be A Somebody \u0096 an episode that was just as issuey, but one that was handled with far more subtlety and psychological depth.Two other small points Panhandle not being around is a disappointment, but what is worse are her replacements. The entire police department \u0096 which for so long filled with such great characters  is now full of vanilla. Completely interchangeable cops who lack any and all personality how you could drain Couplings Richard Coyle of personality is beyond me, but it is indeed missing here.Also, there are couple of moments where the show lost its believability for me. One such instance revolves around Fitz having to narrow down the entire population of Manchester from 1 million to a hundred based on some very strange criteria French windows? How does the computer know if I have French windows? \u0096 he not only succeeds in doing this, but he succeeds in less than an hour. I do not think so.So, all in all, I was a little disappointed. It is recommended viewing, but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door. Still, if there is new series to come after this, it would all have been for the good I am convinced that McGovern can still write great stuff, and maybe now that he is got his politics out of his system he can go back to writing about people.","label":0},{"index":5841,"txt":"I hope whoever coached these losers on their accents was fired. The only high points are a few of the supporting characters, 3 of 5 of my favourites were killed off by the end of the season and one of them was a cat, to put that into perspective.The whole storyline is centered around sex, and nothing else. Sex with vampires, gay sex with gay vampires, gay sex with straight vampires, sex to score vampire blood, sex after drinking vampire blood, sex in front of vampires, vampire sex, nonvampire sex, sex because we are scared of vampires, sex because we are mad at vampires, sex because we just became a vampire, etc.Nothing against sex, it would just be nice if it were a little more subtle with being peppered into the storyline. Perhaps HAVE a storyline and then shoehorn some sex into it. But they did not even bother to do that... and Anna Paquin is a dizzy gaptooth bitch. Either she sucks or her character sucks, I cannot figure out which.Another part of the storyline that I find highly implausible is why 150 year old vampire Bill who seems to have his things together would be interested in someone like Sookie. She is constantly flying off the handle at him for things he cannot control. He leaves for two days and she already decides that he is not coming back and suddenly has feelings for dogman? Give me a break. She is supposed to be a 25 year old woman, not a 14 year old girl. People close to her are dying all over, and she is got the brightest smile on her face because she just gave away her Vcard to some dude because she cannot read his mind? As the main character of the story, I would have hoped the show would do a little more to make her understandable and someone to invest your interest in, not someone you keep secretly hoping gets killed off or put into a coma. I cannot find anything about her character that I like and even the fact that she can read minds is impressively uninspiring and not the least bit interesting.I will not be wasting my time with watching Season 2 come June.","label":0},{"index":5842,"txt":"As a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse books, I find this series to be a totally crass representation of them. Vampire Bill is not very good looking and looks much older than described in the book. I found that they have made already wonderfully colourful characters seem very course and vulgar. One of the things I loved about the books is that despite all the crap that she is going through Sookie is always a lady, and yet in the TV series she does not seem like that at all. Not only that but the prejudices displayed in the TV series are not nearly as wide spread in the books. I did not expect an exact replica of the books but I at least expected the feel of them to be used for the series.","label":0},{"index":5843,"txt":"Man, I really find it hard to believe that the wonderful Alan Ball had anything to do with this mess. Having seen the first two episodes thus far, I think I can safely say this show is not going to be on my must see list. It is just got so many things working against it.None of the actors cast are particularly good. Anna Paquin as the lead character Sookie, is just awful. I remember her being better in a lot of other things I have seen her in so maybe it is just the writing. She is not really much fun to look at either, there are moments where to be honest she looks downright ugly. The actor who plays Bill is marginally better, if only because his character is supposed to be sort of wooden and aloof. The other actors do their best but with the clich\u00e9 characters with difficult to perform accents they are given it is a tough job. Tara is an absolute misery to watch, Rutina Wesley absolutely murders the accent. It is like nails on a chalkboard bad. Almost as awful is Nelsan Ellis, it is difficult to understand what he is even saying sometimes. Both his character as well as Taras also seem a bit racist to me. I do not know, having a character say whycome on an HBO show that is not The Wire just seems a bit odd. Rounding out the cast so far are Sookies doddering grandmother, her sex addict brother, and the only bit of genius casting I have seen in William Sanderson as the sheriff.The story seems to be meandering towards it is destination at this point, with no real worry about keeping the viewer interested. The romance stuff is very Dark Shadowsy. Although this show ups the camp factor from something like those old Dark Shadows episodes times about ten. At times it seemed so campy to me, that I just have to assume it was intended to be. But unlike a show such as Buffy, that pulled camp off masterfully, this show does not. Out of place with the campiness is the extreme gore and graphic sex of the show. I am not averse to either of these when they are done well, as they have in many other HBO shows but here at least they prolonged rough sex scenes involving Jason Stackhouse seem a bit over the top and pointless.About the only nice thing I can really think to say about this mess is that I liked the opening title sequence. HBO has had a string of bad luck with their shows lately, I hope they cancel this after the first season and try to get something better on the air.","label":0},{"index":5844,"txt":"I rarely make these comments but I felt compelled to spare others the pain I endured in watching this movie. It is so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply cannot suspend disbelief. The problem starts early, when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new Porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle, overlooking the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. That kind of life on a government salary? Hah! It only gets worse. Toward the end, when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys, the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die, in order to cleanse the gene pool. The special effects are pretty good  any producers money can buy that  and the lead actors have been great in other films, but the screenplay and direction here are moronic. Many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind Paul Verhoevens previous, facially stupid movies Showgirls, Starship Troopers, but this movie should stop the wondering. He is just plain bad.","label":0},{"index":5845,"txt":"When I first watched the show, the first few episodes seemed promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as the stereotypical mysterious vampire and Sookie presented herself as an independent woman. However, the show went downhill from here and the once interesting characters are as entertaining as a cardboard box.As the story progresses the main characters lose their original personalities, along with their acting abilities. By episode 5, Bills furrowed eyebrows are so low that his face just consists of a forehead. Sookie, or rather the actress, is even more dead than her vampire lover. All these tragic events are surrounding her and she only reacts to how enjoyable it was losing her virginity. Personally, I think they made the main characters sleep with each other too early in the show. The way they teased each other was something that had me hooked and could easily be toyed with a bit more. As soon as Sookie loses it she struts around like a total ditz, only thinking of Bills libido and the size of his appendage. Bill also loses his debonair attitude and well, he just gets plain silly. His actions are never really explained except he does it for Sookie. Why? Their love for each other is never delved into, if there is any love. So far it just seems to be sex that is the core of their relationship.Yeah, yeah, vampires usually equal sex but come on. Every five seconds I see some sort of humping going on. It was not that much of a surprise, since HBO always tries to pass of a soft core porno as a decent TV show. Bill popping out of the dirt and just getting it on with Sookie with no reason what is so ever? I laughed so hard I almost peed myself.The plot is just a stream of consciousness. The characters never go into detail about anything. All the events that happen are usually left unexplained. The only thing that is constant is the sex.The only thing I can say that I do like are the minor characters. Tara and her drunk mother are far more interesting than the major characters. The only reason why I continue to watch the show is for the development of the minor characters. Minus the sex and the main characters the show would be much more worthwhile.","label":0},{"index":5846,"txt":"For every series that makes it to television, a 100 ideas are formed, 50 scripts are written, 15 pilots are made, and one, just one, actually makes it to production. From such a selection process, we are lead to believe that the final product must be the cream of the crop, for what other reason could so many ideas be rejected to give us a single television series.And so it goes with True Blood; all the stars were in alignment and what started as a series of novels was transformed into an idea, a screen play, a pilot, and finally a series. Unfortunately, it can sometimes be a long journey and along the way there are many turns that ultimately change what was good and pure into and show that production people feel would be best for ratings. Oh how wrong they so often are...True Blood is an example of a creative concept that has developed into one of the poorest story lines, worst acting, and silliest subplots as anything in recent television history. Its international cast of relatively unknown actors struggle to find their voices but keep tripping over their fake southern accents. Alan Balls not so secret desires for Ryan Jason Stackhouse gives us a fresh nude shot each week although it often has nothing to do with the storyline. Taras angry black woman characterization fails to connect and you find yourself secretly hoping the vamps take her out quickly before she goes into another speech about white suppression while attend a ceremony for the Glorious Dead of the Confedercy. Sam finds suppressed love for Sookie and suddenly we are to believe he needs to watch over her morning, noon, and night despite years of working with her and avoiding any such relationship.As for Bill the Vampire, his moral high ground is quickly surrendered at the first chance to make love with Sookie and has no issue with make a quick snack of her although she remains somewhat unharmed. We find the other vampires not so mainstream as Bill but greatly desiring to become accepted by a public as they look at the living as Happy Meals with legs.Despite my best efforts of suffering through the first six episodes, I have come to the realization that no matter how long you watch a bad show, its still bad. Somethings die for a reason, even vampires. Maybe this show should to.","label":0},{"index":5847,"txt":"This show had a lot of hype but I did not know about it until the midseason season 1. Someone even recommended the show to me. But I decided that if I was going to watch it, I was going to wait until the end of the season so I could watch it in bulk. Due to the show is format, I am happy I waited. I imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hanger then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the story.Somehow, this show has managed to throw in too much sex. Jason will have sex with pretty much anything that moves. Right after he finds out that one woman he had sex with was killed, he is in bed with another woman the next night! Then Tara and Sam get it on, despite each of them knowing that Sam is in love with Sookie. And for some reason, Sookie gets mad when she later finds out about iteven though she is sleeping with a vampire. One of the problems with the show, is that it does not do a good job of making you care about the characters. I really did not care for Jason at all. Along with his endless pursuit of tale, he was rude to the people who actually were concerned for him. After a few episodes, I would not have minded if he got killed somehow. For that reason, I was for the most part uninterested in the murders until Sookies Grandmother became a victim since the first two were more closely involved with Jason.Then once Sookie and Bill have sex, the story gets a few more subplots. Taras mother wants an exorcism, then the exorcist lady tries to convince Tara that she should have one to remove her own demon. I was not so much bothered by the whole exorcism thing as I know there are some people who really believe in that stuff. However, they waste little time in showing that is it a farce right after Tara spends about 1300 on exorcisms for her and her mother. At other points, some of the developments happen too fast. Jason continues being a jerk, trying to sell his Grandmothers stuff to buy vampire blood, which apparently is the new crack or something. In his search he finds this girl who will do V vampire blood with him. They get high, and within three days fall in love with each other and kidnap a vampire for a constant source of V. Another example is when Bill has to go to a vampire tribunal. He is only gone for two days before Sookie starts to feel abandoned and start to wonder if he thinks vampire politics are more important than her.Subtlety is not this show is strong suit. It does not take a genius to figure out something is going on with the local dog. Although my assumption was not dead on, it was not that much of a surprise. But the finale two episodes was where it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in your face as if you could not possibly figure the out for yourself. When Tara gets into the car accident, the naked ladys face with the pig is clearly shown, and was easily recognizable when she shows up at the jail for the bailout. As if that was not enough, they later show the lady again with the pig at her house. Then it is time to wrap up the murder story. At the end of the penultimate episode, it is revealed that Renee is not who he says he is and most likely is the killer. In the final episode, they shove Renee being the killer in your face. Sookie remarks that it is odd that Renees thoughts do not have an accent. I thought that was fine, as it adds to Renee being a fraud. But the next scene is full of incriminating evidence against Renee. They show that Renee has the tape of Maudette with the vampire and his fianc\u00e9e finds a tape in one of Renees boxes about how to fake a Cajun accent. At this point it was just ridiculous. I mean WE GET IT!!! So blah blah blah stuff happens. Bill almost kills himself while failing to save Sookie, who still manages to kill Renee. They start to set up season 2 by leaving unfinished issues. The naked pig lady and Sam have a history, Lafayette has gone missing and might have been killed. Jason is in the process of being brainwashed into being a religious nut by some antivampire churchwhich makes me care about him even less.It is almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show. I think I just expected this show to be better. I am interested in seeing what happens in season 2, but if I watch it, I will most likely wait for the season completion.","label":0},{"index":5848,"txt":"After watching some of HBOs great stuff  Band of Brothers, Rome, etc.  I must say I had pretty high expectations before watching the first episode of True Blood. Jeez. Often the script seemed to be written by an 8yearold, some parts are just horribly filmed, The scene in which she saves Bill, I mean come on. She throws a chain at the guy and ow! it goes around his neck and it magically chokes him! That was pretty embarrassing if you want my opinion. Or a few moments before that scene, when she finds out that the couple is gone with Bill, ridiculous. She hears them plan their stuff, and like 5 seconds later, magic! The 3 of them are gone, and without any struggle or noise or anything!I mean the idea of the show seemed interesting, mysterious, intriguing, vampires coexisting with human in our modern society... but honestly I do not think they really wanted to make more of this than a petty soap show, that the average teen girl watches all the time but that nobody else cares about... Unfortunately, the script is written poorly, mediocre at best. It is shallow and extremely predictable. Often I thought that this was some kind of a joke or something. The actors deliver really unconvincing performances, if you want my opinion. They seem to take the show very lightly, as if it were some kind of a regular, low budget family TV show well maybe thats what it is, if you take away the family part. The only actor that seemed somewhat good to me was Stephen Moyer in the role of Bill, considering the poorly written, extremely short replies he had to say What are you... Can I give you a call sometime..., I think he did good in bringing out the somewhat mysteriously scary part of a vampire that anyone with a vampire role must have, actually. Anna Paquin was okay as well, but not more. But the guy, playing her brother though, jeez, he is horrible. The scene in which he gets arrested is just simply a shame to modern television. The acting is bad, the construction site looks fake to the bone, and the two other guys Why is he getting arrested? Uh.. I dunno... That was pretty embarrassing. Another thing that I think was completely missed was the way they presented Sookies psychic powers. They make us hear what people think AND speak both at the same time and thats just wrong. Often it just seems unnecessarily chaotic, as if peoples thought were some sort of an annoying radio channel, and that when she comes close to em she hits the right frequency level and has to hear everything that they think. And finally, the sex scenes are just plainly unnecessary and that vampire sex tape thing was just totally disgusting. Do not get me wrong  I wrote all these comments not because I thought the show was BAD, but because I was very disappointed. I expected quality stuff. I did not think it was going to be like that.

She begins to get a hankering forblood, and meets up with John Savage, looking like he iswondering where he left Michael Ciminos phone number. Savageis also a vampire and wants to let Andreef join his little vampirefamily, which consists of a British vamp, the blonde vamp whoattacked Starr, and a green haired midget I am not making thisup.The family does not want Starr, so they try to kill Savage and Starrand Starrs kid.Someone forgot to tell John Savage that this was a drama. Hespends most of his screen time exhibiting more facial tics thanHugh Grant on a Jolt Cola bender, and he reads all of his lines likehe is making a Farrelly Brothers film. Andreeff tries to make themost of a badly written role, but screenwriterdirector Ruben goesfor all the vampire cliches, like Starr eating her sons pet hamsterand buying a lot of raw meat to fight the craving for blood. The kidalso gets knocked around a lot, for those who think watchingviolence against children is really entertaining.The film is extra gory, but not in a wild, over the top way like KillerTongue. Here, the gore is gross and never justified, it just occurs.It is just in the budget. Most of the R rating goes to Andreeffscoworkers, who are put through embarassing strip routines in thebackground of conversation scenes. The budget does not includevampire fangs! All the vampires here must stab their prey to eat.Nifty idea, unless you have already seen George RomerosMartin.Even at 77 minutes, and once you throw in Rubens attempts atarty direction skewed frames, blurred scenes, this is onetiresome, dull, and dirty ride.

The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his dialogue at the beginning, and some funny parts in the movie. The little kid in this movie is annoying, and the whole situation is bullshit. I saw this movie at movie stores around America, so I assumed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, was I wrong!!!! The acting is all horrible, and the nudity itself is lame and nasty.

Come on, what is more entertaining than a vampire midget? There is one scene in this film where John Savage gets laid by saying I want to feel human again, and the chick, being the brainless stripper slut she is, lets him feel human.

She acidently tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires as they get carried away making out on the floor of the dressing room. Savage is then assigned by a short leader of this rare vampire breed that looks like a cross between 80s punk rock and one of the Olsen twins with purple hair. This movie just gets all to crazy with Savage rapping and dancing with a midget with a tattooed spider on his head, also one of the rare. He quotes the Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante and I just had to laugh. This just gets rediculas. And then the most gross special effects that they could come up with is Corri throwing up her organs and pulling them out of her mouth. And you can tell that that is all to fake. Her son does not know what to do with his moms new identity and becomes more of a pest than an object of serenity. I enjoy a good vampire film, believe me I do but I just HATED this one. Even the photography stinks, in and out blurs with the camera switching this way and that trying to make it look like the vampires move to fast for the camera to keep up and then the camera turns all to bright in the scene of Savage chasing the son of Corri around till he blinds himself.

Unfortunately, it is ruined by too much melodrama and an impossible timeline.The movie concerns a missile from space that is attacked by the Soviets and inadvertently diverted into a low atmospheric orbit. At under five miles and at a speed in excess of 4,000 miles, it emits an exhaust of a million degrees, burning up everything on the ground, including glaciers, Distant Early Warning DEW line bases and Eskimos.Every attempt at destroying the missile fails.The first flaws in this film appear early on. While we do not expect much from lowbudget films, some things cannot be forgotten  like a little research. For instance, both the Soviets and the US fire antiballistic missiles that home in on the missile with unerring accuracy. However, the first successful ABM tests were not done until March of 1961 by the Russians.There is too much melodrama. Dr. Loring Loggia and his assistant Joan Woods Ellen Parker play their romance with about as much wood as a log cabin. Parkers character cries and boohoos at Loggias sacrifice like she was at a screen test. Loggia is about as heroic as a bored businessman. A scientist Phillip Pine hams it up so much he makes William Shatner look like a thespian. A bus driver continually spits out endoftheworld crap in scene after scene. The only good actor is the film narrator, played by veteran character actor Lawrence Dobkins Naked City.All of this could be overlooked if it was not for the timeline. After the missiles info is sent to DC, the Pentagon brings in a group of scientists. A general Larry Kerr announces that the missile will hit New York City in 63 minutes. After this, there are discussions by scientists and there is a deadly lull as word is sought from ambassadors to see if the missile is an attack from the Russians and if a response is necessary.The film shows the military being fully scrambled. Civil Defense people leave work and go to their stations. Eight million people scramble to fallout shelters while school buses pick up millions of kids and we get to see the whitest New York City I have ever seen, though watching 50s scifi films made it seems like this was the standard. The press is kept in the dark for tens of minutes. Then, incredibly, a man at the Pentagon announces that the missile will hit Ottawa, Canada in 51 minutes! All of the aforementioned action happened in 12 minutes! Then, to add fuel to the fire, Loggia somehow thinks of a way to stop the alien missile. He slowly produces a caseload of plutonium, loads it in a jeep and takes it from DC to a distant missile base to put it atop a missile. Along the way, he is knocked off the road by a wild driver, breaks down and then is carjacked. He finally gets the plutonium back and drives to the base to arm the missile. Again, all this in the same 63minute time frame.The movie also irks the viewer by making it seem as if Ottawa might be saved, only to show men, women and children get roasted. The missile is then said to have five minutes to reach New York. Loggia is still driving to the base 4 more miles to go. He gets to the base and arms the missile, a twominute countdown is then announced. All within five minutes. The boroughs of New York should have been at least scorched.By the way, the missile is destroyed if you have not guessed. The ABM warhead destroys it with a massive plutoniumbased nuclear blast. Five seconds later, the blast dissipates and all is clear. Yeah, they caused a nuclear blast equivalent to 100 Hiroshimas on the outskirts of New York City and nothing happens.The film had all the elements necessary to be a good B film, but wasted them. Loggia played his character so lamely you did not care that he sacrificed himself in the end. You did not care about the other characters, not even the smarmy scientist played by Pine. The tension that should have moved the film along just was not physically possible in the timeline allowed it still would not be today, not even with Jack Bauer.This film is very difficult to find. As far as I know, it has not been reissued on any medium and for good reason. I do not know if the film meant to be or if it was standard practice, but there is a scene where the government sends all of the best scientists, military men and businessmen into deep shelters, saying they are too valuable to lose. There is not a single woman or minority in the bunch. Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the film and he gets a brief bit playing a piano. It was worse than 27 Days where an alien gives five Earthlings the chance to either save or destroy the planet and he does not include any blacks or Hispanics.I saw this on a special Scifi night on Turner Classic Movies and I do not expect it to show up again. If you do find a copy of this somewhere, you might want to put it up on Amazon.com.","label":0},{"index":5865,"txt":"The story idea behind THE LOST MISSILE is not bad at all, but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well as poor special effects sink this film to the subpar level.The film begins with a missile heading towards the Earth. In a panic because it is about to strike the Earth, the Soviets manage to deflect the object. This is not necessarily good, however, as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path AND the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet. In other words, with each pass it makes, a swath of death followsone that could potentially kill us all!! So, it is up to the good scientists of the US led by a very young and hardly recognizable Robert Loggia to formulate and plan to save usand especially save New York that is in its immediate flight path! Unfortunately, they are not able to save Ottawa I have never been there, so I cannot say whether or not this is a big loss but thanks to good old American knowhow, they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction!! So, as you can see, the story idea is not bad and rather original. But, so many old clips of fighter planes and guys manning radar scopes gets a bit old and it seemed like padding.

Its 70minute running time is very well padded with stock footage. The rest are non descript exteriors and drab interiors scenes. The plot exposition is very poorly rendered. They are all just perfunctory scenes sort of strung together. There is no attempt at drama in scene selection but rather drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors. Please do not ask.The plot concerns a rocket radiating a million degree heat orbiting earth five miles up threatening to destroy the earth. It is a real time menace that must be diverted if a custom built Hbomb can be fashioned and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour. Nothing very much here to report except for a mad speech by a scientist against the project because there might be some sort of life aboard and think of the scientific possibilities but this speech made by the obligatory idiot liberal was pretty much pass\u00e9 by then.What saves this film, somewhat uniquely, IS the stock footage. I have never seen a larger selection of fifties jet fighter aircraft in any other film. This is by no means a complete list but just some of the aircraft I managed to see. There is a brief interception by a pilot flying, in alternate shots, an F89 Scorpion and an F86. First to scramble interceptors is the Royal Canadian Air Force in Hawker Hunters and F86 Sabre Jets or Canadian built CF13s and even a pair of CF100 Clunks.Then for some reason there are B52s, B47s and even B36s are seen taking off. More padding.These Canadian jets are moving at 1200 miles an hour. I do not think so since one of them appears to be a WW2 era Gloster Meteor, the rest F80s. The Meteors press the attack and one turns into a late F84F with a flight of early straight wing F84s attacking in formation.There is a strange tandem cockpit version of the F80 that does not seem to be the T33 training type but some sort of interim allweather interceptor variant with radar in the nose. These are scrambled in a snowstorm.An angled deck aircraft carrier is seen from about 500 meters. It launches F8U Crusaders, F11F Tigers, A5 Vigilantes and A3 Skywarriors. The Air Force scrambles F86s and F84s and more F89s then you have ever seen in your life as well as F100 Super Sabres and F102 Delta Daggers.The F100s press their attack with sooooo much padding. The F89s unload their rockets in their wingtip pods in slo mo. The F86s fire, an F102 lets loose a Falcon, even some F80s F94s? with midwing rocket pods let loose. There is a very strange shot of a late model F84 prototype? with a straight wing early model F85 above it in a turn, obviously a manufacturers Republic Aviation advertising film showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the F84 ThunderJet. How it strayed into here is anybodies guess.There is other great stock footage of Ottawa in the old days when the capital of Canada was a wide spot in the road and especially wonderful footage of New York Citys Times Square during one of the Civil Defense Drills in the early 50s. I think we also have to deal with the notion that this was filmed in Canada with the possible exception of the auto chase seen late in the picture as the Pacific seems to be in the background. The use of a Jowett Jupiter is somewhat mindboggling and there is a nice TR 3 to be seen also. Canada must have been cheap and it is rather gratuitously used a lot in the background.As far as the actual narrative of the film there is little to recommend it other than the mystery of just who Ellen Parker is giving the finger to at the end of the picture. And she most definitely is flipping someone off. Could it be, R as in Robert Loggia? The director who dies before this film was released?

I think I need to repeat this  The two lead actors who stand side by side on the advertisement posters and DVD covers did not have one scene together!!!! They did not speak to each other and never appeared on screen at the same time. Just about sums up this poor excuse for a movie. False advertisement.The dialogue was painful, every single character in the movie was unrealistic, and unhuman like.

Sometimes, they want us to see Shane as the enemy. Sometimes they want us to see him as a poor misunderstood soul. Sometimes they want us to see Vic as a dangerous, sexual dynamo. Sometimes they want us to see him as a poor guy with a heart of gold. Sometimes they want us to see Mara as a low down vile Jezebel. Then they think that if they show her sitting and talking over her dreams with Shane, that we will find her to be sympathetic and tragic.None of this manipulation is adequate to obtain the kinds of sympathies they want. Once they have shown these characters ruin other peoples lives for their own ends, that is it. It is nonsense to keep trying to flip back and forth.

We are left hanging, but with nothing much else save languid shots of grave and pensive male faces to savour. Certainly no rope up the wall to help us climb over. It is a shame, because the concept is not without merit.We are left wondering why a loving couple  a father and son no less  should be so estranged from the real world that their own world is preferable when claustrophobic beyond all imagining. This loss of presence in the real world is, rather too obviously and unnecessarily, contrasted with the son having enlisted in the armed forces. Why not the circus, so we can at least appreciate some colour? We are left with a gnawing sense of loss, but sadly no enlightenment, which is bewildering given the film is apparently about some form of attainment not available to us all.","label":0},{"index":5882,"txt":"From a plot and movement standpoint, this movie was terrible. I found myself looking at the clock in theater hoping it would end and relieved after 80 long minutes that it mercifully did. Basically, five characters appear in the movie, A Son  Father, sons girl friend, and two male characters of the sons age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation. The movie and scenes seemed to suggest homoeroticism, but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another. There were a couple of brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the movie, the sons girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation. The photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two, ending with her admitting to having another man who was older. End of that story.","label":0},{"index":5883,"txt":"Set in South Africa, a young black guy tries to land a part in a gangsta movie. But with no knowledge of street life, he is told to find out what that life is really like or he will not get the part. He manages to work his way into a gang led by an old friend of his from school and his chances of appearing in the film decline as he commits crimes to be accepted. But for the gangs leader, the burgeoning disaster of his new friends life suggests a golden opportunity to do something better with his own.While that may sound relatively interesting, it is anything but. The first half of it is incredibly meandering and tedious, while the hijacking only takes place towards the end with some very poorly executed low speed car chases. In those chases, only two police cars are used, both of which are early 90s Nissan Sunnys. Not only would these be rather cheap to pick up and I find it rather hard to believe they would be using such mundane old cars in South Africa in the year 2000, but as far as I can remember, there is only 2 involved and none of them get a scratch once. The car chases are very badly shot, with distant and badly timed camera angles and minimal traffic on the roads, and they are all over in around 2 minutes at maximum as you are supposed to believe that a very small kid is actually a highly skilled driver who can easily evade the police despite the driving being pedestrian and utterly unexciting. This now leads me onto the characters and the acting, which are equally bad. The aforementioned kid who drives the car, looks about 13 years old and supposedly is extremely skilled at losing the incredibly inept police. Everybody else is equally unconvincing, so much that they even look bored at times themselves.At the closing scene of the movie, our main character Sox Moraka is asked by the gang leader to steal a car from a car park. While having trouble opening it, the Police arrive and ask him what he is doing and he replies by telling him it is their car. After a brief argument they try to arrest him and he then holds the Police at gunpoint and jumps back in their car. After he is in, the Police return fire and in turn he gets wounded. After another pathetic chase sequence, they decide to abandon the car and set it alight to destroy any evidence. What follows here is one of the most downright laughable and hideously awful special effects I have ever seen. When the car explodes, superimposed flames suddenly appear from every window with awful sound effects that are not even in time. It is so badly done and so phony looking that it is hard to even put it into words, and really needs to be seen to be believed. If you watch it in slow motion it looks even funnier. I have seen better effects than this in murder reconstruction documentaries. The car is a Volkswagen Golf MK2 GTi. Something that would not be worth a huge amount at all, and they seriously could not afford to destroy it with a real explosion? I would love to know how large the budget for this movie was. It feels so cheap that I am surprised it made it outside of South Africa, and even more surprised it made it to a DVD release.I know it is not a big budget Hollywood production. I know it is meant to depict gangs in impoverished townships of South Africa who steal cars from the middle class in and sell the parts on the black market, but with the laughable effects, poorly executed car chases, awful acting and ludicrous characters, any sense of reality is completely lost.Overall, I most certainly do NOT advise you to watch this. If you want to have a laugh and see one of the most poorly done, low budget messes of amovie ever created, then I would recommend it for that, and only that.It is a wretched, poorly made, poorly edited, poorly paced and tedious piece of low budget drivel that fails on all counts. I have seen many South African movies, including lots of cheap NuImageNuWorld action pictures, and despite their cheesiness, they are far better than this on all counts.","label":0},{"index":5884,"txt":"What an insult to the SA film industry!

I am currently in the process of recovering from a seizure, due to reading some of the comments on this film on here. I am actually shocked at the fact that someone actually said this film was realistic! All I can say is thank god the Cold War never escalated or else we might as well have given the Commies our borders... I found this film dire in the utmost pretence, maybe it is just my British perception of what makes a film funny, who knows? But in all aspects, this film is not just awful, its teeth grindingly terrible.I have never been a fan of Bill Murray, and its rubbish like this that justify my feelings towards him. Do not get me wrong, I loved Ghostbusters, which was made only three years after this film. But this just sums Bill Murray up really. I can safely say that I have not wasted my time so blatantly like this since seeing the first running of Operation Delta Force over here, though these two films have more in common than you would think. For 1 thing, they both have terrible action sequences from beginning to end, and 2nd. They are both riddled with cheesy Clich\u00e9s, throughout.Heres one thing, these guys are supposed to be in the U.S Army. Yet they are allowed to wallow around their Camp, Willy nilly, seducing female Military Police Officers, and subsequently shagging them silly in the Generals Quarters. Talk about Random! This film is just terrible for this I am afraid. Now do not get me wrong, I am no feminist sympathiser, but the fact that these two women actually fall hands over heels in love with the two characters shortly after arresting them, letting them go free... Twice, is just insulting to the female race. The fact that one tatty haired, fat lipped bum Winger and his hapless sidekick Ramis can simply sweet talk themselves into into the MPs underwear, to which they fall madly in love with the two of them is nothing short of ludicrous.Then there is the training scenes, where you get to meet the Squad Phycho who unconvincingly threatens to kill anyone who touches him or his stuff, followed by the overweight bloke played by the late and great John Candy who claims he joined the army to avoid paying 400 for anger management classes. Leading to loud mouthed Murray paying tribute to the Giant Toe, WTF? Drill Seargent who honestly could not organise a pi up in a brewery, let alone his band of recruits. All this scene serves to do is to prelude loads of fight scenes, with people saying way to go ass hole! all the time, etc etc.The scenes then carry on showing the rag tag bunch making utter tits of themselves on the Assault Course, leading to a scene where one of them shoots wildly into the air at some passing birds with an assault rifle, peppering a watch tower with bullets. Just like that. Yep, told you this film was random...He miraculously escapes undisciplined as well... Eventually Leading up the the passing out parade, where the hapless squad make a magic turn around within the space of two hours. Bugger me, Miracle! Thanks to some wise words from Murray, to which they then direct a massively none military like dance routine in front of a Geriatric General in front of the rest of the squads. All of this to the immense pleasure of their two Girlfriends on the stand, who really should have been arresting them... Everyone laughs it off though. This bit is nothing short of amazing though. He then chooses them to guard a new MultiMillion Dollar Prototype Armoured Vehicle in Italy which turns out to be just a mobile home painted green with loads of gadgets on the inside, claiming This is exactly what this Army needs! righto...Then there is the dire finale, where Murray and Ramis decide to steal this topsecret prototype Military Vehicle to pick up their newly acquired and somewhat Hyperactive MP Girlfriends in Germany. To which the Hapless Captain John Larroquette then finds out and leads the Squad of fresh recruits on a retrieval Mission for this vehicle. To which they then take a wrong turn enroute and end up in Soviet Held Czechoslovakia, where they are captured. Like we did not see that coming... Thus begins a rescue attempt by Ramis and Murray  Birds in hand, to which is where a big fight, loads of shooting from the hip and blowing tanks up. With them coming back as National Heroes, humiliating the Russians by calling them pussies, etc etc. The end. Thats right. No Courts Martial, nothing. They only just stole a prototype Military vehicle, drove it into a Warsaw Pact country and almost caused an International incident which could have sparked WW3!This film is honestly more fun that being diagnosed with a terminal illness. I know its meant to be a Comedy, it got all the right actors for it, but where in the hell is it? Have Channel 5 cuts those bits out? The only redeeming feature in this film is the repetitive use of naked women taking showers, and female Mud Wrestling. like I said, Random Not that it helps to divert from the fact that this is an utterly crap film, of course.

Well, the verdict is in and Stripes is a bad movie.Now, Stripes may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s, and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are Bill Murray fans, but its still a bad movie.Why is it bad? Mostly because Stripes is supposed to be a comedy but it is just not that funny. There are some laughs, but they are few and far between. Most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you are used to more contemporary comedies such as Anchorman which strive for laughs in every part of the movie.Stripes further suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Ramiss lack of acting ability. Bill Murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career, and Harold Ramis is playing Harold Ramis. These two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie.Lastly, most of the comedy that there is in Stripes revolves around Bill Murrays selfcentered, smartalec manchild character so if you do not find that character funny like I did not you are not going to find most of what little comedy there is in Stripes funny either.Stripes is very much a movie of its era, it has not aged well and is not worth watching.

For one thing, as others have pointed out, it takes almost the entire movie for the much ballyhooedatthetime revolt to break out. For another, whether the last scene is real or imagined, what occurs is not a revolt, but a shooting rampage. There is quite a difference.I know it may be bad form to judge a movie on subsequent events, but one cannot avoid doing it here. One person wrote a message board posting asking us not to compare the end of movie to the incidents at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. But if there is a scintilla of difference between Klebold, Harris and Cho on the one hand and Travis Malcom McDowell on the other, I simply cannot see it. All four of them were under the delusion that their gunfire is going to purify a f___ed up world that they arrogantly take no responsibility for.Which brings me to why the hell are Travis and his chums even in a school they so despise? They are adults, or close to it. They are not in a military prison, like the inmates in The Hill, a much better British film from about the same time. No one is forcing them to go to College and take beatings from the the whips, except maybe ambitious parents in need of a wakeup about the nature of their sons. I had the opportunity in college to join a frat, except I could not stand to be given silly, cruel orders by delinquents claiming to be my prospective brothers. I took the consequences of not having the in with the Establishment that frats provide, and I cannot say I regretted it.If Travis fancies himself the second coming of Lenin whose unbearded picture hangs prominently in his room he is free to go out and organize a fitters union or work for Michael Foot in the next election. If he wants to be Jack Kerouac, then get on the road and start writing. What possible benefit is he giving the world in joyriding a motorcycle and getting drunk in his room?Sometimes reviewers have to be like the person who responded to the scene in Last Tango In Paris where Brando mopes about having had to go on a date with cow manure on his shoes. In the real world, the person said, a listener would say Why did not you scrape it off? Change your shoes?

Lindsay Anderson was known to be a fan of Luis Bu\u00f1uel, on top of generally being too smart for his own good. And despite a straightforward narrative through the first and second acts, the latter portion of the piece it taken hostage by cod Bu\u00f1uel surrealism and strained attempts at symbolism.

In that one instance, writerdirector Ousmane Sembene gives the audience a character that is easy to root for, an interesting film character that could be worth watching for two hours. In the scene, he presents a brave woman who is bold in her actions. For the rest of the movie, the only other thing he seems to present is conflicting tones. The tone is all over the place. It is true not all movies have to clearly fit within a specific genre, but I do not think Faat Kine fits into any genre. Supposedly, it is a drama, though there are moments of such broad comedy the aforementioned spraying in the face that it cannot be taken seriously. On the other hand, the film is certainly not a comedy with the abundant amount of serious topics Sembene has crammed into the picture. There is a way to successfully mix comedy and drama together. Unfortunately, Semebene does not find that balance. Instead, one scene after another just drift into each other without much rhyme or reason, leaving two different tones hanging in the wind. Faat Kine also has the problem of running two hours long with an extremely drawn out finale. The film ends with a big party where all the characters conflicts are resolved, only they are not resolved quickly. The scene lasts longer than any other scene, going on for probably twenty minutes. Because the rest of the scenes up until this point have been meandering, the finale is particularly hard to endure with repetition beginning early on in the scene, making for a frustrating viewing experience.Perhaps I am being too hard on Faat Kine. I am not the right audience for it. I felt nothing towards the characters and had no connection to any part of the story. There are people who will probably find something meaningful in the story and see strong characters. However, I was unable to do so and thus cannot recommend it.","label":0},{"index":5904,"txt":"This movie is extremely boring, it tells a story of a female gas station owner and her life.

He and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods. He ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. The heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, a grabby neighbor, and her sexually abrasive boss. He explains to her that he is going to kill them all. She winds up killing HIM and then turning her focus towards the men or pigs whom she tortures and kills, herself...

Upon escaping, the seemingly innocent man kidnaps three victims and soon he ropes his girlfriend in on the plot. If this is not bad enough, the situation quickly makes a downward spiral.This film had some good aspects and many bad ones. Its strongest aspect was lead actress Emily Haack. Setting aside the fact she is nude in a fair amount of this film, she presents herself as a decent actress and a very strong character. I see no reason she cannot take this experience and somehow turn it into a career in some way. I was convinced she was a ruthless individual.Also, the makers of this film were very bold and pulled no punches. Graphic nudity both male and female, coprophagia, and extreme anal violence are not shied away from. I like my horror films to push the boundaries a little bit, and this one ignored them altogether, gladly skipping towards Gomorrah. Maybe it was too much, but I think they achieved what they were looking for.But now the negative aspects. First, and most noticeable, this film is very low budget and the film quality shows this. I can excuse that  the plot was decent, the acting fine and in some scenes the lower quality film actually made the movie more disturbing a more realistic feel. So, I will not scold them for having lowgrade equipment. What I will scold them for is the use of poor choices in shots. For no reason I can ascertain besides plumping the movie, there is a large amount of footage of a cemetery. I do not really know why, and I frankly started dozing off at this point because it was so long and pointless.I also take issue with the title. The idea here was to deceive people into thinking this film had some connection to the classic I Spit on Your Grave. Now, there is a line that seems to imply the main character is the daughter of the woman from this other film. And the themes are very loosely the same a woman getting revenge on men. But there is no firm connection and the reason this title was chosen was for the video store customer to think they were getting a sequel. This was deceptive and dishonest.My last major complaint is that this plot makes no real sense. Not even a little bit. A woman is killed in the beginning for no reason. A prison escapee finds time to kidnap people to torture them, for no reason because they wronged his girlfriend?. The same man goes from good to very evil without explanation. Likewise, the female lead Haack turns fro ma normal person to someone who is overly cruel and sadistic, for no reason at all, and against people who for the most part were only marginally mean to her a neighbor offering drugs for sex is wrong, but by no means worth getting tortured for.Do not let this title fool you, or the claims that the film is incredibly shocking. Yes, some scenes were shocking, but the vast majority of the film is dull and makes you want to take a nap. If you see this in the video store or on Netflix, just keep browsing.

It is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the head of the shelter for runaways handing her a missing poster from when she was eight. In the real world, if the head of a shelter for runaways found out that he had, under his roof, a solved kidnapping, what would have followed would have been an immediate call to the police.

There is no atmosphere, unless it is one of scuzziness and mild bewilderment and there is no hiding how lame everything looks. The wolfman minions look like a poor mans wookie. For some reason the director fell in love with shots of them leaping through the air in slow motion, Six Million Dollar Man style, toward our heroes when they attack. There are probably about a dozen of these shots throughout the movie and it gets goofier every time. The other minions of the topless sorceress, other than the generic leather clad humans, are some lumpy white mutants who appear to be covered in cobwebs.

Oh yeah, the music is cheap synthesiser stuff that the makers of Doctor Who would have been embarrassed to have used.Ilias, our nominal hero is bland and forgettable. He also looks a complete wuss, especially with his midriff revealing leather outfit and big hair, and is clearly a moron. Sure, he is a dynamite shot with his magical bow but he only takes about three or four arrows with him in his mission to battle this entire continent of evil. Needless to say he runs out of arrows within a few minutes and has to be saved by more traditional sword and sorcery hero, Mace. When he meets Ilias he establishes himself as the taciturn loner type, claiming he has no friends but no sooner can you say latent homoerotic subtext they are bosom buddies, traipsing the misty hills together. Mace promises to take Ilias with him in return for bow related favours. Ilias asks where he is going. Wherever my legs take me, is his reply. Good enough for Ilias. Mace is also animal lover and outrageous hypocrite. He proclaims his great love of and affinity toward animals, citing the usual stuff about how he prefers them to humans because humans can be soooo mean. He says he would never hunt and kill an animal to feed himself but he will steal meat off other people who have hunted down animals. He is also not above randomly killing innocent passers by for no good reason. Not long after they meet, he is testing out Ilias bow and the movie cuts to some random caveman, minding his own business, walking along and Mace shoots him dead. There is no indication this poor soul did anything to deserve this and even Ilias, who supposedly hails from a more moral and civilised society does not even raise an eyebrow. The films villainess is quite unusual. For the entire movie she is completely naked except from a gstring and a golden mask that encompasses her entire head. It is like Fulci included her to make the movies obligatory TA quotient but decided she was bit too much of a butterface at the last minute. She spends a lot of time seemingly being pleasured by her pet snakes and dreaming about being shot by a faceless bow wielding man who is dressed like Ilias. Wow, such symbolism! Later on in the movie she wimps out when she cannot beat Ilias and Mace and promises to make herself the sexslave of some ancient warrior dude if he kills them for her. Hardly the worlds most scary villain and not really a step forward for womens rights. I think he sics the cobweb creatures on our heroes and impersonates Mace in a situation where there is no noone else around but Mace to fool. Was he really worthy trading your self respect for, Ocron? There are quite a few other WTF? moments. Most of them come toward the end of the movie. Ilias wusses out, I forget why, possibly his permed hairdo got mussed, but realizes the error of his ways and returns to aid Mace in fighting the forces of evil. All of a sudden, for no reason, his bow can suddenly fire out multiple target seeking bolts of energy. The bolts can also shoot through solid rock when necessary. Needless to say his makes short work of the hordes of bad guys who have captured Mace.The climax is also rather nonsensical. Mace decimates Ocrons remaining forces using the bows targeted laser attack capability. He then is able to shoot Ocron from a kilometre away using its shoot through rock capacity. She starts dying. Her mask is ripped of revealing a hideous Muppet head. She staggers around screaming and turns into a dog and wanders off with another dog. Mace smiles. Roll credits.Strangely enough as far as these dodgy low budget sword and sorcery movies this one is reasonably lucid and focused. Any one who has seen Wizards of the Lost Kingdom can tell you how nonsensical and meandering these movies can truly be.","label":0},{"index":5934,"txt":"Ah, Lucio Fulci, rest in peace.

On the other hand, CONQUEST seems not to have inspired Fulci in the least \u0096 seeing how he decided to drape the proceedings with an annoyingly perpetual mist, sprinkle it with incongruent characters cannibals vs. werewolves, anyone?, irrelevant gore we are treated to a gratuitous, nasty cannibal dinner just before witnessing the flesheating revelers having their brains literally beaten out by their hairy antagonists! and even some highly unappetizing intimacy between the masked, brainslurping villainess do not ask and her slimy reptilian pet!!

Because their is no action at all in this film. It fudges all its set pieces. All the actors give the kind of performances form a Verhoeven film. In other words rampant over acting on almost every level. Starship Troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world the characters inhabited. In this scientists are acting the same way. Sorry Paul but Soldiers and scientist are not really made of the same mindset.One major flaw in the plot was that after escaping for that one night to do evil things Kevin Bacons character then returns back to the science lab where we have already spent more then enough time watching these animated manniquens Elizabeth Shue excepted walk and talk.

Peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with friend Jack. They try to give the kidnappers fake money in return for Laura but the plan goes horribly wrong and they have to bail out in the helicopter. The helicopter is shot and they also have to bail from that not going well so far. Also roaming the jungles is a devil of sorts. In reality its just a naked black guy with weirdly big eyes and a breathing problem. He starts to kill a few of the kidnappers and Laura escapes only to be captured by some primitives. The rest of the film is a bit of a blur really.Now I am not a massive Jess Franco fan, in fact to date this is only the second film of his I have seen, but even I can tell that this really is not one of his best efforts. The films drags along at a pretty slow pace without much at all happening. The whole thing could have been edited down quite easily into a 25 minute TV show. There are plenty of overly long shots of people walking through the jungle that could have just been lifted straight out.Devil Hunter is poorly lit Infact I do not think it was lit at all, badly dubbed, poorly acted and slow yet for some reason it did not bore me. I think the main reason for this was some of the hilariously bad scenes in it. For example a scene where Laura is walking in the street was obviously shot in a real street as crowds of people stop to stare straight at the camera as its shooting. Another funny scene has one of the gang who has been killed, hung in a tree dripping blood as one of his friends stands directly under him screaming for what seems like minutes. Then for no reason at all the man in the trees head just falls of and hits the guy under him. It has to be seen to be believed. Then of course there is the actual devil. It is just some naked black guy who despite the fact he has massive eyes, he has very blurry vision.The film was hooked up in part of the video nasty scare in the 80s here in the UK and was banned. Now why it was I have no idea. There is very little gore at all and it is hardly a shocking film. Minus the nudity I would have said that it could get away with a PG almost. The only thing I can think of is that it was never actually watched and was added to the original list because of word of mouth.There is not much reason to watch this film really unless you are a massive Jess Franco fan.

In many cases, I just could not feel that the facial expressions matched the words spoken or the intent of the scene. An angry or sad, happy, frustrated character should make the viewer believe that he is angry or sad, happy, frustrated. That does not happen here.The comment about the writers assuming you already know the characters was apt. They do things and say things which come out of nowhere the character Andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to each other at dinner; then he blows up and storms out, telling his father Do not touch me, you f!. Maybe, if we would seen the prequel, we would understand where all that comes from, but there is no prequel, so we are somewhat at sea as to the reason! One odd, quirky thing that Andrew does is to go to an old stone quarry, sit down on the edge overlooking the still water below; then he reaches into his jeans pocket and extracts a pack of cigarettes and lights one up. He did this same thing three times during the film; I guess we are supposed to see this as some tortured act of being alone and angry? Maybe once, but three times? It might even have been four times, I lost count.To be honest, there is the fact that he is recently found out that he is adopted; this happens very early in the film so there is no sense of any dramatic change he might be undergoing because of this discovery. It is not really clear if that is why he is so bitter or if it is about something else.I guess there is a sort of Lynchian feel to the film but should a firsttime director really be trying to scale such a mountain so early in his career?","label":0},{"index":5946,"txt":"this could be one of the worse movies i have ever seen. i do not see how could this ever be described as a horror movie, or even a thriller? its more like a lumbering drama. the scary music is EXCELLENT but since there were not any scary situations the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like taking a dump or walking down stairs. the movie had so much potential. they had beautiful cinematography sp? and interesting characters, but it seemed as if the writers assumed you already knew them. they would undergo peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue at what they meant. this is simply one of those movies that says its about one thing and it something totally different.","label":0},{"index":5947,"txt":"Dead Letter Office is a lowbudget film about a couple of employees of the Australian postal service, struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the links between the characters past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and overschematically represented. What is most disappointing of all, however, is the portrayal is life in the office of the films title there is no mechanisation whatsoever, and it is quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living. Granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s, if it ever truly existed. It is a shame, as the films overall tone is poignant and wry, and there is some promise in the scenario but few of the details convince.

This is the same story I have seen hundreds of times, only told here with slightly different circumstances. The thing is, I could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog were not so stale!The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations, and unfortunately that was also the case with Dead Letter Office.

Well, it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a halfforgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them. As bizarre settings go, it is a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is Dead Letter Office. Having said that, this is obviously an Australian film as opposed to a British one. If it was Royal Mail, most letters get this sort of treatment anyway. I have not been in this flat for two years and we are still getting letters for a Mr Wang, some female priest of the Church of Latter Day I haveNeverHeardOfYou and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company.Dead Letter Office the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up follows the story of Alice Miranda Otto who grows up in a seriously divided home. Writing to her absent father, she only learns in adulthood that her letters have not been delivered for one reason or another. So, logically, she gets a job at the D.L.O. and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding Chilean immigrant Frank Lopez George Del Hoyo. Slowly, she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the selfcontained world of the Dead Letters Office to its knees?Nothing against this film but I was reminded of the godawful Heather Graham film Committed while watching this. However, this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again, that as not difficult. For a start, this film is much more logical. True, the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood. But at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel. It is also well acted. Both Otto and Del Hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they will never find while other characters are peripheral at best. Part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly, leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed. The other part is that when you consider Australias draconian immigration policy i.e. if you do not speak English, rack off!, such a story is unlikely to take place in reality. The other characters, sadly, also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than oddball stereotypes.Despite that, Dead Letter Office is certainly something a little different. It might not be to everyones taste but I liked it. Yes, it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes, it is nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavyduty swearing and nudity no chance of that in an Australian film. There as not any major laughs, there is no Bullet Time and the characters are usually onedimensional. But it is the story that counts here and while it is not earthshattering in its magnificence, it is a pleasant enough way of passing the time.

According to at least one biographer, this was where he became acquainted with cocaine. Add to that his binge drinking, and it is no wonder things fell apart.It is a shame, because the concept behind the film is a good one, and the first ten minutes promise much. Mike Locken James Caan and George Hansen Robert Duvall are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the CIA. They move quick, live well, and seem like the best of friends  then something happens to shatter their brotherhood.An opening scene shows them blowing up a building  why exactly we are not told, par for the course in terms of this films murky motivation. But the implication is these guys hurt people and do not really care  antiheroes much like the Wild Bunch of Peckinpahs notsolongago. An opening title tells us they work for ComTeg, then adds with obvious tongue in cheek ...the thought the CIA might employ such an organization for any purpose is, of course, preposterous. That is a pretty clever way of letting the audience know all bets are off.Add to that a traditionally strong Peckinpah backup cast, including Burt Young, Gig Young, and Peckinpah regular Bo Hopkins in the plum role of a madman who cannot pass up an opportunity to be shot at for 500 a day, and you only wish that the scriptwriters, including the celebrated Sterling Silliphant, tried to do something more with the story than turn it into a platform for lazy oneliners and bad chopsocky knockoffs. An attempt at injecting a dose of liberal social commentary is awkwardly shoehorned in. You are so busy doing their dirty work, you cannot tell who the bad guys are, someone tells Locken, as if either he or we need it pointed out.Worse still are Peckinpahs clumsy direction and sluggish pacing. We are 40 minutes into the film before we get our first battle scene, a completely chaotic collection of random shots where a bunch of people we have not even met before are seen fighting at San Francisco Airport, their battle intercut with a conversation in an office suite.By the end of the film, what is left of the cast is having a battle inside a fleet of mothballed Victory Ships, ninjas running out in the open to be gunned down while Caan tosses off one liners that undercut any hint of real suspense. Lay me seventofive, I will take the little guy, he wisecracks just before a climatic samurai duel between two ninja warriors  from China, which we all know is the land of the Ninja. The battle takes place in San Francisco, but surprisingly no Mounties arrive to break things up.Caan is much better in smaller scenes, like when Locken, recovering from some nasty injuries, is told by one of his bosses, played by a smooth Arthur Hill, that he is been Humptydumped by the organization. Caan refuses to stay down, and his recovery scenes, though momentumkilling for the movie, feature fine acting from him and Amy Heflin, Vans daughter, as a supportive nurse. Caan was one of the 1970s best actors, and his laconic byplay with Heflin, Duvall, Hopkins, and both Youngs give Killer Elite real watchability.But you do not watch Killer Elite thinking about that.

I was hoping before watching Hollow Man that the Invisible Man theme, which is hardly original in itself, would be the basis of something newer and more interesting. This is not so. It is not long before the film turns into an overlyfamiliar blood bath and mass of ineffectual histrionics  the mound of clich\u00e9s piles up so fast that it is almost impressive.On top of all this, Kevin Bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best. Good points might be a passable Jerry Goldsmith score but no competition for his better efforts, a quite interesting use of thermal imagery and the special effects. I was tempted to give this film three out of ten, but the effects push Hollow Mans merit up one notch.410","label":0},{"index":5956,"txt":"It is just breathtaking in it is awfulness you really must see it!Depending on your perspective, Dylan Walsh is either the savior or the problem here since he is the only one on screen that can actually get his lines out with something akin to natural cadences and inflection, he either ruins the movie by pointing up everyone elses flaws, or he saves it by providing some context for their awfulness.I am inclined to the later view thanks to him, it works as high comedy. He is the 7 footer in a game of dwarf basketball, his skill set just does not apply in this context, and his discombobulation is delicious.The real treat though is Ms. Eastwood, whose inability to speak in plain English is so pervasive I actually googled her, expecting to learn that she was a Russian beauty who pronounced her lines phonetically, with no understanding of their meaning.

The idea was good, but the execution, acting, and dialog absolutely killed it, not to mention ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster sequences that was used to compensate for lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the movie.This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of earthquake. The rather cavalier reporter, going up against what should have been a more ruthless bunch of company execs, is chased around town along with anyone he speaks to in order to clean whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the plants faults.Unfortunately, there is no real sense of emergency because the characters interact with much hesitancy, coupled with idiotic dialog and a lot of horrible acting. Not to mention, the viewer, who may only be attracted to the movie for it is action genre appeal, is forced to endure a mounting body count and ridiculous amounts of violent shoot emups plus earthquake disaster scenes. All of the focus was put in the wrong place to apologetically compensate for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that should have propelled the story. It might have been much better had the filmmakers focused more on a thriller, and paid greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story. Creepy villains, a naive reporter, and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrongdoing afoot.

He also happens to be the best friend of the films hero. The plot is set up by the bomber as a computer game, with himself and the hero as players, and Seville as the virtual environment. The very real alleys and streets of the city begin to take on the labyrinthine qualities of those old Pacmantype games. Looked at this way, the scene where the hero and his female sidekick are chased by blackhooded penitents with rayguns may not seem as silly as it plays. From the start, we are aware that the narrative is being constructed as a game  the heros job is to create crossword puzzles for a popular newspaper; at one point, the crossword grid on his screen becomes the chessboard on which he is later playing against his girlfriends father. Clues are liberally scattered, as the camera mystifyingly closes in on images that are only later shown to have been significant e.g. the advert in the bar. The detectivepaper chase elements are made part of a game in progress, rather than an investigation after the fact. The film borrows heavily on Se7ens pattern narrative, and anyone with a Catholic education will presumably get the significance of certain events happening on certain days in the run up to EAster.In this reading, the game is on the level of narrative, with the hero fighting against an enemy in this case, the computer to win and save the day. But there is a second game, the film itself, which subvert the first. There are another set of of clues which point not to the killers intentions, but the filmmakers and his heros. In the first ten minutes there are references to chess, a writer called Navokov and a cult leader called Sarin. If we remember that the chessloving Nabokovs 1930s pseudonym was Sirin, we see another game afoot, one where we suspect not the villain, but the hero himself. In a Nabokov novel like Pale Fire, an authorfigure creates a text which is designed to hide his own motives, provoking a game between writer and reader to uncover the real text. Throughout the film are scenes which are visually distorted e.g. the image contracting, or which are ambiguously defined dreams and hallucinations that make us suspect the heros point of view. The opening references to games are all linked to him. In the early sequences, much is made of the characters sexual and creative impotence, so the film could be his attempt to master his life, to be a winner, in a way he cannot for real. No sooner has he won the game than his writers block vanishes; the words he types are the title of the film, suggesting he is the overall author. Further, that title in Spanish reflects on itself negatively, a very Nabokovian involution that suggests a hero, like Kinbote, trapped in his own solecism.This jumble of postmodern literature Borges, Eco, Pynchon et al are alluded to also, Fincher, XFiles, Run Lola Run, Chris Marker the idea of the city and its history as a map and a text; and as a cultural history haunting the present, Bunuellian anticlericism, and Alex de la Iglesias shock films result in a film that is just that, a jumble, each cleverclever allusive element cancelling out the last, dissipating interest. The lack of clarity about the games rules renders it incomprehensible, and eventually wearing. Ironically, in a work of such overdetermined artifice, the films main interest lies in its documentary quality, as a record of a narrative taking place in a real city with its own events taking place independently. Such an ambiguous blurring of fact and fiction can create a masterpiece like Sans Soleil or London, but, ultimately, you need to have a light touch to match your cleverness.","label":0},{"index":5972,"txt":"Holy crap!

The first theme, that of time travel, has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film, as well as the written word, most recently on the screen with yet another version of the H.G. Wells classic, The Time Machine. The second theme, which also manages to hold audiences in thrall, is that of invisibility, which sparks the imagination with it is seemingly endless and myriad possibilities. And this theme, too, has again become the basis for a film adapted from another H.G. Wells classic, The Invisible Man, the realization of which, here, is Hollow Man, directed by Paul Verhoeven, and starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue.Sebastian Caine Bacon and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the U.S. Government, exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility, which they have, at last, achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method. They have, in fact, progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured; their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original visual state of being. It is a problem, however, that Caine, after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab, has solved or so he thinks. And when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful, he decides to present the results to the board of directors, in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project.At the last minute, though, Caine demurs, fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level the testing of a human subject. And he takes it upon himself to become that subject, securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they have been given approval by the board to do so. But something goes wrong, and Caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility; and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it is too late, it all begins to take a toll on Caines mind. And suddenly, his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential, as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that. Now there is a very real chance that he may lose everything Including himself.Verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting, even thought provoking film; he establishes a good pace and uses the FX at his disposal to great effect, though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development. Anyone familiar with The Invisible Man, or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story, will know early on that Caine is not destined for happier times. Still, Verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience. But he seems bent on rushing toward the climax, and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful, opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless bloodandgore fest that betrays his audience and everything he is worked for earlier in the film. Rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to Caines suffering, and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it is inevitable conclusion, Verhoeven takes the low road, and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level, any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind, along with anything that would have made this a memorable film. And it is a shame, because Verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre, and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower.Kevin Bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable, if only on the surface, which seemingly serves Verhoevens purposes perfectly. There is little depth to Bacons portrayal, but it has more to do with his directors agenda than his own acting abilities. Verhoeven simply does not allow Bacon the time to develop Caine to any extent; the character is mainly a vessel around which Verhoeven can build his story, and toward that end, it works. The film would have been better served, however, had Verhoeven and Bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between Caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part, something that would have drawn them in a bit, rather than leaving them at the gate, as it were, as mere observers of an FX laden extravaganza.Elisabeth Shue comports herself well in the role of Linda McKay, Caines willing accomplice in the illfated experiment, but it is basically a thankless part that offers little challenge, especially to an actor of Shues caliber. The same can be said of Kim Dickens so magnificent in the 2001 film, Things Behind the Sun. Her character, Sarah Kennedy, does little more than support the action and FX. Both actors are capable of so much more, and deserve better than what they are given to work with here.The supporting cast includes Josh Brolin Matthew, Greg Grunberg Carter, Joey Slotnick Frank, Mary Randle Janice and William Devane Dr. Kramer. Entertaining to a point, and even successful on a certain low level, Hollow Man is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been. Like an annual fireworks display, it will give you some momentary thrills, but after awhile it will begin to blend in with all the others you have seen, without anything special to set it apart. And it is too bad, because given the talent and abilities of those involved here, it could have been so much more. I rate this one 410.

I would rather be raped by a pedophile than see this movie ever again!!! ugh!","label":0},{"index":5987,"txt":"OK, look at the title of this film.the title says it all right? the title is great... i mean, a lot of things should come into your head after readin it. in fact, you might be extremely anxious to see it.well, sadly, you will not see any of that.just a bunch of bad actors, some blood spilling, some hot chicks, and some lesbo action.oh, well, i think there are about 510 minutes of zombies and vampires indeed...get away from this if you want to see a good movie. else get it.","label":0},{"index":5988,"txt":"This is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression.. Story writing IS what movie making is about. Incredible visual effects.. Very good acting, especially from Shue. Everything is perfect.. Except.. The story is just poor and so, everything fails.Picture this, if you had the power to be invisible.. What would you do? Well, our mad scientist here played by Kevin Bacon could think of no other thing to do but fondle and rape women.. This is all his supposedly genius mind could think of. Does he try to gain extra power? No. He does not even bother research a way to get back to being visible. The guy is basically a sex crazed maniac.Add to that, the lab atmosphere, you have all these young guys.. Throwing around jokes like they were in a bar.. If it was not for all the white coats and equipment, you would think this is a bad imitation of Cheers. Very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but lambs for the Hollow Mans wolf.Even as a thriller, the movie falls way short because most of the thrilling scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming this is just a stupid thing I have to do so that the Hollow man can find me alone and kill me.If you read the actual book, while the Scientist Cane goes after women, there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character. In the movie, Cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded marketplace to rub his body in women and get off on it. Just sad.","label":0},{"index":5989,"txt":"As you may or may not have heard, there is no actual fighting between vampires or zombies in this film. One may then ask why the title suggested such a thing, but really it is kind of appropriate because nothing else about this film made any sense either. There was absolutely no story or plot, just things happening. The acting was incredibly bad, worse than safeauto commercials bad.Not only were there no fighting between vampires and zombies but I think there was only one scene with zombies even in it. Their make up looked as if it were applied by an 8 year old girl. The scene was totally random and out of place and featured one of the characters fighting the zombies off with a hedge trimmer I am not kidding but they used chainsaw sound effects.This was undoubtedly the poorest movie I have ever seen in my life. The only circumstance that I would not totally ridicule every person responsible for production of this film is if I learned that it was produced entirely by 11 year olds.Really though, even with all of the criticism I offer here, I would suggest watching this movie solely based on the fact that it may very well be the worst movie ever, and because of this is quite comical. Even just counting the flaws in it should keep you entertained.","label":0},{"index":5990,"txt":"Well...the movie was a fun watch. The main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by. Like vampires that walk in the sunlight. Though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies. A scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams Ow this hurts...It is really stuck. Then there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while. And there are random dream sequenes that really do not help with the plot. Come to think of it, nothing really made sense, but i just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect. Come to think of it the fight scenes were aweful, and the zombies were just fun to watch. Slowly as i write more of this I like this movie more. But you know, all in all you cannot expect Schindlers List but its a fun watch.","label":0},{"index":5991,"txt":"This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen!! There was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. I have seen some bad movies but this one takes it. There is no plot and most of the movie you are either fast forwarding the movie to get it done faster or you are wondering what the hell is going on because you cannot seriously think that someone thought of this movie and you are watching it. I feel sorry for anyone who has to sit through this painful hour and a half. Please take my advice and DO NOT WATCH this movie for I know you will think it is the biggest waste of time you have ever spent in your life.","label":0},{"index":5992,"txt":"As myself and my other half are big fans of trash horror we could not resist getting out a movie that contained both of the greats we were thrilled! However for a 2004 movie with a rip off cover of Freddy Vs Jason this is a disgrace! The worst film I have ever seen but worth a look for a laugh if you are able to sit through it!The acting is awful the effects...well I could do better on my camcorder in fact its so bad they only bothered to put make up on the zombies faces and left out neck, hands etc. No story line, weird flashbacks that make no sense and terrible script!you broke my tooth! from one vampire you broke my cigar was the response from the human who looked like uncle Jessie from Dukes crossed with Santa!","label":0},{"index":5993,"txt":"Vampires Vs. Zombies starts with the breaking news that the unidentified disease that is spreading across America leaves the sufferer with homicidal  cannibalistic tendencies... Travis Fontaine C.S. Munro  his teenage daughter Jenna Bonny Giroux listen to the radio as they drive along the isolated backwoods roads to try  escape the disease when Travis runs over a guy who I assume is meant to be a zombie. Slightly further down the road he stops to help Julia Brinke Stevens  her teenage daughter Carmilla Maratama Carlson who are waving at the side of the road, at this point there is also a third teenage girl named Tessa Melanie Crystal sitting in the back of Julias car bound  gagged. To me this situation would seem strange but Travis, like the trooper he is, takes it all in his stride  agrees to take Carmilla off Julias hands , well I do not know actually. So, with a complete stranger, Travis drives off leaving Julia  Tessa. Carmilla seems like a nice girl but she turns out to be a Vampire  she likes to bite people  turn them into Vampires, oh  she is partial to a bit of lesbianism too. Travis, Carmilla  Jenna continue to travel while some guy who calls himself The General Peter Ruginis who appears to be some sort of Vampire killer  probably has something to do with it all but the film is such a mess it does not really matter  I really do not know how to carry on this plot outline as my head hurts just thinking about it...Coedited, coexecutive produced, written  directed by the supremely untalented Vince DAmato Vampires Vs. Zombies is one of the worst horror films ever  therefore one of the worst films ever period. The script by DAmato was apparently based on a classic story entitled Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu he should sue  is an absolute mess, the holes in the plot  logic are so big you could drive a tank through them! What is the disease that turns people into zombies? Why is Carmilla a Vampire? Who is Julia to her? Who the hell is The General? What does he want? Where are Travis  Jenna going? How can Travis run a man over  yet not have the slightest bit of human emotion over it? What is with the mental ward at the end? There are also some confusing  unnecessary dream sequences just to annoy the viewer even more. There are just so many things wrong with this film, the narrative does not make a blind bit of sense, the concept is terrible  never really explained properly plus it is incredibly boring. I have not one positive thing to say about Vampire Vs. Zombies, not one. Forget about any Vampires fighting Zombies because it just does not happen, tell me again why is this film called Vampires Vs. Zombies?Director DAmato has served up one of the most incompetent, rubbishy, badly made, poorly thought out  excruciatingly painful viewing experiences ever made. Vampires Vs. Zombies really has no redeeming qualities at all, there is not one single aspect that I can praise. The gore is really fake looking, there are some blood splats which look like red water, some really cheap staking effects  a half decent climax where the zombies feast on Carmillas  Jennas intestines, this fairly gory scene is probably the best part of the whole wretched film but it only lasts for a couple of minutes  in no way makes up for the other turgid 85.The budget on Vampires Vs. Zombies must have been small, in fact did it even have a budget because most of it is set on a road in a couple of cars. This is one of the most badly made horror films it is been my misfortune to watch, the entire thing just sucks. The acting is predictably awful,  I mean awful.There is not much else left to say, Vampires Vs. Zombies is easily one of the worst films ever made. The V next to the title on the IMDbs main page for Vampires Vs. Zoimbies indicates that it went straight to video, well that is far too good for this pile of crap as it deserves to go straight on the nearest fire.","label":0},{"index":5994,"txt":"Okay, I have watched this movie twice now, I have researched it heavily on the net, I have asked several people on there opinions. I have even gone to the length of reading the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic Carmilla, a book that this movie is supposed to be based on. I feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it. As the plot of the movie does not seem to make any sense at all, here is the plot of the book.Laura lives in a castle in Syberia with her Father, Mr De Lafontaine. They carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully. One day they get a letter from the General a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death. He makes claims of supernatural powers being at work, and explains that he will visit them soon. Meanwhile, a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the Lafontaines looking after her Daughter, Carmilla, for several months. Soon Laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams, and begins to come down with a strange illness. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And just what has she to do with Lauras condition, and the General?I have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it, and let me know what their results are. I even have a catchy name, and would have a jingle too, but I cannot be bothered with that. It is called the this movie does not make any sense game.All you have to do is, whilst watching the movie, try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening. I mean complete, all questions answered, everything makes sense, absolutely complete.It will have to answer such questions as ...  Why can vampires walk around in day light? Why are they all lesbians? Why is a girl called Bob? and why does she shoot herself? When is the movie a dream and when is it real? Why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that does not make anyone bat an eyelid? Why does Travis Fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car, yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car, accept the excuse that she is a zombie too? And why does he then let a girl, which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire, drive with him in his car? And then let her drive off, alone with his daughter in a stolen car?What the hell is the asylum scene all about? What the hell is the green goo all about? Why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse? Why are there never any vampires fighting Zombies? What is the significance of the necklace? what is it made of? why does it kill vampires? and how does Jenna know that?In fact sod it, it is just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too.I have my plot, and I have to admit it is not quite there, but it is a pretty good effort.In ConclusionVampires vs Zombies has no moment in it where there are actually Vampires fighting Zombies. Everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on, yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this. And somehow it is based on a classic 19th century horror novel. How? Why? What the hell is going on?","label":0},{"index":5995,"txt":"After watching this thing, then reading the summary on the back of the DVD, then thinking back to actual movie....I became a bit dizzy. I thought, maybe I fell asleep and dreamed I was a down syndrome baby waltzing through a never ending forest where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop for no purpose other then occasional tasteless lesbianism. Where zombies? come out of nowhere and vampires? who seduce? pure hearted citizens on their way to save the world. Neither zombie nor vampire notably encounter each other. The only fighting i remember was getting that walrus Bonny Girouxs panties off. Coo Coo ca FAT! All of them! Maybe that was because we were watching it widescreen stretched and were too lazy to change it to its native resolution, but that actually made it more entertaining... In conclusion my trailing thought thesis had more continuity, plot, character development, antagonism, subject matter, and acting then the entirety of this film. It made Bloodrayne look like Citizen FING KANE","label":0},{"index":5996,"txt":"I am an avid fan of horrendous movies, anything cheesy and down right ridiculous is my game. So imagine my spirit I went to the local Rent Shop, and found Vampires vs. Zombies. The name is just too entertaining, you know that no one in the world could pull off something like it, it just has to be bad.And boy, is it BAD. After viewing this horrorific movie, I was speechless, literally. Me and my pal sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes, both of us contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the depressing silence with the words, ...dude....What? Yes, i am an enthralling individual.Heres a quick street review The Plot; There is none, at all, ever, constantly in WTF mode. The Characters; No development, forgettable. The Music; Worse than porn. The Vampires; Theirs vampires? The Zombies; Theirs Zombies?In the end; Everyone should see this movie, honestly, its so bad I yearn to see it again.

But I had no Idea what I was getting myself into.I started the movie and soon I had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture.I finally know what hell is like. It is this movie. For eternity. This movie has no value. It did not even really have a plot. There was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens.Instead of watching this movie I suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can. You will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie.Do not even watch it. Not even to see how bad it is. I beg you. If you watch it, then it means they win.","label":0},{"index":5998,"txt":"Dear me. Where do I start? The dad is not anywhere near old enough to be the girls dad. He corpses on camera in the first 5 minutes of the film. The favoured exclamation in this film is Jesus Christ!!!. Zombies are agile, stupid and few and far between. Motives are utterly incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist. People rush to their destination in jeeps driven at 3 MPH. The world seems to be carrying on as normal yet these are supposed to be the end days. Breasts appear for the sake of breasts. Normally such an approach would provide some redemption but the rest of the film actually made me uninterested in breasts or the future of humanity. There is a dog for no reason and thin, orange blood that turns the stomach. The General and his catchphrase of Shut the fk up! is the only redeeming feature. As for the rest, I sincerely hope to hear that they had done the decent thing and killed themselves.","label":0},{"index":5999,"txt":"Going into this movie you know that this is movie has six lab technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac. So right away you are guessing who will live and who will die. The survivors end up being exactly who you would expect them to be, so no points for plot twists there.And if you are not sure if this is a Bmovie or a movie that just happens to take place in a lab with an engaging story, William Devane plays a part instant Bmovie status.The movie is promising in the beginning. At the lab we are introduced to the invisible gorilla who is becoming increasingly violent. Oooh, foreboding. The best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again. Great special effects. Same thing when they make Bacon invisible.There are a couple of bare breasts, a really lame dirty joke and enough out of place swearing to give this movie an Rrating that it really did not need.For a thriller there were not really any surprises, except when Shue makes like MacGyver in the freezer, which is more of a Whaaaa? OK, there is one surprise. That is when Caine Bacon comes back one last time in the elevator shaft. It was a surprise but only because you are yelling at TV, Noooo! You are dead already! End the movie! Speaking of yelling at the TV,that is all I did for the last 25 minutes or so. Put on your fing goggles! Instead of putting their infrared goggles on so that they can see him, they try every other trick in the book fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems....The story really lost it at the end. But the special effects were good; that is the only reason I give it a 210.","label":0}]}
