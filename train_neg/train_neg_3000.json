Also, there is a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences.Well, the 1973 TV version of Double Indemnity has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original. The main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all. Fred MacMurray was great as the lecherous, leering insurance agent Walter Neff in the original; Richard Crenna just seems worldweary and tired. Edward G. Robinson brought great manic energy to his role as MacMurrays boss Barton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, a fine actor, appears almost bored with the proceedings. Samantha Eggar is all wrong as the conniving, backstabbing Phyllis Dietrichson; while Barbara Stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role, Eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place.Robert Webber, in the old Richard Gaines role as Robinsons boss Norton, and John Fiedler taking the Porter Hall role as the crucial witness, bring some life to the movie. In particular, Webber recreates the Norton role well in a 1970s context.However, after the movie starts, the whole thing just sort of lies there, without any life or electricity. This is one film that never should have been remade.","label":0},{"index":2004,"txt":"This 1973 TV remake of the Billy Wilder classic is inferior to the original. Surprise!First, the good things. Lee J. Cobb makes a terrific Barton Keyes. He is not as good as Edward G. Robinson, of course, but he is the only reason to watch this. This remakes only improvement over the original is that it cuts down the role of Lola Dietrichson, the stepdaughter of the femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson.And that is it for the good things.The bad things are many. The director records everything in an indifferent manner if you watched the film with the sound muted you would hardly get the impression that anything especially interesting was happening. Because of modern bad taste, the film must be in color instead of black and white. Because of 1970s bad taste, all the sets are distractingly ugly. Walter Neffs expensive apartment, in particular, is hideous.The modern setting hurts in a lot of small ways. Train trips were a bit more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s, so Mr. Dietrichsons decision to take a train seems more of a contrivance. Men stopped wearing hats, which prevents Walter from covering up his brown hair while posing as the whitehaired Mr. Dietrichson. Women in mourning stopped wearing veils, which robs Samantha Eggar of a prop Barbara Stanwyck made splendid use of in a key scene. Oddly, Lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and veil before she had need of them.Stephen Bochco keeps much of the Billy WilderRaymond Chandler script the same. But he makes a lot of tiny, inexplicable changes to the dialogue which leave the script slightly flabby where once it was lean and muscular. Outrageously, the famous motorcyclecop banter is gone, but look closely and you will see what looks like a postproduction cut where those lines should have been. Bochco may not be to blame.Richard Crenna is passable as Walter Neff. What might have made this version tolerable is a really splendid Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead we get Samantha Eggar, who comes off like a standardissue villainess from Barnaby Jones. But who can blame Eggar? With a director who barely seems interested in what is happening in front of the camera, how could Barbara Stanwyck herself have come off well?","label":0},{"index":2005,"txt":"Watch the Original with the same title from 1944!

That, to me and many others, is one of the greatest film noirs ever made. Realizing this is simply a shortened madeforTV film and that most people had trashed it, I did not expect much, but you cannot help but compare this with the 44 film. Scene after scene, I found myself comparing what I was looking at it, and remembering how it played out with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now I was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb.When it was all over, I found it was not as bad as I had expected but it is no match for the 1944 original. The two main areas in which this madeforTV film was not as good were 1 the electricity between the two leads was missing and 2 being only 90 minutes, they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot, characters and chemistry between those leads. Crenna and Eggar were flat, and simply no match for MacMurray and Stanwyck as Walter Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson, respectively.Where this remake held its own was in the other characters, such as Barton Keyes and Edward Norton. Cobb was terrific as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton, head of the insurance company. It also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed, so the houses, cars, telephones, dictating machines, etc., were all early 70s instead of mid 40s. Otherwise, the storyline was very similar, just rushed.However, one viewing was enough and I will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story and film.","label":0},{"index":2007,"txt":"When Samantha Eggar as Phyllis Dietrickson answers the door of her house swathed in a towel, you realize that as competent an actress as Eggar may be, she does not have the hypnotic allure of Barbara Stanwyck. And it is not entirely Eggars fault. In the original film, Wilder had Stanwyck not only appear in a towel, but she enters the scene on the second floor balcony of the house. And she does not come out; she appears, almost as if by magic. Walter Neff is staring up at her from below on the first floor. There is a reason for this. Stanwyck is much higher than Neff Fred MacMurray when they are first introduced. It is not just the towel. The towel adds to the seductive allure. Her pose is like a Greek Goddess overlooking her domain, and, in a strange way, you feel as if, from the start, she is actually controlling the entire situation. She has sexual, even magic, power. This person is no ordinary housewife. This person is a mystery with secrets hidden within.Back to 1973. The remake has Crenna knock on the front door. Stanwycks standin, Eggar, answers the door with a towel around her. There is no appearance. She simply opens the door. The alluring superiority that grabs the audience at the first appearance of Stanwyck in 1944 is entirely absent in 1973. She opens the door with a towel around her. It may be sexy in a Charlies Angels sort of way, but it is not nearly as mysterious. The filmmakers of the remake seem to misunderstand Wilders point. The script may have said Phyllis appears in towel so the filmmakers of the remake simply follow the instructions and include the required towel. The point is not the towel. The point is the enigmatic quality of Phyllis, and the potential power she wields. Wilder gave her a towel to add to her mystique. The filmmakers of the remake gave her a towel because that is what Wilder did. And in the choice of shot, lost all of Phyllis mystique.Richard Crenna also seems miscast. He seems like he is acting and not really in the midst of the dilemma. Part of the problem is Crenna appears so much like a 70s actor. He cannot get into the 1940s. When MacMurray first speaks into the microphone, sweat begins to drip from his face. No sweat on Crenna. And they also changed one of the crucial lines at the beginning. In the original, Neff says, I did not get the money, and I did not get the woman. In the 1973 version, Crenna says, I did not get the money, and I did not want the woman. Did the filmmakers completely misunderstand the entire point of the story? Or were they dumbing it down for a television audience?This madeforTV movie is a bythenumbers rendition. All the sharp edge of the original is lost. The only standout, maybe, is Lee J. Cobb in the role made famous by Edward G. Robinson. But he cannot save the loss of intensity of the original. This 1973 boring remake is a forgettable TVmovie made probably by the same people who did Gilligans Island. They might as well have tried to remake Citizen Kane or Gone with the Wind. If mediocrity is the best one can hope for, what is the point? The 1944 classic is a Film with a capital F. This madeforTV remake deserves an F grade, or, maybe a D for dumb.","label":0},{"index":2008,"txt":"This 1973 remake of the classic 1944 Billy Wilder film, Double Indemnity, is a textbook example of how to destroy a great script. This gradeB TV fodder also illustrates the folly of remakes in general. While Hollywood has gone after greedy executives that colorize blackandwhite films and sought disclaimers on widescreen movies that are shown in panandscan versions, the industry has ignored the hacks that insist on taking a classic film and diminishing it with a shoddy remake.The first step in producing a bowdlerized version of a classic is to edit the script. The BillyWilderRaymondChandler work was cut by a half hour to fit the finished film into a specified timeslot with room for commercials. Then update the production with bland, color photography, smart, upscale sets, and TVfamiliar actors. Thus, the brandnew Double Indemnity eliminates the atmospheric blackandwhite filmnoir cinematography that enhanced the mood and characterizations of the original. Gone are the dusty, shadowy, claustrophobic sets that explained the protagonists desires to escape their situations at whatever cost. Gone are the close bond between Keyes and Neff and the erotic attraction between Neff and Phyllis.The look of Jack Smights take on Double Indemnity is more Dynasty than film noir. Phyllis Dietrickson has a designer home to die for, and Neffs comfy pad would be hard to afford on an insurance salesmans salary, not to mention the sporty Mercedes convertible that he drives. Neither character has any apparent motive to murder for a paltry 200,000. If not money, then perhaps murder for love or lust? Not in this version. Richard Crenna shows little interest in Samantha Eggar, and their kisses are about as lusty as those between a brother and a sister. Crenna fails to capture the cynicism of Neff, and his attempts at doubleentendre and sexual suggestiveness fall horribly flat. Eggar is little better and lacks sensuality and the depth to suggest the inner workings of a supposedly devious and manipulative mind. Only Lee J. Cobb manages a creditable performance as Keyes. Director Jack Smight and his three principals have all done much better work.There was no conceivable reason to produce this wretched remake except to fill time in a broadcast schedule. There was no conceivable reason to resurrect this dud on DVD and package it with the original film except to fill out a doubledisc package. The only lesson that can be learned from this misfire is that even a great script and great dialog can be ruined with poor casting, lackluster direction, and TV grade production values. The 1973 Double Indemnity should be titled 10 Indemnity, because viewing it only underscores the 100 perfection of the original movie.","label":0},{"index":2009,"txt":"Bought this movie in the bargain bin at Rogers Video store for 2.

While there is still plenty to offend the masses, it is more likely to bore them, than arouse much real passion.

Once the sex and nudity begins, it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation, a looooooooong flashback to an alleged beauty and the beast encounter, and a naked woman running around the mansion nobody, even her supposedly protective Aunt, seems to even think of putting some clothes on her!. On video, I guess you can fastforward thru the banality, but it is not really worth the effort.

The Chief of Police even has one speaking line playing himself and boy, can you tell he cannot act. The reason for the amusement is that in this movie the police shoot first and ask questions later. Not the kind of PR, I would think a police force would want. Other than that, this is your standard cops and robbers film dressed up for the 70s with a racial angle. Alex Rocco is given a thankless role of a lifer cop that cannot get ahead and is saddled with a mentally ill wife. He makes up for this by hanging out at the local whorehouse. Hari Rhodes is his dashing partner that has a groovy wardrobe and likes to chase after suspects while wearing a trenchcoat. The movie moves along until the penultimate shootout that makes absolutely no sense why do people that are only guilty of a robbery, take on a whole police force?. Not only do we see one shootout but since there are four bad guys, we get to see four.

Well I had a similar sensation while watching this film. Okay, I did actually choose to go and see Aprile, and I knew about Nanni Morettis taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti the madre of all slaps. Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways. In Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a highpitched whine going on about how his politics are best, or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment. He also finds time to slag off films that he does not like, something I thought was reserved for losers like me. Surely being in a position like his you would think he would try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this. By making a proper film perhaps, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that is not completely dominated by his annoying voice. And when he started fawning over his newborn baby, I just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal, preferably not a selfobsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music. The next time someone you do not know tries to tell you their lifestory, give them a slap from me.

Moretti says he feels a need to make this movie, but does not want to, whereas the viewer feels that he should stick with it, but really does not want to either. A film about Italian politics and elections could be fascinating, but this is not that film. At one point, Moretti and his friends are standing outside the Communist Party headquarters, discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with Party leaders inside, but it is characteristic of this film that we never get to see anything of them. Interposed with Morettis political ravings are the events leading up to the birth of his son, and subsequent home movie shots of him with the baby and later the infant Pietro the film drags us through several years and more than one election period. We keep expecting to see some definitive sequence or cogent argument, but they never come. I for one doubt that I could have the patience to ever sit through a Nanni Moretti movie again.

Following a dispute with Anderson, Laurel continued the informal series of parodies at Joe Rocks smaller and more indigent production company.Most of Laurels parody films were only mildly funny at the time, and even less funny for modern audiences who have not seen the original movie which Laurel is parodying. West of Hot Dog is a fairly generic parody of cowboy shootemups. It is marginally a specific parody of West of the Pecos, an oater released two years earlier with no major actors. Since West of the Pecos was never a huge success, it is difficult to see why Stans film unit chose this particular movie as a target for their lampoonery, much less why they waited so long after its release to parody it. And where did they get that title West of Hot Dog? Possibly it is down to the fact that Hot dog! was a sexual interjection favoured by American lechers in the 1920s. As in the opening scene of the stage play Machinal. West of Hot Dog was produced and codirected by Joe Rock. Among his many other achievements, Rock introduced Laurel to Lois Neilson, and he was subsequently best man at their wedding. Full disclosure In the last years of his life, I had the great privilege of befriending Joe Rock and interviewing him. Nearly ninety years old at the time, Rocks memory was impressively clear ... but he remembered nothing at all about West of Hot Dog, and I cannot blame him. This movie is eminently forgettable.The leading ladys character is named Little Mustard If that is meant to be a parody of something in West of the Pecos, I do not get it. There are a couple of impossible gags here, including Laurels method for mounting a horse. For just one moment in this movie, Stan Laurel reminded me of the great Buster Keaton when he suddenly broke into a run. West of Hot Dog is vaguely similar in subject matter and tone to Keatons short comedy The Frozen North, but Keatons version is much funnier. The plot of this film somewhat anticipates a situation in Keatons feature Our Hospitality but again suffers by comparison here, two tough varmint brothers expect to inherit the Last Chance Saloon, but the previous owner has bequeathed it to weakling tenderfoot Stan. However, the brothers will become the legal heirs if Stan dies. Hmmm...Seriously, though is such a bequest legal? As soon as Stan takes possession of the property, surely any further questions of ownership or inheritance become his decision, not the previous owners decision. I had plenty of time to consider such points of law while watching this dull comedy.At one point, a gag involves some crude animation drawn directly onto the film stock. It looks cheap and is not funny.This Hot Dog is no weiner, and no winner it is just a whiner. My rating one point out of 10.

Suggested? It was nothing but a complete rip off of all the essential elements of the storyA wronged and sad old man, an artisan, poor and lonely, has all his money stolen. One night a child wanders up to his door as her mother lies dying in the snow outside. The man takes her in and brings her up until one day the local squire or rich politician here demands to adopt the child. It is he who has fathered the child during an illicit affair years before. The battle then ensues as to who should have legal custody of the child.In this and every other aspect of the film, the story is exactly the same. In only one can I find a difference. Silas Marner had epilepsy  but perhaps that would have strained the acting abilities of Mr Martin too far. On top of that he has his hair dyed in some carrot juice concoction presumably to make him look younger, but actually making him look more the clown that he is! There is also the addition of meaningless jokes, that this offbeat comedian cannot resist bringing into the story which have no part in it and only detract from the profoundness of the story. Like when the child cries in the courthouse declaring she can only be happy with the man who has fathered her all these years. This is conveyed in the film by the girl applying nasal decongestant to the bridge of her nose to make her tearful!I am surprised that legalities and integrity within the film industry permit such a film to be made. If I was a trustee of George Eliots I would insist on reparation. If I was Steve Martin I would send the profits to that estate, or to the poor.

The continuity mistakes were too big in number. Some were pointed out by the makers of this site others were not. I will not point out all of the others, but here are a few more to see When the young daughter leaves at the start of the film the catch to the cage door comes down and the hook part of it that is on the right clearly goes back around behind the round knob thus effectively making sure Roddy would not be able to get out and yet he does just by simply kicking at it. At one point the ruby falls down Roddys back and gets pushed straight up into the the air by Rita all the while the ship is moving forwards. In the next scene Roddy has caught it again.

Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected as Chaplin partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer; Joanna Lumley is compelling as novelist Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst is winning as Marion Davies though why movies never use her reallife stutter is difficult to explain. But these elements do not add up to a successful whole. The screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenesthe meetings between Davies and Chaplin are particularly well craftedbut not so hard on the big picture. Several minor characters do not need to be there, and do not behave consistently. The basic plot is full of illogic e.g., why does Thomas Ince think it is a good idea to tell Hearst something he really does not want to hear?, and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome. I would like to think a trip on Hearsts yacht was more fun than the movie indicates. Davies is characterized as a standard bubbly Flapper type, which is not really accurate, and the screenwriters ideas about Chaplin and love are implausible. Strangely, Bogdanovich, who seemed so connected to the Thirties in Paper Moon, lacks a similar affinity for the Twenties. He insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream, which gives the party guests a very artificial look, and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period e.g., Yes, We Have No Bananas.

I also did not like how the daughters relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her familys perversion or predilection for bestiality.

We are not empathetic with anyone. And the great Citizen Kane polishes off the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a much more convincing way. In The Cats Meow we are not ever sure of Davies motives for being with Hearst. As soon as we are told one thing, she is off doing the other.And are we to believe that Davies was the love of Chaplains life? Or is he just trying to cockold one of Americas most powerfuland apparently moroniccitizens. The film never makes it clear.What is convincing are the production values.

I got more out of looking at the construction of some of the lapels on the mens jackets than following a story that libels many of the the most wellknown personalities in Hollywood history.

Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material, but so much so that she seems to be distancing herself from the whole enterprise rather than narrating it. One of her first lines is, I am not here!

And who is making up all the calling cards with the serpent effecting a HSSS, with the words You will hear it cut and pasted beneath? Apparently, the hissing sound of a snake was the sound made by the apartment houses radiator system, which Peterson used to transmit a poisonous gas into the rooms of potential victims, such as Mrs. Coby in the apartment below Harker. But in answer to a question posed to Inspector Russell about Mrs. Cobys death, he replied apparently to the cause of strangulation.It is these rather conflicting plot points that made the movie somewhat unsatisfying for me.

However, I did not care for his mission to settle down, because I did not care for his character. I do not understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him. He had absolutely no class, or charisma. He should have at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing, but to no avail. Just because he is a musician does not make him sexy. Not to mention, the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous. Does this man have any shame whatsoever? Had he tidied up, and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character, but alas, his character was bland and boring.Gina Gershons character was unnecessarily British. She could have just as easily been an uptight outoftowner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor British accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie.The only two characters I cared for were the fish and frog.

But no one believes the romance between the main characters, and there is nothing funny to make up for that major shortcoming. Modine is way past being a leading man  especially a romantic lead. I am sure as Executive Producer, he had the means  but not the good sense  to cast himself. And Gershon...I see possibilities of some comedic talent, but she had no script and a poorly developed character. And whose idea was the English accent? Pointless.Others have stated it, but I want to repeat this story is poorly conceived, poorly executed; the actors are terribly miscast; and the characters, well, we just do not give a hoot about them.An art form this as not.

I do not know if she was thrown by the accent, or what. There was no chemistry between these two. And the girl Modine was in love with, suddenly she is shoving half a head of lettuce in her mouth and acting in a goofy way? Where did that come from?

It sounds forced and phony, much like her acting. She should stick to what she does best, lesbian showgirl conartist who plays in a rock  roll band and has a drug problem. The other characters are no better. They are two dimensional. empty, vapid and silly. How are we to supposed to care about these people. At one point Christy Scott Cashman gets lost in Central Park.

I am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look too deeply into this movie. I would not go so far as saying that it is a serious and dark exploration of such subjects as sexual frustration, longing, fulfillment, or satirical criticizing of the catholic Religion. I would not even call it a horrorerotic movie. It is more of the parody on all genres it touches or mentions even though it is got some shocking moments in all departments that sure will stay in your memory.The long way too long scene between an Aristocratic young woman and the supposedly horrifying but the most laughable I have ever seen in the movies creature with truly impressive...well anatomy, is set to the clavichord music of Scarlatti and is hysterical. My husband and I both laughed out loud at the exaggerated details of the encounter. The moral of the scene is  beauty can and will defeat the monster. The question is  who is the target audience for the film? For an erotic picture, it is too verbose; for an art movie  it is got too many jawdropping scenes of sheer madness and I would say an abrupt ending. IMO, the film creator did not mean for it to be a serious drama. As a parody of art househorrorerotica, it is funny and certainly original. Have a good laugh and try not to look for some deep meaning. This story of the curious Beauties and the lustful Beasts certainly is not recommended for coviewing with the children. The opening scene that may shock an unprepared viewer much more than the infamous scene of bestiality can be successfully used On Discovery channel for the program like In the world of animals  mating habits and rituals of horses.","label":0},{"index":2066,"txt":"If you have not figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes.

While checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never dared...the cabaret, where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfits while men throw money at her. The film is very misogamist. It is portrayal of men is dismal. Which is rather odd as Lilia stoops to jiggle around for them, not for money, but just for the hell of it. When she succeeds in arousing them it makes her feel like a woman again. She does not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention. The other dancers all are mostly aging women who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is shortlived. Not short enough I say. She does find romance, however brief , with you guessed it....No surprises here we did not see coming. Though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way.

It lived up to it is mediocre trailer run, though that is saying nothing at all. It did absolutely nothing that any movie before it has not done, and it played out in such a clich\u00e9 fashion that eventually I got to the point where I stopped laughing only because I was laughing with the audience, and instead let the humorless movie play out.So let us see... we have the lessthanspectacular main character that is trying to get back with his exgirlfriend but he is not good enough for her, check. We have the three buddies that all have their own personality with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl characters best friend but is constantly rejected, another friend being the super awkward one that cannot live down seeing the positive in everything 247 and is thrown in for the oneliners which in this case is just a bunch of movie references, specifically from Disney, and the third guy whose name you will not ever remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen... check. We have the girls exboyfriend and her parents block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up, not to mention the awkward family members from the main characters side... check. We have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed, check. We have the movies funny moments come from incessant swearing, people falling down or being hit, scenes from the trailer, and homosexual innuendos... check. And dare I call it a spoiler, but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie... check.Honestly, this could have... no, wait... should have been a PG13 movie. All that needed to be dropped were any Fbombs. Honestly, it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humor, would have gotten less media exposure, and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent Rrated comedies like Superbad and Knocked Up. The humor in this movie is just so awkward that it does not fit in with what general people look for. I bet even the actors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera. Let us put it this way... in the theater, it will help you laugh because it is on the big screen and others are laughing. When this movie hits Showtime and you are checking it out at 200 PM on an offday, you may be inclined to change the channel. The only thing that will keep you watching is Alice Eves hotness who is not quite a 10, but still very good looking.Aside from the main resolution, this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie, where everything else pretty much flies out the window. So there is a main resolution, but what comes of it? It is never really clearcut, nor does it allow the ending to be feelgood with the abruptness.There was only one thing worth nothing in this movie, and that was the good soundtrack. Aside from the nice choice of 90s alternative rock songs, there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie more so the beginning of it that reminds me of something David Holmes would mix upcompose. I will give them props for a great choice of sound.One last thing, this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer, because the inadvertent yet proud Pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that Rock Band promotion. I just figured a lot of Rock Band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it. But I say hold onto your money. If this was PG13 and you were 15 years old on a Friday night with a group of friends, I would say knock yourselves out. Otherwise, definitely pass. It does not try and compete with the Rrated movies of the past few years, and ideally it definitely is not as good.","label":0},{"index":2068,"txt":"This movie probably had some potential for something; my bewilderment is how these utterly prosaic unfunny themes keep making it to theaters, it is as if ideas are being recycled just because generations are.

This was not at all imaginative, there was no redeeming moment, anything remotely funny was shown in the trailer and nothing amusing was in the trailer, performances were strained especially Mollys, totally unconvincing. What was theoretically supposed to be some comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a penchant for Disney films; none of his analogies hit home, his little moral speeches were flat, I was literally waiting for them to go on to say something meaningful, only to find out he was done.

I thought that this movie was suppose to be great, but it was not more than a cheesy waste of time. I think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry, it just was not there. I think that if maybe we had a different actor play Kirk than Jay Baruchel it might have been better but the entire time I watched this movie he looked high and I did not get the feeling that he was not acting in this movie. Now, Alice Eve did a great job as an actress but, there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie. The humor in this movie was not funny at all, there were a few one liners in this movie that were OK but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand.

Growing sexuality in a woman? I have seen great films on this subject, but this is not one of them. How can one attempt to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person not only as a narrative device to dream in the nude of beasts. Where there are no characters, there is no character study. The woman persecuted by the beast was not adolescent, the girl having sex with the black butler is he also characterized as a beast? has a very grown up attitude to sexuality, so where is the consistency? Is it a movie about religion? If yes we would need a bit more thematic material than a priest without function, character and charisma, but with a strong desire towards two young boys.Is it about bestiality? The metaphoric feel of the movie forbids any realistic examination of bestiality, especially as realistic examination requires realistic characters. So no real bestiality here. Some mythic beast and two priests talking to each other about the sin of bestiality. Enough for a college essay on the topic? I do not think so.Is it about sex? Is it about anything? I do not know. I only know that showing a fired gun does not make a film a war movie. Dealing with a topic must mean more than displaying its own associations with the theme.So look across the controversy. Do not be scared by the bestiality, nudity, ejaculations, masturbation and stuff. I am not. Look at it as you look at any other story and you might discover that this is a poorly made, poorly edited, poorly acted, really poorly written okay, some pictures are quite nice, and the main character is a really good looking girl cerebral masturbation of a director who thinks beating around the bush in a hypnotic slow manner will make a story intelligent.

The plot about mailing the 17 letters was fine at first, until Joshs look at me, I am wacky approach began infesting each and every scene. The Judas Priest joke may have been the least funny thing I have ever been privy to, and that is saying quite a bit, since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie.

Blockbuster and IMDB even had it as an also recommended selection if you liked Office Space.Now, I have seen Office Space probably 15 or 20 times. I love it. It is probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Witty, humorous, and featuring characters that remind me of people I have worked with over the years. Haiku Tunnel is similar to office Space in that they are both films. That is where the similarity ends. We sat through probably the first 50 minutes of HT, giving it the benefit of the doubt, hoping, nay, praying that it would get better. It did not. We could not take it any more, and stopped the tape. Thank GOD it was a free rental. I would have been ped if we would actually paid for it. We should be reimbursed for having to sit through it. Now, since we did not see the end, perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself. I doubt it.Haiku Tunnel is so bad it is hard to believe it ever got produced. The movie is SO unfunny it is painful. Just mail the friggin letters already!!! The premise is asinine. The jokes are awful. We got as far as the printer does not work scene and had to stop. We could not take it anymore. This film is an EMBARRASMENT for Josh Kornbluth.If you are a fan of Office Space......do not waste your time with this turd. 010","label":0},{"index":2087,"txt":"Nope, I am just not going to get with it here. I refuse to go along with the program. Do not you supposed that perhaps this movie is just a tad overrated? Look at the reader comments and their star ratings Most are 610, 710 or better. I think this is an instance when the ratings may say more about the people rendering them than the movie itself, which is unique. How many other sex fantasies about simulated bestiality complete with horse couplings have become mainstream hits as catalog DVD titles? I watched this movie with a pervading sense of anticipation, expecting fireworks, and instead got someone popping a Gucci shopping bag. It looked great, but once the thrill had been spent even the twist ending did not do much to save it.The films background story says it all Director films about 25 minutes of borderline hardcore fake bestial sex for another movie, is informed the footage will not be appropriate, sets it aside, waits two or three years for a smattering of critical acclaim to build up, then constructs an entire feature around that 25 minutes, filming roughly 70 minutes of otherwise unrelated, excruciatingly boring footage and inserting the 25 minute chunk in as a dream sequence. That the 25 minutes of film in question is strikingly odd, original and shocking in a deliberate, calculated manner goes without saying. But we are not here to evaluate that 25 minutes alone, we must consider the entire film, and ask ourselves why people are so enthusiastic about the movie? Or are they just enamored by it is background story and history of having been banned by people who were stupid enough to be offended by it?Perhaps it is an anticlerical agenda that appeals to them. Hating the western religions of catholicism and Christianity is one of the few remaining socially acceptable bastions of intolerance  Just today it was revealed that the BBC routinely skews their broadcasts with anti Christian  anti Western sentiment in the furtherance of political correctness. You can say anything you want about the Bible, pedopheliac priests, the institutionalized cruelty of the church, and how much white men and their inhuman religions suck the dimpled skin off a golf ball ... But say one negative thing about nonwesternized religions, and you are toast. This movie was tailor made for such a sentiment, with a wrinkly old dried up priest who has an entirely unwholesome on screen relationship with two pretty 14 year old French boys complete with inappropriate touching, fawning, fondling, fumbling, groping, and patting of the backsides. Ewww.And then there is the horse couplings, photographed in such fetishistic closeup detail that portions of the film could be used as visual aids for a biology class on animal husbandry. Yes I understand the thematic relevance of the imagery  large animal phalluss with a wealth of reproductive fluids just waiting to be unleashed like fire extinguishers  but if I wanted to watch horses, you know, do it, I would like go live on a farm. Having their genitals in my face is about as entertaining as watching someone use a bathroom.Is this movie just a sort of artsy diversion for social deviants? Probably, though I will grant the artistic execution of most of it, filmed in a kind of arty Euro detail that even has a dappled forest pond right out of a Monet painting, complete with a spanning arched bridge. And the ending which even I managed to be surprised by does sort of wrap it all up into a neat if distasteful package. But you have to remember that there are certain things that cannot be deconstructed for their design elements and many artists are guilty for exploiting them in their work to lend a sort of gravitas that would not have been achieved without it. That is not fair, and even Clint Eastwood has fallen prey to the urge with his new movie about Iwo Jima. Whether or not his film is any good stands as a separate consideration from whether or not that battle was a noble cause fought by men who were heroes. The problem is that most people will not be able to separate out the two aspects of the movie and will be lining up to give it Oscars because of it is noble message  not because it is a particularly good or original movie.While it may seem like an odd parallel, I see one with THE BEAST How can anyone not see the basic beauty of nature in the sight of two horses mating? And who cannot see the logical culmination of the repressed sexuality from fairy tales in the films explosive setpiece where Beauty and the Beast finally do the nasty? Somehow I managed to miss both points, and am delighted that I have seen this film so that I can trash it as being what it really is 25 minutes or so of eye opening over the top adult fairy tale imagery surrounded by 70 minutes of skull drainingly boring artsyfartsy Euro Trash dreck about some guy getting a haircut, and a great ending. It is art for sure, but it sucks hard.310","label":0},{"index":2088,"txt":"Office work, especially in this era of computers, multifunctional copy machines, email, voice mail, snail mail and temps, is territory ripe with satirical possibilities, a vein previously tapped in such films as Clockwatchers and Office Space, and very successfully. This latest addition to the temphumor pool, however, Haiku Tunnel, directed by Josh Kornbluth and Jacob Kornbluth, fails to live up to it is predecessors, and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door, waiting for a chance to sneak in. Unfortunately for the audience, that chance never comes; so what you get is a nice try, but as the man once said, no cigar.\tAs the narratorstar of the film, Josh Kornbluth playing Josh Kornbluth, points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera, this story is pure fiction, and takes place in the fictional city of San Franclisco. It is an innovative, if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer, and not all that funny. It is, however, a harbinger of what is to follow, all of which like the disclaimer just is not all that funny.\tKornbluth plays Kornbluth, an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp. It is a job that suits him, and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time. But when he goes to work for a lawyer, Bob Shelby Warren Keith, he does too good a job on the first day, and Shelby dispatches head secretary Marlina DAmore Helen Shumaker to Kornbluth to persuade him to go perm. The thought of working full time for the same company, though, initially strikes fear in the heart of Kornbluth, but he caves in and signs on for the position. He is nervous about it, but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which, of course, they would never do with a temp, and if things get too rough, he has seventeen important letters he is typed up that now just have to be mailed out to fall back on he is been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part, and he needs that something easy to do in reserve, in case it all gets to be too much for him. These are important letters, however, and by the end of the week, Kornbluth still has them in reserve, on his desk. And it does not take a genius to figure out that when Shelby finds out about it, Kornbluths days as the fairhaired boy are going to be over. And quick.\tThe Brothers Kornbluth, who not only directed, but along with John Bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film, should have taken a page out of the Ben Stiller Book of Comedy, where it says If you play it straight, they will laugh. But, they did not, and the audience will not. Because in comedy, even looking at it as objectively as possible, when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters, in this case Plays funny as in, he knows he is being funny he never is. And that is exactly what Kornbluth does here; so rather than being funny, he comes across as insincere and pretentious, a grievous error in judgment on the part of the Kornbluths, because by allowing it, they sabotaged their own movie. \tIn trying to discern exactly why this movie does not work, it comes down to two basic reasons The directing, which if not necessarily bad is at least careless; and secondly, the performances, beginning with that of Josh Kornbluth. Quite simply, Kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here. Unlike Stiller, or even Steve Martin both of whom use selfdeprecating humor very effectively Kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light; he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he, the real Kornbluth, is in reality much more clever than Kornbluth the character. And being unable to get past that does him in, as well as the film. Rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify, Kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach. So what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting, and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with, with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter, it is easy to understand why this one just does not fly.\tThe one saving grace of the film is the performance by Warren Keith as Shelby, whose subtle delivery is convincing, and which in and of itself is fairly humorous. The effectiveness of it is diminished, however, inasmuch as Keith has to share his scenes with Kornbluth, which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project. \tShumaker and Sarah Overman Julie Faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances, which are commendable, if not entirely memorable; they at least make their scenes watchable, and Overman even manages to elevate Kornbluths performance, if only momentarily. But it is still not enough to save the day or the film.\tThe supporting cast includes Amy Resnick Mindy, Brian Thorstenson Clifford, June Lomena DaVonne, Joe Bellan Jimmy the Mail Clerk, with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking Harry Shearer, as the Orientation Leader a role that begs for an answer to the question, What was he thinking when he agreed to this? In any work environment, there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someones comedic cannon, and the films depicting said situations will always be with us; the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right. Haiku Tunnel, however, will doubtfully remain very long amongst them, for it is destiny lies elsewhere in a realm known only as Obscurity. I rate this one 110.

The other night it was on one of the movie channels, and I tuned in. I missed nothing.I must admit that I only watched the first 30 minutes. Perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that. Given the slow, plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30, I seriously doubt it.The lead character starts the movie in classic I do not know how to start my movie style, with a long, tiresome monologue about how he does not want to get sued. It is not funny. It is not even remotely funny. Others have commented on the San Franclisco bit; ok, a small chuckle the first time he says it. Then he grinds it into the ground, smiling at the camera like it is the funniest thing ever written. Get over yourself. In fact, I think the talking to the camera bit was the reason I instantly disliked the film. Do not assume familiarity with your audience. Familiarity is _earned_, much like respect.From there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp. I did not realize he is Jewish; it is a discredit to Jewish comedians to call this Jewish humor. It is just unfunny humor. Just because you are Jewish does not mean you have a knack for the comedy. A WASP, Spalding Gray, does a better job of selfanalytical humor than this guy, so obviously it is not about ethnicity.If one of the bits I had seen had worked, I might have stuck around. But some schlub going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with, then listing them for five long minutes, does not make a great movie.This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Office Space.

Suddenly, he is offered the chance to go perm, which seems to be the favorite catchphrase of this movie. But with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp, Josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he does not want to do it. He hopelessly bungles several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt. His inability to send several very important letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious, but is merely stupid.

A bunch of other stuff happens, but it is too trite and inane to go into now.Despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy, I only laughed twice during it; the first time was the opening shot of Josh Kornbluth my initial reaction was one of stifling fear and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman yeah, right. Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifyinglooking person I have ever seen in my life. He is an unattractive, overweight, balding Jewish man who I am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women. I do not at all sympathize with Joshs character.

The worlds largest, most exclusive inside joke.Emulating the brash and everyman humor of office space, this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books. The audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary, and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist.The entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time, listening to music and writing a novel while working. These are his goals. You cannot imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when around halfway through they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria, but then gives it UP! The director and screenwriter Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth completely remove the audiences motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereof.Apart from that major stumbling block, the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen. Without these asides, the audience would not have noticed anything particularly strange. Humor is only effective if it does not need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny.","label":0},{"index":2093,"txt":"I will dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic New Yorker persona, because quite frankly, to draw comparisons with bumbling loser Josh Kornbluth, is just an insult to any such director.

I can, however, compare it to waking up during your own surgery \u0096 it is painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what they are doing.

It was cruel to let it live and as a result, audiences around the world are being made to suffer.The films premise \u0096 if indeed it has one \u0096 is not even worth discussing, but for the sake of caution I will. Josh Kornbluth, a temp worker with severe commitmentphobia, is offered a permanent job. His main duty is to mail out 17 high priority letters for his boss. But ludicrously, he is unable to perform this simple task. My reaction? Big deal! That is not a story\u0085 it is a passing thought at best  one that should have passed any selfrespecting filmmaker by. The leading actor \u0096 if you can call him that \u0096 is a clumsy buffoon of a man, with chubby features, a receding, untamed hairline, and a series of facial expressions that range from cringemaking to plain disturbing. Where o where did the director find this schmuck? What is that you say\u0085\u0085 he is the director? Oh, my mistake. Playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing, but I suspect that Mr Kornbluth is not that convincing as a human being, let alone an actor. Rest assured, this is by no means an aimless character assassination, but never before have I been so riled up by an actors onscreen presence! My frustration was further confounded by his incessant tocamera monologues in between scenes. I mean, as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel, Kornbluth insults us further by explaining the action first rule of filmmaking dramatize exposition\u0085 show, do not tell. Who does this guy think he is? He has no charisma, no charm, and judging by his Hawaiian shirts, no sense of style. His casting agent should be shot point blank!The supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom I felt, with but one exception. Patricia Scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as Helen the exsecretary, who has been driven insane by her old boss, and makes harassing phone calls from her basement, while holding a flashlight under her face. This did make me chuckle to myself, but the moment soon passed and I was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the film.The films title is also a misnomer. Haiku Tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry.

That could even be a metaphor for this secondrate King Kong movie from Toho studios stalwart director Ishiro Honda. Essentially it is a warm up for King Kong versus Godzilla. It even uses the idea of a MechaKong, like MechaGodzilla. Of course the movie climaxes with King Kong fighting MechaKong on top of the expo tower in Tokyo, but if you did not know that already then maybe you are in the age group that this movie was intended for.The cast is headed by a guy named Rhodes Reason who we had never heard of... glancing over his list I see mostly a lot of scattered American TV credits, so it is interesting that they dragged him all the way to Japan so that they could have a nominal American hero. The real hero of the movie is the more sensitive Japanese commander played by Akira Takarada, who I recognized from Hiroshi Inagakis iconic version of Chushingura 47 Ronin and also from the original Godzilla films by Honda. I am sorry Rhodes Reason whoever you are, but this guy has way more screen presence and you can bet that everyone wants him to end up with the cute little blonde, played by Linda Miller. We laughed at the way Reason would always find a way to interject himself between Miller and Takarada, who it seemed like she kind of preferred. Of course like all Kong leading ladies her primary relationship is with the King himself. She discovers a nice trick if you talk to a giant ape really..... really.... slowly..... he will understand what you are saying. And if you are a blonde gal, that means that he will do whatever you tell him to do. That fact is not lost on Dr. Who Eisei Amamoto and Madame Piranha Mie Hama  representing a nation which shall not be named  who plan on using her as bait to get Kong to dig up mineral deposits that are trapped at the North Pole.Yes, this is truly the plot of the whole movie  apparently only a giant ape is going to be capable of digging out these minerals which can be used to make super powerful weapons. Dr. Who builds MechaKong to get it but the circuitry gets in the way, so they decide to go for the real Kong. Kong himself seems momentarily infatuated with MechaKong, a story element that might have made the film more interesting but was not followed up on.By the end of the movie, the cute blonde has shouted Kong or King Kong in her chirpy voice so many times that when the two heroes tell her to let him go at the end they are speaking for all of us. Basically this movie squanders whatever majesty was possible in the Kong character by making him a heroic and friendly figure much too early, just like the newest version of the story. Kong is just a guy in a suit in this movie, and they show quite a lot of him to the point where the goofy face becomes impossible to take seriously. It is a nice looking movie, I am sure it satisfies the demands or desires of fans of this type of thing, which is really more of a wrestling film than a monster film in a lot of ways. The monsters do not ever really scare in these films, they just jump around and push each other around a lot. It is not a worthless movie, but it is extremely predictable and formulaic so for anyone under the age of 10 or so it probably will only be entertaining as comedy.","label":0},{"index":2102,"txt":"May Contain SpoilersA dude in a dopeylooking Kong suit the same one used in KING KONG VS.

Everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic, and we all love him for it. But in Circle, he appears to be going more for irrelevant than funny, and completely lost me in places. Many of the topics he covers he has covered before  I even think I recognised a few recycled jokes in there.If you buy the DVD you will find a behindthescenes look at Eddies tour interesting in places, but not very funny, and a French language version of one of his shows. Diehards will enjoy seeing Eddie in a different language, but subtitled comedy is not very funny.If you are a fan of Eddie you have either got this already or you are going to buy it whatever I say.

She does not have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you are millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call.

One could interpret that it is actually mocking religion for in the Land of Plenty with all of its material excess, the best an organized mission can do is hand out a bowl of soup and a bible verse.

They need selfrespect, selfworth, dignity which you cannot give a man. Yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available.

TWO HARBORS is a BW 75 minute film from Minnesota that features nonactors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life. I applaud the boldness of the Reel 13 programmers of thinking outofthebox when selecting this film. I just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with. As a matter of fact, I wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself Not that TWO HARBORS is completely without merit, but I will get to that a little later. As is common with independent films, TWO HARBORS is limited in terms of location. There are only two real locations \u0096 a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer, which is the home of the middleaged main character, Vic, played by Alex Cole. Writerdirector James Vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about Vic, who is one of the dealers there. He has various people walk up to Vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information \u0096 Vic sells space toys he prefers to call them outer space action figures and he is a caustic asshole. This is emblematic of one of the two key problems with TWO HARBORS  all the chatting. I have said it before and I will say it again \u0096 we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually. There are exceptions, of course, but generally, endless patter is not so engaging on film \u0096 particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition. Pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose. A notable example would be a few scenes which feature Vic trying to play himself off as a Boy Scout leader in order to get a discount at a store. He argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes do not even advance the plot one iota. This is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel long.The other problem with TWO HARBORS is the acting. I may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film, but I really do not feel like there is a good excuse for not having good actors in your films. There are plenty of good actors out there, many of which willing to work on lowbudget projects \u0096 even in Minnesota. Many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals, but that is na\u00efve. In narrative filmmaking, next to the story, nothing is more important than the actingperformances. If you do not believe the people enacting your story, your audience is lost.Originally, I thought Vculek was using nonactors, but as the film went on, I decided that they were probably community theatertype actors. It was not that they were uncomfortable on camera. It is that they were overly theatrical i.e. big. Granted, the best of the actors were the two leads \u0096 Cole and Catherine E. Johnson as Cassie, a lonely young girl that gets caught up in Vics extraterrestrial hunt. They seemed to have the most training, but they were still a little rough around the edges. The eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only  not coming from a real, organic place within. Ms. Johnson, in particular, is an interesting case. She definitely has a presence \u0096 a Midwestern charm about her, but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have. She struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and slave? labor, relying on stock gestures like eye rolls, lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside world.I mentioned in the first paragraph that TWO HARBORS is not completely without merit and heres what I mean. Without giving too much away, there is a fade to white an hour into the film. After that, the story takes a stunning turn, which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful \u0096 it is like a sucker punch to the gut, but in a good way. It is almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters. The last five minutes of the film do not have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film \u0096 subtle, detailed Cole does his best work of the film and most importantly, cinematic. Then, with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all \u0096 that it is based on a true story, which got me to thinking. With all the dialogue, the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities, it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening rewrite, TWO HARBORS might make a really kickass stage play \u0096 maybe even a oneact. If there are any bold theater producers out there reading this, I definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker, Reel 13 or whomever. There might be something to this story after all\u0085For more information on this or any other Reel 13 film, check out their website at www.reel13.org","label":0},{"index":2120,"txt":"I think I found the most misogynistic film of all time Darklight.The gist of the film Lilith was Adams first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of Eden because she considered herself Adams equal and refused to submit to him.

The car blows to pieces before she even lands on it. The special effects were quite obviously my biggest beef with this movie. But what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility, and lack of reason for so many elements! For example, the antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to inflict harm in bizarre ways, happens upon a lone army truck transporting an important VIP. Nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck, you know they are already dead. Then the guy protecting the VIP says Under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?

The sequences just seem bland for something made in 2004.The CG features very nicely rendered and animated effects, but they come off looking cheap because of how they are used.Pacing everything happens too quickly. For example, Elle is trained to fight in a couple of hours, and from the start can do backflips, etc. Why is she so acrobatic? None of this is explained in the movie. As Lilith, she would not have needed to be able to do back flips  maybe she could not, since she had wings.Also, we have sequences like a woman getting run over by a car, and getting up and just wandering off into a deserted room with a sink and mirror, and then stabbing herself in the throat, all for no apparent reason, and without any of the spectators really caring that she just got hit by a car and then felt the secondary effects of another, exploding car...

The ghost comes back and wants his killer to live as a Jew to atone for the murders he committed.Otto, the German policeman actually knows this ghosts name because, the last thing he did before he died was said, in Yiddish, Kiss my ass. The policeman did not speak Yiddish, so he asked around until he found the meaning. The kiss my ass left such an impression that everybody involved with that killing learned and remembered the comedians name, Genghis Cohn.There are a bunch of men who are murdered in the jurisdiction of the police commissioner, and there are no helpful clues. The men are murdered with a set of knives that are missing from the local butcher. The butcher announces that his knives are missing while the commissioner is in the store to get a liver and onion sandwich, so the commissioner is a suspect. The first man is killed while making love to the butchers wife, so the butcher is a suspect. But the butcher maintains that he would be very busy if he killed every man that slept with his wife. All the men are killed immediately after the climax of lovemaking.I think I might be a bit angrier than the ghost of Genghis Cohn if I was killed like he was. He seems to be very goodnatured about it, as if he was just in a mild car accident. I can only guess that it is because it is a British movie and they are known for being a very polite people. He uses some of his material from his standup routing, and I just did not find it very funny.I gave this movie a 4 because it was just kind of goofy. I thought it should have been a little more serious than it was. The movie turns out to be a murder mystery where did this come from?, and it seemed that Genghis should have been more helpful than he was. The movie gave me a tiny look into Jewish culture, but was only skindeep. Do all Jews love liver and onion sandwiches? Do they all say shtoop and meshuganah in their daily vocabulary? Is not there more important stuff that we should know about the culture?I saw this movie at a Jewish community center in Berkeley, CA, and I was the only person in the room whose hair was not fully gray or white. I have no gray or white hair. There were 18 of us, and after the movie they stayed for about 20 minutes to discuss the movie. There were 2 main concerns expressed there 1. The movie was way too lighthearted and future generations might not understand the gravity of what happened and 2. As the Holocaust survivors are dying off, future generations will not know what really happened.

The final point comes short and the ending seemed kind of unsatisfactory after all that happens; a bit like real life in that respect but movies unlike real life ends in about 2hrs and the ending should leave the audience satisfied, if indeed that was the directors intention. This falls short in that respect and that is what disappoints me the most.Another aspect that concerned me was the national stereotyping of the American characters  they all seem to be carved out of the same block. Seems to me that most American characters in Indian English movies are based upon how common Indians themselves perceive Americans to be like and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any American in the movie.These two aspects put together they make for a disappointing story.","label":0},{"index":2131,"txt":"this has got to be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself.I first saw the trailer in 1991, it looked great.Since then i have always wanted to see it but could never find it.....until today, yes, 14 years later.lets just say I was so disappointed its unreal, OK i knew it would not be an Oscar winner but still had hopes that it would be a fun nobrain film in the bloodsport mold.

Jean Crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy; indeed, the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy  doubtless the Hays office insisted. Premingers direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal.

Aimed at the very young kids, this movie will bore you to tears. If the Gamera trilogy of the 90s raised the bar, this film just lowered it. It is slow paced and the monster fighting is good, but seldom seen. This movie had me dry heaving in the cat box. Just a very poor offering after a phenomenal 90s series.SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top 10 reasons Gamera fans of the 90s series will HATE this film.10. This movie is a drama that follows a kid trying to cope with the death of his mother and fears losing baby Gamera to a fight after knowing his father saw the adult Gamera die.9. You see the adult Gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the film. He gets his butt kicked by a few Gyaos and self destructs??? He looks old and lethargic. Plus he looks nothing like any gamera you have ever seen. His suit looked cheap and rushed.8. The young Gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a Pokemon. Bigeyed and cute...it will remind you of the baby Godzilla from Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera is now too cute.7. This movie has the pace of watching a NASCAR race during a 3 hour rain delay. I watched this movie with 2 other Gamera fans and nobody was happy with how slowly this film moved along. I have seen an SUV full of fat people going up a mountain road move faster.6. Like GodzillaFinal Wars, this movie had very little kaiju time on screen. Final Wars had much more, actually, and better fights although short.5. Kids take the title role. The friend of all children theme and poor writing killed the original Gamera series in the 1970s and history repeats itself in the 2000s. The most successful Gamera films abandoned the Sesame Street feel and went to a darker place. Why go back to a failed formula? This was to be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue thank god.4. Gamera lost his iconic roar. He now sounds like an Elephant with strep throat.3. This movie may produce a new Olympic event.....Imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children into harms way. You have to see the ending to understand this point. Where were the parents? Oh yea..right there sending their kids into a kaiju battle zone.2. The special effects were good, but subpar for a Gamera movie. Legion and Iris had better effects. The best effect was showing the apple sized baby Gamera fly. Not too impressive.1. This movie is just not what adult kaiju fans come to expect. The director was involved in Power Rangers and it shows. It comes off like a cross between ET, Always Sunset on Third Street and TMNT.

The plot, when not dealing in clich\u00e9s, rambles to the point of nonexistence; dialogue that is supposed to be street is simply hackneyed; characters never develop beyond sketches; setpieces are clich\u00e9d. Worse, considering its codirector, the photography is only soso.Comments elsewhere that elevate this alongside Get Carter, Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser are way way off the mark; Lives of the Saints lacks their innovation let alone their depth and shading. In short, their craft. A ruthless editor could probably trim it down to a decent 30minute short, but as it stands it is a 6th form film project realised on a millionpound scale; rambling and bloated with its own pretensions.

I was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere, but it gets bogged down in a story that goes pretty much nowhere.Othello works for big, fat Mr. Karva, his crimeboss stepdad at least I think that is what he is supposed to be because it is never really defined, but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers, so trust me, he is a prick doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy handjobs. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black dude who is always dashing from A to B. Until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running. Runner dumps the lost boy in Othellos flat, where he promptly starts granting more wishes. Keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled, Karva has the boy kidnapped. But he is not sure of what would really bring him happiness. Is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another handjob? Either way, I do not want to see the little boy grant him the second.It just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes. The ending tries to be shocking but since there is hardly any backstory on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience.Writer Tony Grisoni, a favourite of Terry Gilliam, tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell, ironically. If he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film. As it is, we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy. Who is origins are never revealed.

However due to the presence of an Olympic kickboxer Olivier Worlds lamest actor Gruner named Jacques, hope is on the way. Angel Town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made And I have seen my share it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need, are French kickboxers who cannot act. Worst of all there are so many awkward moments it is just truly hilarious. Best of all comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is. To Wit You like the fighting? Olivier grabs his Asian best friend in a headlock I could kill him right? When I want him dead he dies! The reason why I do not want him dead is because i am afraid of him, and I know that if I kill him his son and wife will kill me, that is why he does not die! Of course the fact that it is wrong to kill someone, let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation. Odd.However do not let me make this sound that I hated this movie, far from it, it is so terrible it is priceless. The biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees Grunner going one on one with gangmembers who the films biggest logic gapdecline the use of pistols. Also a handicapped Vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs, while Gruner kickboxes the rest. All of this set to the sound of horrible Mexican accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as this.The other treat about this movie, is that for some reason Olivier Gruner never attends college despite that is the main reason he is here in the states and not in France getting it on with his girlfriend In a graveyard in the films awkward beginning Angel Town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level, this is the perfect movie for you.

My friend showed me this film because he had seen Gruner in, what he called a pretty good scifi film, Nemesis.

And kick! hahaGruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one that he grew up in. He finds himself watching after the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join in the Mexican gang that keeps tormenting his family. Instead of joining up, Gruner tells the boy to fight back against a gang? too crazy. Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character who kills everyone or maims them pretty bad and works to rid his block of these gangmembers.The plot was very cheesy and easy to think of. Gruner is probably not very well known because of his scriptchoosing if this movie is anything to compare possible choices to. This ghetto is pure hell and I enjoyed seeing the motley crew of characters go through it as if they have a chance against Gruners character. The music was typical action music thumping pianos and timpani, swelling guitars which actually was not as bad as I make it sound. The director really needed to keep the action going instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a tense family moment.Ultimately, I gave it a 410 because it really tried to be an average action film for Oliver Gruner to star in, but the overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more closure on what you just saw.","label":0},{"index":2147,"txt":"My kid makes better videos than this!

It consisted of films with strong sex, nudity and violence, more or less gratuitous and shock valued only. Love To Kill definitely belongs to the more category with some unforgettable ideas and pieces of celluloid sickness.The HK psycho Anthony Wong from the award winning The Untold Story by Herman Yau, from the same year plays a business man and a husband who likes to torture, humiliate and rape his young wife Elizabeth Lee Mei Fung who for some reason does not leave him and save herself and their little son from the disturbed tormentor. A policeman Danny Lee, the famous police character actor from films like Dr. Lamb 1992 by Billy Tang and codirected by Lee and The Killer 1989 by John Woo to name just a few however sees the problem and starts to protect the wife and the son but Anthony naturally does not like this at all, and leads it all into the typical ultramean spirited and graphic finale during a rain storm.The film is almost completely without any serious merits as it is just a piece of exploitation in order to cash in when these kind of films were so popular. The imagery and happenings are something never found in the Western cinema, at least in mainstream, and it all becomes even more mindblowing when somemost taboos for Westerners, like violence and perversions witnessed by a child, are broken in these films so often that reading the plotlines alone would make most viewers feel sick, and that goes perfectly especially for this film too.The film still has a rather interesting and creepy soundtrack in the tradition of the mentioned Dr. Lamb which practically started the whole boom in 1992. Usually the music and soundtrack in HK films is interesting and adds to the imagery, especially in these terror films. Also the cinematography is worth mentioning as the film bathes, especially in the finale, in blue colors and camera lenses as does Assassin, too, and the raging storm is captured nicely on the camera. Otherwise there is nothing that would rate the film any higher other than on the nastinessmeter.The actors and actresses are talented and professional and so do not make the film any worse with their acting. Still the film has the usual HK humor in it which makes the sick goingson even sicker as some humor is thrown into the soup. That includes some jokes about Danny Lees erection and so on..Something that could never be found in the Western serious films either. And that thing usually destroys mane otherwise noteworthy HK films as the humor is just so obvious way and attempt to entertain the audience and masses.The film has a very high outrageousness level as it has numerous scenes depicting the abuse of Wongs wife in various ways. She gets raped and molested, beaten and kicked by her husband. We also get to see some flashbacks from Wongs own childhood which turns out to be equally violent as his own father killed too and turned his young son into what he is now. These flashback scenes, mostly at the end of the film, include also some totally unexpected experiences as the imagery is speeded up for example the hits of an axe and that creates completely insane and mean spirited atmosphere to the scene. Again something that only HK exploitation makers seem to be able to come up with. The ending itself includes plenty of sudden and shocking gore as the madman wields his axe and meets also some nails, for example, on his furious way.The film is also genuinely pretty suspicious in my opinion as the violence and terror is realistically painful and deals with things that should NEVER be taken as entertainment, mostly I mean rape. The version I saw I have seen two versions includes a very long and completely nauseating rape scene that just tries to be as sadistic as possible. I am not sure does the HK audience really like imagery like this but I think no one with some sense for morality in filmsentertainment would never accept or make something like it. Women get brutalized and killed in the most sadistic and low ways so that the fates of the men seem almost tame when compared to the females.The other version I saw, the newly released DVD in HK without subtitles has this table brutality scene in a much longer form than the subtitled Taiwanese DVD which is otherwise identical to the HK version. I have also heard that the old HK Laserdisc is different from these two and since the end credits are filled with scenes and images not found in the actual film, it is impossible to say how uncut versions these that have been released or shown theatrically are. Obviously plenty of footage has been cut out, possibly even before the theatrical release.The film is written by Law Gam Fai and Lau Wing Kin, the former having written also films like Dr. Lamb, The Untold Story and Gunmen Kirk Wong, 1988 but out of his other films that I have seen, Love to Kill is the most gratuitous. Dr. Lamb and The Untold Story both are very brutal and violent but have also some attempt to some criticism towards the authorities and men in general as how it is easy to turn into a beast when chasing or fighting one. The harrowing torture imagery of The Untold Story, the victim being the criminal, is very strong and definitely has its impact to change something that may be rotten in the society and among the police for example. But there is none of this in Love to Kill, it is just honest, calculated and fastly made exploitation which is, by the way, produced by a veteran director Kirk Organized Crime  Triad Bureau 1993, Crime Story 1993 Wong!Love to Kill earns no more than 210 from me as I do not have too high appreciation on films like this.

From there on it is all downhill.Meteor Man gets a costume from his mom, fights with the resident gangs, and has many aborted encounters with the gang leaders which serves to set you up for the disappointing, overlong, and stupefying ending.It would not be so remarkably bad if it were not like watching a boxing match where the two fighters pretend to hit each other while the audience stands looking onward while the fighters just continue to dance.Despite all of this nonsense the movie has good points. It states clearly that if you try to take on a gang alone then they will come back to your home and hurt you. It states that gangs  communities need to see their real enemies the big bosses that use them for their own ends to crush honest people into a ghetto existence. It also states that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community do destroy the predators that harm them.

There are no white people among the good guys. In fact there is only one white guy in the entire movie and he is the leader of the bad guys. All the good guys are African Americans. Do not get me wrong, I do not care is the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green... What I do care about is the fact that we can barely see a white person in this movie.

If there is only one black man in a Japanese movie which is the case with The street Fighter there is no problem  in Japan most of the people are Asians.

My wife and I are avid supporters of Robert Townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie, Hollywood Shuffle. True, he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable, but his movies are still fun.Meteor Man provides a hero with an Urban Contemporary feel. I always felt that, if there were superheroes, they would not provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics. Meteor Man is realistic hero with real problems Car broken into, bad neighborhood, local drugdealing gangs using children for distribution, etc. The scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community.What I found to be truly entertaining, outside of James Earl Jones young forever performance, was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers. It was not long before they had a full agenda lined up for him, without his input, of course. It was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families lived.Yes, the plot was weak, the movie was predictable, there was bad acting and continuity was rotten, but it ranks 1 with my kids.

This film got Richard Lester recognised and paved the way for him to direct the first Beatles film A Hard Days Night.Richard Lester directed and wrote the music for his first film in 1959. This film was entitled The Running, Jumping,  Standing Still Film. It was intended to be viewed only by those who had aided in its production. Since the film was intended to be viewed by Lester and his partners alone, a small amount of money and time was invested. The sole purpose of this film is entertainment, but the main reason for its existence is the fact that it served as an experiment to work the camera. The film cost 70\u00a3 to make, and it was filmed in sepiatoned film stock in a field on a couple of Sundays. All of the shots that were filmed were included in the finished production; the finished production is eleven minutes in length.The Running, Jumping,  Standing Still Film is a comedy about English Sundays and the small hobbies that people do to pass the time. All of the events in this film take place in a field. A few of these comical events include a woman scrubbing a lawn, a man running around a tree stump with a needle to play a record, a photographer developing film in a pond, an artist aided in painting by the numbers on a models face, a man building a tent, an athlete running over the tent, and a duel between a man with a knife and a man with a gun. Not only does the film poke fun at the hobbies that people do to pass the time away, but it also pokes fun at English culture when compared to American culture. Another one of several events in this film includes a group of men and a kite, which has been constructed out of the flag of the United Kingdom. One of the men jumps inside the kite while the other men attempt to fly it, and the kite breaks. According to Neil Sinyard, author of The Films of Richard Lester, this event symbolizes the United Kingdom as lesser in power and technology when compared to the United States during the space age. According to this scene, the British fly primitive kites while the Americans, the worldpower after World War II, fly highlyadvanced rockets and space shuttles.","label":0},{"index":2162,"txt":"An interesting change from the first one. there was more mystery to this movie then the first.

Why applaud this filth?THIS silly filth is what you do if you cannot do art! Ones head  life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow viciousness as interesting. This is a camera without a brain. What really makes an artwork cool is profundity, questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history or, in this case, a knowledge of ANYTHING would be preferable!. Instead, this is just randomly piling up the ugliest images available in a world in meltdown, thanks to just the sort of empty meanness glorified as cool cause it is so far OUT, man!. These same violent events actually HAPPEN, every day. They are NOT just in the film. They refer to actual soulless people who would do those same things to YOU. Do you WANT those things done to you? A child could have thought this up, it required zero imagination, it is NOT surrealism. This lazy crap has no content, is saying nothingit is just the worst of the evening news,  it is saying nothing new, nothing we do not already know. It is the emperors new clothes, the director hoping there are enough uneducated children, proud of their streak of inhumanity, for this sloppy filth to fly.

There is no hidden meaning anywhere in this poorly made film. It is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic, BUT you cannot uncover a hidden meaning if one is not THERE! To DO that you need to view  review a REAL piece of cinema. There are PLENTY out there, directed by Fellini, Bergman, Fassbinder, Herzog, Altman, Bunuel, Kurosawa, Lynch, Tarkovsky, Peter Greenaway, Tarantino, Guillermo del Toro, Richard Linklater, Eisenstein, Aronofsky, Gus van Sant, Soderbergh, Shyamalan, Ordet.

This wannabe director, Miike, will NEVER make a film equal to one of the geniuses I just listed because he just does not have the talent! Anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like Visitor Q. Teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon! There is no message, no meaning, no plot, nothing to it at all. There are long lists of ART Films to learn frombut THIS Visitor Q is NOT an art film in any respect. It has no content to it. It is just one banal horror piled onto another, and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things HAPPEN, every single day, somewhere in the world. They are NOT okay because they are just in the film. They refer to actual soulless people who would do those same things to YOU. Do you WANT those things done to you? To others? Why? Because this world is already ugly enough, thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this. There are sooooo many art films out there to use your mind to deconstruct, but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap. There IS no deeper meaning. There is nothing to analyze; why keep trying? I have spent nearly 40 years watching practically every film ever made, and keeping up with all the new ones, but I have never seen anything as disgustingly pointless as this. It is not imaginative or even shocking, because these types of events happen daily all over the world.

I would already seen Audition, and while I did not like it much, I do rate it as one of the better modern Asian horror films. So, I went into this with sensible expectations; and unfortunately, found only boredom. I suppose this movie is actually really clever and it just went over my head, but what it seemed like to me was simply a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no coherency between them. Any comparisons to the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is blasphemous as far as I am concerned; all Miike has done here is make a film; any intelligence surrounding it has been implemented by pretentious fans, desperate to find some kind of meaning. My headache set in about 10 minutes in after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason, and it did not subside until the movie finally ended; at least twenty four hours later, or so it would seem. Do not get me wrong, I am not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around; but while this may be violent, it is also pointless and boring and I did not get one ounce of enjoyment out of it.

In Visitor Q which I think means Visitor Question he examines, in a very disturbingly gross way, the family unit. Miikes surreal vision of a dysfunctional family almost tries to be Lynchian in terms of confusion and filmmaking, but ultimately lacks the style and intrigue. We, the audience, are introduced to a bizarre array of scenarios from the opening scene with the father figure Kenichi Endo who was actually quite good paying for sex with his displaced daughter Fujiko. Then, as the father returns home, he is struck on the head by the visitor Kazushi Watanabe wielding a fairly sizeable rock, and for some reason, they both end up back at the family home. The mother Shungiku Uchida is beaten and bullied by her son Jun Muto who is also beaten and bullied by his school peers. When the visitor enters the home, he somewhat menacingly establishes himself as part of the unit. Eventually, the family begin to improve their relationship, with assistance from the visitor, through milking breasts, murder and retaining a sense of family pride.And there are other crazy scenes that somehow bring the family closer together. It is has uncomfortable humour, but is equally frustratingly silly, and overthetop in its weirdness. There is a necrophiliac scene that is utterly disgusting, but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses. Partly because of the situation itself, and partly because you cannot believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this! The style of the film is poor to say the least, and the plot is stupid and unbelievably weak. The characters themselves are all over the place, and while I understand this is not meant to be realistic, there is hardly any interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd! The camerawork is sloppy, and does not have that cinematic feel that Lynchs work entails. It is hard to take this film seriously on a surrealist level, or on an interpretation of examining the family unit in Japan. It just seems that Miike was out to shock, and the film seems selfaware that it is trying to be shocking, and it becomes almost comical to be taken seriously. All in all, I would say that this film is a bizarrely dark comedy, but it looks and feels amateurish, and seems to unnecessarily want to shock. Miikes previous film, Audition, was finely balanced between disgusting horror, character development and technique which established more intrigue in the way the film was crafted to allow the viewer to become engrossed with the plot.

The strange part of it, that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind. They rather go on foot. Maybe because the roads are unsafe, but there was no explanation for it. Anyway.

Only near the end they loose a few comrades. And that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more. Can you believe that?They fight of an army of so many, kill hundreds of them, and only loose a few of themselves. And they have rounds and round of ammo. Never run out of it. Grenades and claymore mines, an M60 machine gun and even an RPG. Where do they get this stuff. Carrying it around or what? They even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery which goes on for days. Really? Who think up this crap.I guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots, you give this movie a high rating. If not, skip this one.

Well, his own mom and stepfather of course! How pleasant. Unfortunately for Lenny, he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncles wife.Lennys next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex. However, the wife is quite pregnant and they are not currently sleeping together. Then Lenny makes a new friend. Him and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls. They have a little club where all they do is sit around and talk about sex. The problem is...it is not done in an innocent, charming 1950s sort of way.

Roys character comes off as a bit clueless in this one, along with his female costar Jane Frazee, who alternates her allegiance between Roy and Robert Livingston, portraying chief bad guy Bill Regan. The whole story seems kind of muddled, with missed opportunities for what could have been an entertaining hour or so. Like the legend of the Hangmans Hotel for example, which says the hanged man comes to life at midnight. With Andy Devine in the cast as Cookie Bullfincher, you would think the story would get a little mileage out of that set up. Instead, you have some convoluted proceedings that would have been better served if this had been a Bowery Boys flick. It was a sad attempt at a haunted hotel gimmick that relied on poor old Genevieve, who truth be told, wound up getting more screen time than Trigger, who is contract as Smartest Horse in the Movies did not have anything to say about getting upstaged by a mule. And then you have Foy Willing and his Riders of the Purple Sage replacing Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers for your musical interlude. I do not know about you, but it was already half way into the picture and I was still looking for Pat Brady  oh well! Yet there was still an interesting element to be found here if you were looking hard enough, and that turned out to be Roys athletic dismount of Trigger while still on the run from the bad guys. OK, it was probably a stunt double, but I have not seen that one before in a couple hundred Westerns.Jane Frazee does the honors as the female lead in this picture, as she would in four other films opposite Roy in the 19471948 time frame. In Under California Stars, she appeared as Andy Devines cousin, appropriately named Caroline Bullfincher. You are never quite convinced what side she will come in on in this story though, since she starts out pretending to be someone she is not, and winds up on the good guy side almost by accident.Fans of the old Laurel and Hardy films might be as surprised as I was to see James Finlayson here as the Sheriff of Sintown. I would have liked a little more comedy relief written into his role, but he played it pretty straight after all. I had to wonder, when it was all over, why he and old Vanderpool Charle Coleman wound up in the mine shaft with Cookie when there was no reason for that to be. Just a way to close it out I guess, with about as much thought as went into the rest of the picture.

Instead of what should be a gripping, tense story of a boys fight for survival in the wilderness, it comes off as a National Geographic documentary meets Columbia sportswear ad.The film begins with Brian Jared Rushton preparing for a journey by plane to see his father. His mother fortuitously gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a goingaway gift what is wrong with a Rubiks Cube?, little knowing how badly he will soon need it. Once in the air, the planes pilot a blinkandyou willmisshim cameo by Ned Beatty suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving Brian helpless as the plane crashes into a lake. Extremely lucky to walk or rather swim away virtually unscathed, Brian must find shelter, food and hope for rescue.Here is where the main problem with the movie begins. By the very nature of Brians solitude, Jared has very few lines to speak, and so the film ought to have compensated by ratcheting up the tension of each scene. Instead, he is shown walking around, sitting around, and so on, with only a minimal sense of danger. As a result, too much reliance is placed on flashbacks to the parents troubled marriage as the source of tension. These scenes merely get in the way and do not particularly add much to the story. Even worse, occasionally Jared \u0096 his face covered with mud  lets out a primal scream or two, which conjures up unfortunate parallels to Predator. Speaking of unfortunate, we could have done with being spared the sight of his mullet, but it presumably helped keep him warm at night.Another disappointment is Pamela Sue Martin in a totally ineffectual performance as the mother. Both she and the father have very little impact in the movie. For instance, we are never shown how they react to news of Brians disappearance, how they might be organizing rescue attempts, and so on.

Furthermore, despite the heralds of some reviewers of the family viewability of the film, there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing, including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded.All in all, a terrible movie that nobody should be subjected to, much less innocent kids.","label":0},{"index":2209,"txt":"Amy Poehler and Rachel Dratch are among the funnier women to have been on Saturday Night Live. It is unfortunate that they, along with Tina Fey and Maya Rudolph, were on SNL during the longest stretch of unfunny writing and sketchmaking circa 20022006 the show has ever had. Still, these two women most especially know what is funny, and they know how to write a funny movie.You will notice in the credits of this movie that Dratch and director Ryan Shiraki wrote the story for Spring Breakdown, but who wrote the actual screenplay, consisting of dialogue and all the important fillintheblank material that makes a story into a multidimensional movie? Yep, just Shiraki. Just one guy wrote the dialogue for this movie, and no women apparently wrote the script with him. The result is a pretty clich\u00e9 spring break movie that does not so much spoof the faux holiday as much as exploit it equally as much as MTV does every year.If Dratch, Poehler, and even costar Parker Posey could have contributed their handwriting to the screenplay, it would have been far less clich\u00e9. The premise is original, being about three thirtysomething women who were unpopular in high school and apparently college, too who never had the fun spring break trip they allegedly dreamed about. I say allegedly because you never quite know what fun is to these characters. They entered talent shows in the past where they sing stale prowoman anthems like True Colors, and spend their nights together holding makeyourownpizza parties. Even though none of them are especially unattractive, the outside world appears to treat them like they are. There is a scene where a blind student of Poehlers played by Poehlers real life husband Will Arnett asks her out on a date, only to touch her face and immediately change his mind. If Poehlers character is supposed to be unattractive, they obviously hired the wrong actress.The movie continues to show promise, even though we have our doubts about the main characters, when Poseys boss, Texas Senator Kay Bee Hartmann Jane Lynch, funny as always hires Posey to watch over her unpopular collegeage daughter Amber Tamblyn, playing yet another woman who is attractive in real life, but not in the eyes of any characters in this movie while she goes to a Laguna Beachlike vacation spot for Spring Break. Poehler and Dratch come along, they reluctantly get boozed up, party like they apparently should have when they were in college, and then comes the ultimate showdown with the sorority bitches lead by Sophie Monk.Sophie Monk is an incredibly attractive woman who has a body both women and men would kill to have for different reasons. Unfortunately, her movie career is off to a rough start with the abominably unfunny Date Movie 2006 and the disappointing Click 2006. Here, she plays a Southern belle, although her voice sounds like she stole Delta Burkes voice box. She hams it up a little too much, trying too hard to play a conniving bitch that she comes off as much like a caricature of spoiled college kids as the rest of the extras.Spring Breakdown was released straight to DVD despite the star power of Amy Poehler, but rightly so because the story is way too clich\u00e9. It may as well have been called National Lampoons Spring Breakdown, and the magazine probably would not have sued for trademark infringement because of the free publicity. If director Shiraki had given at least one woman the creative input, especially Rachel Dratch, this movie would have been great and not nearly as runofthemill as frathouse comedies we have seen before. I know Dratch will come up with another funny concept, and hopefully be allowed to fill in the rest of the screenplay herself. She is funny enough, and she deserves better than this halfbaked comedy that would accept Stifflers brother with open arms.","label":0},{"index":2210,"txt":"I wish I could give this movie a zero.

I will, however, say that as a film on its own, adaptation or no adaptation, it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no major explanation of its few characters.Think of A Cry in the Wild as a less luxurious, teenage mountaineer was Quincy, California the only place this was filmed? version of Cast Away. Jared Rushton is 13yearold Brian Roebson, a kid headed on a small plane to visit his father, until the craft crashes over some deserted mountain terrain, leaving the kid stranded for quite a while and having to defend himself.There are basically three parts to the film. The obvious being the ten or fifteen minute introduction of the characters, namely Brian and his mom. The next third of the movie which really consumes nearly all of the film is that of Brian roughing it. These scenes contain no particularly amazing action, nothing spectacular other than lots of beautiful cinematography of a beautiful Yukon landscape. Nothing to put you on edge, no real encounters except a brisk confrontation with a cub, and no major dilemmas to initiate some sort of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen. You might even feel briefly bored with the passage of time as we witness Brian dealing with his situation through first, primitive means, and then more improved ones using tools, etc for his survival. It is more like the ordinary time that passes if you were actually stuck in the situation, and that is pretty much about it. In other words, they put no meat on the Paulsens words when they translated them into a visual media.And, of course, the third part of the movie is his rescue.There is a subplot that continuously seeks to make itself known during this time, however. Some conflict between Brian and his parents that created a rocky, awkward relationship between them. However, for the most part, it is only explained in brief, intermittent, minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a back story for a music video. Any minute, the singer from Jefferson Starship, should chime in an start singing Sara. Other than what the viewer can draw from the implications, or guess for his own need to fill the gaps in the narrative, we get a very underdeveloped back story which was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection to the characters, whether or not it really had anything to do with Brians survival adventure in the third part of the movie. These are the flaws in the narrative that through the viewer into a stupor as he struggles to find out what the heck those people there on the screen are doing and, for me, almost done to the point of screaming at the television to say something and tell me more! It certainly was not, for me, a good adventure tale. But, for fans of Jared Rushton, it was one of the last few movies he made. So, watch it purely for nostalgia, if nothing else.","label":0},{"index":2213,"txt":"After seeing only half of the film in school back in November, today, I saw that it was on Flix channel and decided to watch it to see the rest of it and to write a new review on it.The book that the film is based on, Hatchet, is OK. This is a terrible adaption of it though.Awful and I mean awful acting, bad dialogue, and average cinematography make up this terrible adaption of Hatchet.The film starts off Brian who is the clich\u00e9 image of a late 80s teen sporting a mullet, banging his head to cheap 80s rock music and his mother driving in a car for him to get on a plane to fly up to see his estranged Dad his parents are divorced...now cue the dramatic pause. Now Brian has said goodbye to Mom and dog and is flying up to see his father. The pilot is a fat, ugly, rude man was not like that in the book who after 2 minutes in the air, has a heart attack and dies. In the book it goes into more detail with the pilot having more pains and it seemed to be that they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack.The plane within another two minutes has gone empty on fuel leaving us, the viewers, to assume that he is been up there for hours even though the sun has not changed position and the scenery looks EXACTLY the same. Nows he is crashed landed.This is the point in the movie where everything is a lot different then it was in the book. In the book it said his jacket was torn to shreds but in the movie it is perfectly fine with no tears or rips looks like he just bought it, it never said he climbed a mountain, saw a wolf, and fell asleep up there on the mountain, it never said he was attacked by a bear it said a moose but not a bear, it never said he eats the several bugs that he does, it never mentions the second tornado or that he learned to get those sparrows, skin them, and eat them or that little fish farm trap that he makes that is destroyed by one of the tornadoes nor does it mention him hurting his ribs from one of the tornadoes.I do not even think you can call what was depicted in the film a tornado. All it was was just a windstorm that knocked down several of his things.My favorite part of this camp fest was Brians lame flashbacks that are never mentioned in the book especially the clich\u00e9 scene of Brian waking up, walking over to the window and seeing his Dad with all of his things packed that can all perfectly fit into just the back of his truck leaving and screams DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD!!!! yet of course his father did not hear him even though he was just right outside and he punches his fist through the window wtf? The ending is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book I said close. In the book I think one of the key things that the rescue pilot said to Brian when he landed was you are the kid who they have been looking for! They stopped months ago... yet they left that line out in the movie.There is a pathetic epilogue with Brian somehow without counseling or therapy getting back to normal with his family. I think we were supposed to assume that they were getting together for Thanksgiving because they had a turkey on the counter. Then it shows his temporary home for what, in the movie, seemed like three days, but in the book was for several months and his hatchet, still in a tree where he left it also did not happen in the book showing where he carved a message, so perfectly done HOME where we really supposed to believe that he carved that that perfectly with just that hatchet? No quote can sum this movie up better then when Enid from Ghost World said this is so bad it is gone past good and back to bad again. Perfect description of this movie.I would not recommend it to somebody who has not read the book and are just looking to watch a movie nor would I to somebody who has read the book because they will be disappointed and bored to death.For those who have read the book, leave what your imagination created as the movie. This is awful and will bring down your thoughts on the book.110","label":0},{"index":2214,"txt":"Another big star cast, another glamours set, another reputed director, another flick filled with songs that is topping the chart buster, but alas what is missing at the day end is a story that every moviegoer expects of from such a big budget motion picture. So much hype is what that was lurking around the movie before it is red carpet premiere. A hype which went to an extent where Anil Kapoor envisages that the movie would be one of the finest love stories ever made after Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Well Anilji, which movie were you speaking of? Well the plot of the movie is about 6 different couples and 12 different people, who have a total different stance towards life, but despite their different approach towards life they all have one common problem, that is LOVE. Well indeed a luring theme. But little did we expect that the movie would be such boredom that it will let down the last expectation the audience would have from such a multistarrer movie. These are kinda movies which I totally abhor because after spending a hefty buck for a multiplex ticket I get locked in the theatre for 4 hours just waiting in agony for the climax.The trouble begins right from the start. The director gets so confused with the plot that somewhere even he gets baffled as to how to share the time slot to six different star casts. Some of the couples like Anil KapoorJuhi and Sohail KhanWhoever the female is opposite to him just does not make any sense for their existence in the movie. Salman Who calls himself rahul in a weird manner for the entire movie. Well something like Rahoooooool again as usual tries to be extra cool with his Videsi kinda Hindi accent. Hey Sallu Bhai, now that Aish is getting married, at least go get some tip from Abhishek to improve your acting abilities. A simple striptease would not make the movie a box office hit every time. And Anilji stop shaving your trade mark beard or you look totally like a eunuch. And smooching a girl of your daughters age just looks as uncool as watching Jack Nicholson in a romantic movie. And please Nikhilji avoid putting such superfluous scenes in a movie that is totally not needed for the shot.The other bigger flaw in the movie was that there was not any perfect synchronization between the stories of different couples. Every story itself looks as if it is taken from different flicks, put together to form a sadistic plot of SalaamEIshq. Bollywood still has to learn a lot from movies like Snatch, Memento where the director knows the perfect art of threading the different unrelated sequences to form a perfect blended storyline.Somewhere while I was evaluating the prerelease movie reviews someone predicted that the movie would not do good because the title of this movie adds up to the number 28, and 28 is considered a bad number in Numerology. But I totally take my stand by saying the movie will fail not coz of its Numerology defects, but because of the myriads of flaw that persisted in the movie. And when director like Nikhil Advani can make such major blunders in the entire storyline of the movie, any wonder would not have saved the movie from bombing at the Box Office.My suggestion for all you guys is, please avoid watching this movie at any cost. It is not worth a pie that you pay for the ticket. There indeed are better movies on theater screens currently which are worth watching more than SalaamEIshq.","label":0},{"index":2215,"txt":"I was so excited and hyped up about watching this film when the promos first came out in November! It looked awesome and the songs! I was quite disappointed when I went to watch it! This is a film which weaves 6 couples together. It has a multi cast of 12 people! A huge amount of stars have worked on this film. I think the director, Nikhil Advani, has not managed the situation well and should not have had many people in this movie as this would of made it easier for him. Compared to Nikhils directorial Debut Kal Ho Naa Ho , SalaameIshq falls quite behind. I think Nikhil should have a smaller star cast. I think the best factors of this film is the songs! The songs are excellent and I think that all of the songs are awesome, ShankarEhsaanLoy done an excellent job and have done an excellent jobs over the years. I think the ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs! One thing I was disappointed with, is that the director should not have included nudity in this film which is done by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. I found this extremely rude watching this with family! Although, some may find this nude as comedy, it is not something you would want to watch with parents!

Khamini priyanka chopra is a dancer. She wants to get famous and makes up a boyfriend to let news reporters be interested in her. But then Rahul Salman Khan appears and he claims to be her boyfriend.Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actress. When she yells, I get annoyed. Salman khan cannot play comic roles. But in his serious parts he is marvelous.2. Vinay Anil Kapoor is married to Seema Juhi Chawla. He gets in a midlife crisis and gets attracted to a much younger woman, with forgetting what he really has in life; his wife and kids.Anil kapoor en Juhi are natural born actors  actresses. They are great. But this story is to thin for them.3. Shiven Akshaye Khanna is going to get married to Gia Ayesha Takia, but he gets cold feet and blows the wedding off.4. Ashutosh Joh Abraham is married to Tehzeeb Vidya Balan. She gets an accident and suffers a memory loss. Now she does not know that she loves her husband anymore.5. Raju Govinda is a cab driver. He meets Stephani Shannon Esrechowitz who is a white woman who is in love with an Indian male but he is about to get married with an Indian woman. Raju has to bring Staphani to that man, but falls in love with her.I never liked Govindas movies. He is very annoying, not funny. But in this movie I liked him very much, like he has been growing up the last years.6. Oh yes! There is Sohail Khan! He plays Ram Dayal who is just married to Phoolwati Isha Koppikar. He want to get some serious action with her, but every time her family comes in between.Sohail Khan is not a handsome actor, but he is funny! I like his movies.Now heres the problem. All these stories are not interesting. To make one story from six not interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting! Here and there the stories touch each other, but is not significant for the characters.My conclusion; Priyanka cannot act! Loose that woman in the bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should make more movies, this role for him was too small. Salman Khan cannot act comic roles, but real serious movies. That is written on his life as an actor.

In the meantime, the budding couples respective children nepotism alert Bogdanovichs daughters spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on love while observing their parents. Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly. Everybody looks great, but so what? It is a movie and we can expect that much, if that is what you are looking for you would be better off picking up a copy of Vogue.Oh and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin who wrote the song from which the movies title is derived had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20s may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. They All Laughed tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody least of all Peter Bogdanovich  has the good sense to put on the brakes.Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it did not prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there is no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Strattens scenes.

The screenplay is dull, probably he was drunk when he was writing this film. There is no strong hold on any of these stories. Nothing new , nothing to hold the audience and filled with dialogs which you would have heard a million times before.

Why cannot she marry him and still take the film ?? or does Advani and Priyanaka just want to prove the world that it is in fact true that female actors cant be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films once they are married?? With six actors in the film obviously Advani cant produce the film all by himself. So he makes full use of sponsors like the Times group, shamelessly promoting their Filmfare magazines.

A oneline concept that looks good on paper which also worked in an earlier English film  Love Actually goes terribly wrong thanks to inept and shallow writing. A wellintentioned idea gets crushed to smithereens under the weight of its own gargantuan ambition. A director so completely besotted by his own much applauded first film goes overboard with the devices that worked in his earlier film Kal Ho Na Ho  try counting the number of times the device of split screens is used in this flick. The problem is  what worked fabulously in Kal Ho Na Ho were the emotional excesses of the Karan Johar school of filmmaking, but here, emotion does not quite grace us with its appearance on the screen  no, not even cursorily. The writer director gives us six relationships with one common problem  love, but where is the intensity, where is the depth, where is the emotion? A tribute to love sans emotion? And one that goes on and on and on...... Nah, it just cannot work! In my opinion, the basic requirement for a portmanteau film like this to work is that not only should each individual story be complete, it should  in some way or the other  follow the graph of the traditional threeact structure screen writing guru, Syd Fields Paradigm. That is the real reason why SalaameIshq did not work for me. None of the stories had any depth or a rollercoaster ride of emotional ups and downs one expects in mainstream Hindi cinema. Also, the linkage between some of the stories seemed tenuous and very forced. It is not clear what Salman Khan is doing at Ayesha Takias wedding. If he was required to be present at the wedding scene for a neat wrapup, why not conjure a few more coincidences and bring the other two couples also to the wedding? That would be neater.But yes, some of the stories did have a lot of promise. For one, the Anil KapoorJuhee Chawla story tries to address a very real situation  midlife crisis, but its journey is so linear that you are left wondering if it was really an issue. Similarly, the problem of commitment in the Akshaye KhannaAyesha Takia story is also true to life. If only it was developed a little better. I felt that the more promising stories in this mishmash were told from the male point of view, which is fine, but it brings down the emotional quotient of these stories because the female characters  Juhee Chawla and Ayesh Takia in particular  have all the depth of a halffilled bath tub. Was not this film supposed to be about 12 different lives? Now the actors. John Abraham still needs to learn acting, while Vidya Balan is dependable and endearing as ever. Anil Kapoor gets a role written just for him but sometimes overplay the boredom of his character. Since she did not get a meaty character to portray, Juhee Chawla uses her charming smile and natural acting style to cover up for it. Akshaye Khanna is fine despite going a trifle overthetop in a few scenes. Ayesha Takia has nothing much to do, but she does remind us that she is the same girl who surprised us with her bravura performance in Dor. Govinda tries to make up for that HUGE mistake called Bhagam Bhag, and succeeds to a large extent.That brings me the most irritating track of the film which unpardonably ends up hogging the maximum screen time  Salman Khan and Priyanka Chopra. The track is irritating mainly because of them. But I must credit them for their consistency. They are consistently BAD all through the film. Priyanka could well be the next queen of hamming  I do not buy the crap that her role that of an item girl required her to act overthetop. Somebody should tell her the difference between being flamboyant because the character demands it and downright hamming. If you have seen Rakhi Sawant who seems to be the inspiration behind this role in her interviews and Bigg Boss you will know what I mean. I strongly feel that if Nikhil Advani had taken Rakhi Sawant in this role rather than a bigger star like Priyanka, the story would have worked better. Salman Khans phony accent is.....well, Shannon Esras Hindi is less accented than Salmans.To be fair to the director, he does manage to add some good directorial touches to the film. I particularly liked the use of grey as the predominant color in the Anil KapoorJuhee Chawla story as a metaphor for their boring existence, and the bright colors that come into the story with the arrival of the other woman. But will anyone choose to paint their house in varying, depressing shades of grey? That is acceptable cinematic license I would say. But when the film runs almost for 4 hours, it almost feels like the director is trying too hard to give the audience a glimpse of his touch in an endlessly meandering montage of uninspiring sequences.Maybe Nikhil Advani wants us to sit in the theatre for as long as is humanly possible pata nahin, kal ho na ho.","label":0},{"index":2232,"txt":"I had a video of the thing.

The Hades Factor being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to start.From the outset the film was disappointing. Simple elements from the film such as Griffins first meeting with Smith are needlessly different from the book, and much less exhilarating. Several characters are poorly cast, too. For starters Dorff is woeful as Smith. Not a bad actor, just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft, and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of John Smith.Renaming, reassignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film. For example the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire backstory of the virus, including the involvement of VAXHAM makes the entire point to the film somewhat hazy. Marty Zellerbach is a very large part of the book, and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book is another big mistake.Rachel Russel is presumably supposed to be Randi Russel from the book. Not only is she supposed to be the sister of Sophie Amsden should be called Sophia Russel but she is also supposed to work from the CIA, NOT Covertone.

The whole idea that this Izodwearing, dune buggydriving punk could hold off one of the most powerful mobs in Rome is just plain silly. His friend may be good with a gun, but he is up against a group of trained killers. The old mobster is little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to the face off with the mob. There is also a subplot about how the friends father was killed years ago by the mob boss, but there is little made of it and it does not help the movie any at all. The mob boss, Mister Scarface, is played by Jack Palance. I suppose he got the name because he has what looks like a shaving nick on his cheek.

The whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli Vittorio Caprioli, but as most other viewers commented, he is about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I found it somewhat unbelievable that Manzaris goons who chased Tony through the streets did not actually stroke out before Tony even laid a hand on them. For all of his buildup as the title character, Jack Palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale, making the U.S. working title, Mr. Scarface, rather moot.

Now, that I got your attention with that horribly inaccurate statement that should be a hanging offense if spoken, let me begin my short overview of this tacky, offensive, pretentious and boring hunk of junk I guess you could consider a movie. First of all, the low budget of this stinker is totally obvious based on the very poor and inexperienced direction of Christian Vuissa, and the tacky, overly preachy, whiny and stilted screenplay by F. Mathew Smith. I really despise the fact that it sends a very proMormon, and sort of antievery other religion message. Yes, the story is about a small town half full with Mormons and half full with Baptists. It shows all the main and rolemodel characters being Mormon, and being so nice and perfect, yet they are being picked on by the evil, conniving and very judgmental Baptists. It shows how beautiful Mormons are and how coldhearted and ignorant Baptists are, instead of showing a little solidarity like would be appropriate and realistic. I am a part of neither religion I am actually an atheist, but this offended me, along with another countless amount of Baptists most likely. It shows the Baptists as being very unopened and unwelcoming to the Mormons, and the Mormons being very accepting, when again, in reality there is a mutual likedislike between them. Sorry, I did not mean to go off on a rant.Another aspect of Baptists at Our Barbecue I did not much care for, was the acting. The performances are very amateurish and unnatural, especially from the female lead Heather Beers. Miss Beers stumbles her way through her part without any passion or feeling for her role, and I was not too much impressed with Dan Merkley, who is the main character in this lackluster of a motion picture, but I have to say he is way more talented or shows more talent in this film then Heather Beers. Whoever played the town sheriff was awful also. Although there is maybe a tiny laugh deep within the film, it is full of clich\u00e9s. For example, the main character, Tartan Merkley, finds solace with a Native American who always gives him the best advice on things relating to a tribal way of life  how clich\u00e9 is that? To make the situation even more of a pathetic clich\u00e9, Tartan buys the poor, lonely heathen a puppy dog. Ugghhh! If you want my advice, stay as far away from Baptists at Our Barbecue as you can.

This is the kind of nonsense that Mazursky thinks about when writing scripts for his movies. Fortunately, some of Sutherlands hippie friends make fun of this blackrevolution premise, and the resulting dialogue is not bad; a little later, the Jewish guy makes a crack about Sutherland making a movie about masturbation and the black problem, when the latter starts talking about masturbation. Another funny moment is when Sutherlands older daughter performs some PC crap on stage with her white schoolmates, and they all say We, the black people of the Republic of South Africa....There is always a certain amount of selfindulgence when Hollywood makes a movie about Hollywood  especially when it is Hollywood making a movie about Hollywood discussing Hollywood doing movies. Now, that is very, very selfindulgent, indeed. The scene with Fellini playing himself is more amusing than annoying, though. Mazursky throws in the standard flowerchildren and antiVietnam bullshit into the soup, and also pokes fun at corporate Hollywood, but he wasis just as much a part of the phony Hollywood lyrics from that song in the surreal war segment as anyone else; I am pretty sure that he, too, makes phony smalltalk in Beverly Hills parties and grins fakely while shaking the hands of people whom he either does not know or like, but whose money he wants badly for his next leftwing project. As for his hair he has the worst hair I have seen in a very long time on film or elsewhere; it is sort of like the kind of long hair that a middleaged accountant would have if he grew it long. The film remains relatively interesting in spite of its aimlessness, but it bogs down somewhat into tedium in the last third.

The plot of Devil Dog is easy to describe to fans of the horror genre simply think of The Omen and replace the newborn baby boy with a nest of German Shepard pups! Seriously, I am not kidding, that is what the movie is about! During the opening sequence, members of some kind of satanic cult buy a female dog in heat only to have it impregnated by Satan himself. You would think that the Lord of Darkness has other things on His mind than to fornicate with a German Shepard and take over the world one evil puppy at the time, but apparently not. Exactly like little Damien in The Omen, one of the puppies is taken in by model family and grows up to become a beautiful and charismatic animal. But Lucky \u0096 that is the dogs name \u0096 is pure evil and liquidates annoying neighbors and nosy school teachers in derivative and tamely executed ways. He also inflicts his malignant character on the family wife and children, but he cannot force the father Richard Crenna to stick his arm into a lawnmower because he is a chosen one. The whole thing becomes too moronic for words when Crenna eventually travels to Ecuador to search for an ancient wall painting and gets advice from an old witchdoctor who speaks perfect English. I guess he learned that living in isolation atop of a mountain his entire life.

The special effects are pathetic, especially near the end when the Satandog mutates into an utterly cheesy shadow on the wall. Devil Dog is a truly dumb movie, but it is definitely hilarious to watch late at night with some friends and loads of liquor. There are entertaining brief cameos of Martine Beswick Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde as the terrifying cult queen and R.G. Armstrong The Car, The Pack as the evil fruit, vegetable and puppy salesman.

She looked gorgeous in all of her brief cameo scenes which, though numerous, were probably all filmed on the same day, one after the other, with the director saying, Alright, now look beautiful . . . good ... OK, now look frightened ... good... now look depressed ... good ... now look interested . . . good ... now look beautiful again ... good...Most Greek and Trojan men had British accents. Those with American accents could not act.Trojans looked just like Greeks, but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen.Brad Pitt does not blink on camera.Helen of Troys biggest line was, They are coming for me.Trojan music sounded remarkably like modern Bulgarian music.Brad Pitts thighs go all the way up.Achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close, but it is OK. They were cousins. Never mind what history says.Peter OToole can tell an entire story with just an expression.Trojan gods apparently all had Greek names, but their statues either looked Egyptian or like Peter OToole in drag.Greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting, much like American men.All of the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color... Light Egyptian, by Max Factor.Troy had only three women.There were lots of blond Greeks, which is good news for Brad Pitt, who would otherwise have really stuck out.Despite their coastal desert locale, Greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amounts of timber to build fires, funeral pyres, Trojan horses and the like.British actors look silly with Greek hairdos.Brad Pitt changes expression only when the sun is shining directly in his eyes.Greek soldiers fought constantly, but their outfits always looked impeccable.Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts.Apparently Greek temples were always in ruins, even back when they were all new.","label":0},{"index":2272,"txt":"Hello there,This is my first post in IMDb even though I use it as a reference for quite a while.

The fact that I am a Greek is inevitably going to affect my judgement I hope not to your annoyance.I spent 2 years of my life, all we Greeks did actually, analysing Omirus epos and not Homers as you see everywhere, rhyme by rhyme. If I recall well it was Iliada Iliad on 8th grade and Odysseia Odyssey on 9th grade. Warners Troy, was a big disappointment to me and my fellow Greeks around the campus I study in the UK.Iliad epos is one of the very best literature works ever made. It was composed by a Greek poet Omirus a whole 400 years after the actual war. Historians put Trojan war around 1200 BC, and the actual reason of the war not being Helens beauty but the strategically crucial position of Troy. That said one may now understand that Omirus epos is not presenting the actual events as it is not accurate historically but this was never the purpose of this work. Reading this huge poem, one can find himself wondering for the very definitions of honour, love, anger, hate, heroism, discipline, loyalty and so on. The best part and the most educational as well were these prolonged talks between the warriors before the battle. None of these though were revealed in TroyWarners Troy was really cheap to my eyes, and to other intellectual people English Finnish and German colleagues of me as well. It is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster computers graphics did the whole work, and yet it is Wolfgang Petersens best work.

Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris OUTSIDE the walls of Troy with an arrow to the ankle! It annoys me that such a classic story as this is turned into a soap.And do not even start me on the lack of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman the war was fought over and it did not even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other.

They completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera. The elements that WERE faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles. It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles who has a strange combination of nearly Matrixlike powers, utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem turn to Fabio on the beach in the guise of Pitt who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced. The actors were actually decent, trying to make the best of a ridiculous script. It was actually a waste of so much talent Peter OToole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic.

By the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic, it is too late to care. Mark, on the other hand, follows in Demi Moores footsteps from Ghost, by crying profusely throughout the movie. There is a bizarre switch in tone after Mark returns. Suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor, a la the TV show Bewitched. But that does not last long. Once Simons emotional health is at stake, the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish, with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings.

Unfortunately Kinjite Forbidden Subjects falls in the latter. That is sad because Kinjite could have been a whole lot better. But for the life of me I do not understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing Japanese girl, a guy used to getting some cheap jollies because the romance in his marriage has run out. That might have been good for another film altogether, but it served no purpose here.A straightforward cop drama with Charles Bronson as a vice cop who is seen a bit too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against orientals. That part could also have used a little explaining as well. But he is going to have to overcome it if he and patient partner Perry Lopez are going to locate a captured Japanese school girl.Bronsons time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. A stylish, murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and he and Bronson have some history. In fact in the films best scene, Bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and set his car on fire.At one point Fernandez happens to spot Bronson and Lopez in an all night delicatessen and this being after his rolex snack, he sprays the place with an Uzi killing everyone, but Bronson and Lopez. I really think that little incident would have had more than a couple vice cops from the LAPD after Fernandez. But that is another terribly big hole in the plot.Still there is a very rough justice in the end for Fernandez. I wish the whole film had been better though. This was the last film of the BronsonThompson team and J. Lee Thompsons last as a director. He should have gone out with something better.","label":0},{"index":2292,"txt":"The husbandandwife team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were huge stars in vaudeville, yet they made very few films. As is the case for some other performers of their era George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence the most accessible piece of film footage for Fields and Seeley is the biopic ABOUT them, in which they are portrayed by other actors Somebody Loves Me, starring Betty Hutton and that inimitable songanddance man Ralph Meeker.In their heyday, Fields and Seeley were so hugely popular that another husbandandwife vaudeville act  Jesse Block and Eve Sully  achieved nearly as much stardom performing an almost identical act, effectively becoming the secondteam Fields and Seeley. Offstage, though, there was a major difference in the couples living arrangements. Fields and Seeley lived in hotel suites, paying roomservice rates for every meal they ate, and eventually running out of money. Block and Sully lived modestly and invested their earnings wisely, ending in comfortable retirement.The first 30 seconds of this Vitaphone short are occupied by two spatswearing pianists. Apparently these two men had some slight name value of their own in 1930, although I have never heard of them. Finally, Fields and Seely rush in and start performing. They both have plenty of pep, and she is fairly attractive.I was annoyed that both performers keep making movements as if they are about to break into a dance, but they never quite do so until the third of the three songs they perform in this short. When they finally start hoofing, the results are not impressive.I was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major performers doing their vaude act. Now that I have seen it, I understand why they never became stars in movie musicals. My rating for this one just 4 out of 10, and I will stick with Block and Sully.","label":0},{"index":2293,"txt":"This is one of the most boring horror films I have ever seen, as it is absolutely god awful, John Carradine has very limited screen time.

For starters this films alternate  much more common title is Legacy of Blood which is also the title of an obscure horror film directed by Andy Milliagn back in 78 which I have always wanted to see, both films are regularly mixed up as both have similar stories  when I checked my on screen cable TV guide for Legacy of Blood I was excited because it said it was the Milligan film  even listed him as director so when I actually sat down to watch it  I heard John Carradines voice  I then knew it was not the Milligan film that I had wanted to see, my heart sank. Then, of course, there is the simple yet undeniably straight forward fact that Blood Legacy is a total utter piece of crap that is literally painful to watch at times. The script by Monson  Eric Norden is slow, boring  extremely predictable. The characters are absolutely bizarre in an annoying way, the freak of a servant who asks his sister ? to cane him, the strange set of Brothers  Sisters who are just downright unlikeable  so far removed from reality that any tension or mystery that the simplistic whodunit story could have achieved is sorely missing  then there is the awful twist ending that you can guess within the first 10 minutes. It is boring to watch, it is poorly paced  it is just a chore to even think about it. Please, someone save me as this is really bad stuff. I could go on all day about how bad Blood Legacy is, I really could.Director Monson was either working with a none existent budget or judging by this he should not have even been directing traffic. The entire film looks ugly, it is poorly photographed  there is no atmosphere or scares. The blood  gore is tame, there is an axe in a head, a decapitated head, a scene when someone is stung to death by wasps  the best murder when someones face is eaten by piranha. However there are question marks over this scene, so there is the victim, right. There is the tank of piranha, right. Victims head is placed in piranha tank, right. Pirahna eat victims face, right. Water remains crystal clear despite said victim having his face eaten, erm where is the blood?Technically Blood Legacy is terrible, it looks awful, the sound was obviously shot live  it is muffled  hard to hear which considering the terrible dialogue is maybe a blessing in disguise.

But if there is a slower, more plodding, more lethargic and worsestaged version out there somewhere, it must have been acted at grade schoollevel. Having seen it on MST3K helps, with Mike and the robots taking jolly good jabs at the old boy, puncturing the profundity of black and white TV, Shakespeare and the wisdom ? of Germans acting out an English play and making it look like an Ingmar Bergman reject.Of course, the best parts are the MST riffs.

No doubt he is a great actor, but here he comes off about as well as Paul Newman in The Silver Chalice. Ever see that one?

I am a big Francophile and art film lover, but I believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something arty or intellectual into something it is not. I will be blunt it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that I never, ever wanted to actually see. Obviously, the piano teacher has some major psychological issues, but I really did not want to see them displayed so graphically. The film is, in essence, disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem for a Dream, I was repulsed by the last sort of scene with Jennifer Connelly, but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion I felt during this film.","label":0},{"index":2320,"txt":"I rented the video of The Piano Teacher knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box. I did this with some trepidation because films that win awards at Cannes are usually very good or very bad. Unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category. About one quarter of the way into it I found myself saying out loud, This movie is boring. About half way through I was saying to myself, Where have I seen this before? At the three quarters mark I had figured it out.In spite of its literary origins, this film is essentially a remake of Robert Altmans much earlier 1969, and better, That Cold Day in the Park. Although the details obviously differ and Altmans work was more plotdriven and less of a character study, the two films are thematically identical. There is nothing new to be seen in this production. Every aspect of it has been done before a character spiralling out of control with increasingly selfdestructive behavior Abel Ferraras Bad Lieutenant 1992; a perverse and doomed love culminating in an operatic near death scene David Cronenbergs M. Butterfly 1993; uncommonly brutal sex scenes David Lynchs Blue Velvet 1986; and so on. Hence, I am bemused by the fact that so many found the film to be shocking, shattering, etc. This highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable, and clearly succeeded with some. However, I largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of filmviewing experience. See enough movies and you really will, eventually, have seen it all. And while it is true that I saw the expurgated Rrated version, I doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of The Piano Teacher.Technically, the film is not without merit. There is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent. Isabelle Hupperts creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time. This is the first of Hanekes films that I have seen, and if I were to see more I expect I would have the same opinion of him that I have of Ferrara an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be.

Perhaps the French had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film. I understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether.This is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it is over. I LOVED movies such as Trainspotting or Requiem for a Dream  which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing.

The only reason I did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot. The plot, however, has little to recommend.

Her novel spawned a film that won second prize at Cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads. Am I a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that anything goes?Gobble, gobble is the favoured orthographic representation in Britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey. In the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception. Gobble, gobble and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners.The embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film cannot be overstated. It begins very badly, as if made to annoy the viewer. Credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes. We are introduced to Professor Erika Kohut, apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress, a stony professor of piano. She lives with her husky and domineering mum. Dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action.Reviewing The Piano Teacher is difficult, beyond registering its unpleasantness. What we see in the film and might read in the book, for all I know is a tawdry, exploitative, nonsensical tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on.Erika, whose name is minimally used, is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed. Not quite, because there is a handbags at two paces scene with her gravellyvoiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies. If a reviewer has to yawn extract a leitmotif why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do, Elrikas violently alternating moods would be it.A young hunk, Walter, studying to become a low voltage engineer, whatever that is, and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments, is also a talented pianist. He encounters Elrika at an oldfashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris. In the glib fashion of so much art, he immediately falls in love and starts to cherchez la femme.Repressed Erika has a liking for hardcore pornography, shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches.Walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by Erika, whose teaching style is characterised by remoteness, hostility, discouragement and humiliation.He soon declares his love and before long pursues Erika into the Ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex. Erika retains control over her lovesick swain. She promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges.In the meantime, chillingly jealous because of Walters kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert, Erika fills the students coat pocket with broken glass, causing severe lacerations to those delicate pianoplaying hands.The next big scene bypassing the genital selfmutilation, etc has Walter turning up at the apartment Erika shares with her mother. Erika want to be humiliated, bound, slapped, etc. Sensible Walter is, for the moment, repulsed and marches off into the night.At this point there is still nearly an hour to go. The viewer can only fear the worst. Erika tracks down Walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice. They retire to a back room. Lusty Wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers. His baby gravy is soon expelled with other stomach contents. Ho hum.Repulsed but hooked, perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor, Walter returns to Erikas apartment. Can you guess what happens now? It is not very deep or difficult. Yes, he becomes a brute while Erika becomes a victim. One moment he is locking maman in her room and slapping Erika, the next he is kicking her in the face, having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love. Am I being unfair in this summary? Watch the film if you want, but I would advise you not to.Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they are in the right mood. I could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if I wanted. But I prefer not to, because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing.I am supposed to say that parentally repressed Erika longs for love, ineffectively seeks it in pornography, inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears, pink and throbbing, under her nose, belatedly realises that she does not like being hurt, blah, blah, blah.The world has, for reasons not explained, stunted her. She apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving  but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist, because that is his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise.At the end, if you have the patience to be there, there is a small twist. Before going to the final scene, where she is due to perform as a substitute for the underwearsoiling student with the lacerated hands, Erika packs a knife in her handbag. For Walter?Yes, you are ahead of me. She stabs herself in a none lifethreatening area and leaves.

Before I go further, it seems only fair that I point out the following so a reader can see if I am prejudiced or not. I am trying to be objective, for the record.I tend to enjoy Mahers HBO show now and then, though I rarely think he is the source of the humor. I do not really care for his standup either. But he makes some good points on the show now and again, and I liked Politically Incorrect, though he was still fairly politically correct which I deem a negative because the very term sounds Orwellian or at least fascist. As for my religious views, I will say for simplicitys sake that I am a nondenom. Christian with some views that are objectivist and some that are agnostic mixed in.That being said, this a bad documentary for reasons that have not been touched on yet by many reviewersthough the ones mentioned are valid too. The reason it is not convincing is not just that he argues the main point without letting others talk and his point boils down to nothing logical either, it is just come on, really? which is not a point, just a question. Try David Hume if you want a decent argument.. The reason this is not convincing lies in his lack of experts on the subject matter. I saw this about 2 months ago and I only recall him talking to one person whose credentials as a professional were mentioned if he was not a clergyman. There are probably hundreds of scientists or at least professors with Masters or Doctorates willing to do a bit of verbal sparring, particularly in the fields of History, Anthropology or a host of others.If one compares this to Ben Steins Expelled No Intelligence Allowed he will find that Stein interviews about 30 credentialed professors, professionals, clergy, etc. He does this with a variety of sources with various backgrounds. He also makes a point in his film regarding freedom of thought and education. Maher could easily have pointed out wrongs committed by theocratic rules throughout centuries or persecutions from this. Instead he idiotically refers to the 20th centurys secular totalitarian regimes as evidence of why secularism needs more sociopolitical power!!!! it is in the bonus features where he is standing in front of the Anne Frank house I think. This is a true Orwellian headtrip. He blames Christianity in particular on many pointless deathswhich has had its share, though far smaller than most!!without even including a basic view of the evidence. Perhaps this is because that argument is dwarfed by secular humanisms miserable record of the 20th Century ALONE.Another glaring weakness is his unwillingness to talk to anyone that would be considered a moderate or average practitioner. He picks out the weakest gazelles of the herd. How difficult is that? How does proving the existence of exceptions move toward disproving the general rule? It does not. Wow, so people in cults think outside of the norm? How enlightening to know this. Great work Maher! Again, it would be fairly easy to interview someone like Laurence Vance and include his work on refuting the idea of patriotic duty that demands a person fight in any war his country is involved in.Beyond all that, he is just not that funny here. Some of the clips that are overlaid in clever out of contextirreverent ways might garner a laugh, but mostly work to illustrate how a real contextual argument from Maher will NOT be forthcoming, much less convincing. He spends most of his time bashing Christians, spouting inaccuracies, and interviewing fringe groups that he does not allow to really answer his questions.For the record, there are good questions to honestly ask of religious folks and many they should ask of themselves. He touches on almost none of these. I get the feeling that I could have responded much better to most of his questioning than the people he interviewed, but the whole thing reeks of deckstacking in terms of what is included and what was edited out.","label":0},{"index":2331,"txt":"I have been a fan of all things Bill Maher for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting. Of course, I am Catholic, come from a welleducated family and go to church of my own volition, which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of Bills opinions.Bills problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative. He is correct to document the sociological aspects of it i.e. one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion or, more accurately, by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of God, but that said he never looks at its positive side. Quite frankly, I think that hell would freeze over before Bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of Calcutta where Mother Theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor. She is dead now of course, but he could easily visit the Jesuit priest in East LA who runs Homeboy Industries, which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills, get their tattoos removed, and to become responsible members of society, or he could visit USCs Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies, which has brought together some of the worlds finest theologians, diplomats, and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the worlds poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the worlds people who live on less than 1 a day. Of course he will not do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion, and it is so much easier to continue to make snide, superficial jokes.That fits into the other large problem with Bills movie, which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is. In this movie, you have Maher the Cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational Christian truck stop service, in a night club with a Dutch guy who smokes pot all the time, with the minister of a storefront church in Miami who claims to be the reincarnation of Christ, and with an actor playing Jesus at a Holy Land theme park.What you will not see in Bills film, beyond some superficial speculation alongside a Ph.D in Grand Central Station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses, is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like Notre Dame, BYU, or Wheaton College, who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter. You will not see any serious discussion of any of the writings of C.S. Lewis, G.K. Chesterton, or any papal encyclicals, and of course you also will not find any discussion whatsoever of any of the nonAbrahamic Judaism, Christianity, and Islam faiths whatsoever. All you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending, snobby elitist from the west side of LA who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gutlevel understanding whatsoever of how the other half of America that elected George W. Bush twice lives their lives or about the school of thought behind it.I get a lot of what Bills saying, but for someone possessing his intellect and influence, this film was nothing less than pathetic.

I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent.

Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He is small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky.Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching AE Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS American Masters Finding Lucy.

That is a good point in and of itself. Maher dismisses our religious past as a neurological disorder conveniently ignoring how his entire society, art and science is rooted in it.In this film, he relies heavily on his keenlyhoned skill set of irony and cynicism to make his point while attempting to appear erudite and wise. Unfortunately, his intellect is not up to the task.Maher makes us laugh but is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box. As an example, he responds to an interviewees and I use the term loosely as they were clearly all ambushees assertion that the existence of Jesus is historical fact with a deadpan No, it is not followed by a long stare meant to convey contempt at the subjects naivety a device nauseatingly overused in this film.

The only people given a fair chance to speak their mind are those who say what Bill Maher wants them to say.

But like many comedians, the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying. I think that the major problem in this film is his lack of sensibility. This might be just a personal taste, but comedy that constantly demeans somebody cannot be taken as truth. Bill is obviously emotionally reactive to religious fundamentalism. I agree with Bill that religious fanaticism is not sensible, but the response to it cannot be sensible. It will create unnecessary turmoil. We can do better than just react to fundamentalism. His conclusion is that we do not know and he fervently tries to convince the spectator that nobody knows anything, to the point that the agnostic community has been concerned with his lack of serious research in comparative religion. His humility that he only knows that he does not, is a contradiction as he tries to insist that all religious thought is nonsense.I had great trouble seeing bits of Zeitgeist, the movie in Bills film. All the astrotheologyinfluenced nonsense that simplifies all religions as the same is simply disappointing. Zeitgeist has provoked a lot of controversy and has messed up the validity of so much of the valuable Religion Studies scholarship.

Agnosticism is far more complex and philosophically academic than defending every single issue as we do not know.This film is an obvious proof of how postmodernism has been able to oversimplify and generalize major issues in human history.Watch the film it has hilarious interviews and bits but PLEASE do not behave like Bill. You cannot expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making sardonic comments in every other line. His arguing techniques are demeaning and insulting, provoking emotional reactions rather than rational and logical argumentation.. There needs to be a more mature way of dealing with these issues.","label":0},{"index":2338,"txt":"Bill Mahers Religulous is not an attack on organized religion. It is an attack on Christianity and Islam. Apart from ridiculing a bunch of Rabbis inventing warped machines to get around Sabbath regulations, he really does not attack Judaism and seems enraged when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called holy books of organized religion. This is evidence of his complete and utter lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film.I find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even all that intelligent. Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but what do you have to offer them in return? Nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they are stupid. What makes him the rational person in the room? In a way it reflects how he really is not and in the process ends up looking just as stupid as those people.If you want to watch a good moviedocumentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization, watch Richard Dawkins Root of All Evil?. It is a brilliantly researched documentary, clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how.Bill Mahers Religulous is not funny, poses no interesting questions nor does it provide any insight on so controversial a topic.

If you asked me to name a good gangster movie, I would have dozens to choose from. If you asked me to name a bad gangster movie, probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since I saw the film for the first and I promise you, the last time. That film is The General, unrelated to the 1926 silent film of the same name. This is a very dry, very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story it is more than easy to follow but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor.Like Goodfellas 1990 and American Gangster 2007\u0097two superior mob movies\u0097The General is based on real people and true events. The film revolves around an Irish criminal named Martin Cahill Brendan Gleeson who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult. Meanwhile, the police led by an inspector named Kenny Jon Voight try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict or kill him.Perhaps because it is a film in the same category as the marvelous Goodfellas 1990 and the first two Godfather films, I was expecting too much from The General. But that may be going too easy on it. This would have been a bad film had I not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its fartoostretched running time of screaming bad scenes. Let us start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented. For some reason, director John Boorman and cinematographer Seamus Deasy selected to film this movie in blackandwhite while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a fullfledged color film. Now I have nothing against bw pictures, not even ones made in modernday times. Schindlers List 1993 was more than ninety percent filmed in blackandwhite and it is a masterpiece. The General, made just five years after Schindlers List is not. The cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very videogamelike quality that I found simply annoying. The filmmakers were obviously going for a realists documentarylike style, like Schindlers List did, but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time, too much like a classicstyle motion picture. Performances in the film range from passable to poor. Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles, but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting. The sound design is also very primitive, probably in an attempt to give it a 40s crimenoir appeal, but that also fails because again, it is made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place.But the worst thing that occurs is that there is not one\u0097not one\u0097character in the film that I felt any emotions or opinions for. In fact, for every moment of every scene, the only thought going through my head was okay\u0085so what? Moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and timeconsuming here. I did not sympathize or hate the Brendan Gleeson character because the way the Cahill character is written is simply flat and dull. Gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real Martin Cahill obviously did. If a character is killed off as they always are in gangster films, we feel nothing. No remorse, no relief, no surprise, nothing. We just say so what? And that is all I did during the entire running time of this very flimsy, very poorlymade crime film.","label":0},{"index":2342,"txt":"Just had to write that one liner, but it really is.

One of three films made that year about famed Northern Irish criminal Martin Cahill alongside Ordinary Decent Criminal and Vicious Circles, it has an abundance of incident and style the film was shot in colour but released in bw Scope in some territories but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever. With a main character who threatens witnesses, car bombs doctors, causes a hundred people to lose their jobs, tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only approve but actually suggest a m\u00e9nage a trios with her sister, it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film. It does not get it. Instead, it is lumbered with what may well be Brendan Gleesons worst and most disinterested performance he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but there is nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character. On the plus side, this helps not to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug, but it is at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his antics.There is a minor section that picks up interest when the IRA whips up a local hate campaign against the General and his men, painting them as antisocial drug dealers purely because Cahill will not share his loot from a robbery with them, but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot  something to do with Cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protesters which we are expected to find lovably cheeky  that it is just thrown away. Things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart, but by then it is too late to really care. Adrian Dunbar, Maria Doyle Kennedy and the gorgeous Angeline Ball do good work in adoring supporting roles, but Jon Voights hammy Garda beat cop seems to be there more for American sales than moral balance, overcompensating for Gleesons comatose noninvolvement in what feels like a total misfire.

It is top of the line from First National in these departments. The story is mildly engaging and similar to the plots of Millers other two films SUNNY, SALLY where working girl is romanced by rich boy with family disapproval, complications and final clinch. All the four musical numbers are bunched at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without any further musical buoyancy. Miller sings parts of I THINK OF BABY and reprises BECAUSE OF YOU. There are also Do not EVER BE BLUE and THOUGH You are NOT THE FIRST ONE.Miller here is very engaging and delightful, quite reminiscent of Irene Dunne in manner and delivery. Sad she does not dance as that is her forte. SALLY remains her finest film, with this trailing as second and the rather poor SUNNY a vastly inferior runner up.

Alas, it just did not work for me, and by the end of the film I was quite disappointed.For the first three quarters of this movie or so I thought the story lacked any real suspense. Lugosi was doing a pretty good job of holding things together as the somewhat mad Dr. Vollins, some sort of surgical genius who falls in love with a young woman Irene Ware he treats after a car accident but who cannot have her  partly because she is already engaged, and partly because her father Samuel S. Hinds disapproves. To deal with that situation, he enlists the aid of Edmond Bateman Boris Karloff  a horribly ugly man who wants Vollins to make him look more acceptable. Aside from Lugosis performance, though, I found little to hold my interest. Then, suddenly, in the last fifteen or twenty minutes, the movie shifts around completely. Suddenly it becomes quite suspenseful, but I thought Lugosis performance fell apart, largely because the movie tried to shift him from mad to insane  and there is a difference. He plays the mad role very well  controlled and in control but evil. Insane is a more out of control evil, and I did not think Lugosi pulled that off well. At one point, he offers some maniacal laughter which just comes across as fake. In the meantime, Karloff was a huge disappointment. He never grabbed me at all. As an aside, it must have grated on Lugosi that  in movies in which they costar  Karloff gets the top billing, even though in The Raven it is clearly Lugosi who is the lead actor. This surely gives a hint as to how Universal ranked their two great horror stars  inexplicably, I would add, because I have always thought of Lugosi as the better actor of the two.In any event, there is no real connection here to Edgar Allen Poes story The Raven  except that Vollins is a Poe fanatic, who tries to recreate some of the torture techniques from Poes stories.

I ended up paying a bit more than that to import what is one of the worstquality DVDs I have yet seen, of this film or any film in existence. Even when you ignore the fact that the DVD is clearly sourced from an interlaced master and just plain nasty to watch in motion, the film has no redeeming qualities save Annas presence to make watching a top quality BluRay transfer worthwhile. Not that this is any fault of the other actors. Liev Schreiber, Diane Lane, Tovah Feldshuh, and Viggo Mortensen all score high on the relative to Anna Paquin acting ability chart. Far more so than Holly Hunter or Sam Neill did in spite of an equally lousy script, anyway. Director Tony Goldwyns resume is nothing to crow about, but Pamela Grays resume includes Wes Cravens most dramatic excursions outside of the horror or slasher genre, so one could be forgiven for thinking this is a case of bad direction.As I have indicated already, the sole reason I watched this film is Anna Paquin. In her acting debut, she literally acted veterans of the industry with a minimum of twelve years experience above hers under the table. While she is not as far ahead of her castmates here, her performance as a girl that starts the piece as a brat and grows into a woman whose world is crashing down around her proves her Oscar was no fluke. For some time I have been stating to friends that she would be the best choice to portray the heroine of my second complete novel, and a dialogue seventythree minutes into this film is yet another demonstration of why. This woman could literally act the paint off walls. Anna aside, only Liev Schreiber comes close to eliciting any sympathy from an audience. Sure, his character spends the vast majority of the film neglecting a wife with an existential crisis, but he plays the angered reaction of a man who feels cheated brilliantly. I should know, even if it is not from the same circumstances here.Viggo Mortensen also deserves credit for his portrayal of a travelling salesman, although perhaps not to the same extent. In a manner of speaking, he is the villain of the piece, but he successfully gives the character a third dimension. Yes, his actions even after the whole thing explodes are underhanded, but not many men would act any differently in his situation. Nobody wants to be the other man in this kind of messedup situation, so Viggo deserves a lot of credit for giving it a try here. Unfortunately, these are all participants in a story about a woman who feels trapped in a stagnant marriage where Tovah Feldshuh tells us that the Mills And Boon archetype of women being the only ones who feel life is passing by simply does not exist. Either writer Pamela Gray or director Tony Goldwyn thought they could just put this line into the film without thinking of how the audience might receive it. Anna even gets to speak the mind of the audience when she asks Diane who she is to be lecturing anyone about responsibility.That said, the film does have a couple of things besides Anna going for it. Mason Darings original music, while not standing out in any way, gives the film a certain feeling of being keyed into the time depicted that helps where the other elements do not. Roger Ebert is right when he points out that while Liev is a great actor, putting him alongside Viggo in the story of a woman forced to choose between her marriage and her fantasy is a big mistake. He is also very correct in that when the film lingers over scenes of Lane and Mortensen skinnydipping or mounting one another under a waterfall, it loses focus from being a story of a transgression and becomes soft porn. The film seems terminally confused about the position of its story. No matter how many times I rewatch Lievs scenes, I cannot help but feel he has been shortchanged in the direction or editing. One does not have to make their leads particularly handsome or beautiful, but taking steps to make them the most interesting or developed characters in the piece would have gone a long way.Ebert also hits the nail right on the head when he says that every time he saw Anna on the screen, he thought her character was where the real story lay. Stories about the wife feeling neglected and running into the arms of a man who seems interesting or even dangerous are a dime a dozen, to such an extent now that even setting the story in parallel with an event as Earthshattering as the moon landing will not help. In spite of feeling revulsion at the manner in which her characters story is presented, Anna might as well be walking around with a neon sign above her head asking the audience if they would not prefer to see the whole thing through her eyes. While I am all too aware that it is difficult to control exactly which character your audience will find the most interesting from your cast, it is very much as if they did not bother to try with Lane and Schreiber. Fans of these two would be well advised to look elsewhere. Hopefully by now my ramblings about the respective performances will give some idea of where the whole thing went wrong.I gave A Walk On The Moon a three out of ten. Anna Paquin earns it a bonus point with one of her best performances and that is saying something.","label":0},{"index":2355,"txt":"The only redeeming qualities this movie has are the fairly original death scenes.

It jars with the rest of the movie and is possibly off putting to the menopuasal women who were 20 something in 1969 . I say possibly because the movie also seems to aim at a teeenage market with the coming of age scenes and those teenagers will probably be bored with the historical and social context of man walking on the moon and Woodstock . In other words A WALK ON THE MOON tries to attract many types of audience but will probably appeal to none of them","label":0},{"index":2359,"txt":"Recently, I had opportunity to view a working print in Kansas City Olathe, KS. of this title. It is difficult for me, being a lover of the art as I am, to report the following, but, the truth sometimes hurts, and quite frankly after sitting through this tripe I am using the slang definition here  worthless statements or writing for an hour and a half, I feel obligated to share WARN any interested parties. Let us begin at the beginning, a good place to start as always. The first 15 minutes are not really that bad, a couple of laughs, and decent development, but then it is downhill from there. This is the story of a woman, in her mid thirties, that as the writer would like for you to believe is dissatisfied with her life and unfulfilled. The first major difficulty occurs when if you do not know that fact going into the movie, you will not know it when she suddenly risks it all for, in my opinion, a very unkempt and unlikely fling with a local salesman. There is little development drastically insufficient development to justify her actions for the affair she has, and when it occurs, one feels, as I did, that she is just of low moral character. The word slut comes to mind, hopefully, they will let that pass the review and post the comment. This, in my opinion, is the first fatal flaw of the film. If you are married or have ever been in love, irregardless of whether you are male or female, its going to turn you off. Quite frankly, I feel that it would have made a much better blue movie  that is the level in my opinion of which the screenplay is deserving. The second fatal flaw is the casting, Diane Lane just did not work for me here, and Viggo Mortensen is not the right man for the job, believe me. The only saving grace to the entire film is Anna Paquin, the depth of her ability as a fine actress shines in places, conveying a subtle yet very blunt I apologize for the dichotomy but it is accurate portrayal of an emerging teen. Bravo, well done. I am not going to give the ending away, but I was disappointed, being billed as a slice of life romance is one thing... but an ending like that.... Well, if that teased you enough to see this picture, do not say I did not warn you, but you better look fast  if this celluloid is released, I doubt it goes four weeks before bursting into flames. I would say wait for the video, but the free sex education tapes at most video rental outlets have more entertainment value. Hmmm, Dustin Hoffman produced this, you think he would learn after Ishtar. This film once carried the working title Blouse Man and should have been left on the rack. If you have never in your life wanted to walk out on a film, give this one 3540 minutes, the only thing worth staying for is Anna Paquin, if you can stomach the fact that you will find your mind drifting to whether or not you took out the garbage before you left home, which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place if you are off to the movies to see this one. That is my two cents, for what it is worth.","label":0},{"index":2360,"txt":"Any movie that portrays the hardworking responsible husband as the person who has to change because of bored, cheating wife is an obvious result of 8 years of the Clinton era.It is little wonder that this movie was written by a woman.","label":0},{"index":2361,"txt":"Why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others?

Not a DoP, not a director, no one who even remotely had a clue what acting was. It was a very poor cinematic experience; one of my worst.This was about the worst suckfest I have seen, next to Terror Toons which is second only to Killer Klowns from Outer Space.

For you see, the notorious demigod Lucio Fulci did not only produce this movie, he also took the liberty of reusing the most sadistic killing sequences in his own and more easily traceable Cat in the Brain. The opening scene already, in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe, features in Fulcis later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments. Andrea Bianchis Masssacre fails miserably as a giallo, since the search for the sadistic killer among a moviecrew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful, but it is still good entertainment if you are into cheap n shlocky horror trash. The incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters whore all potential maniacs, but none of the red herrings Biachi comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately. Whatever remains to enjoy are the truly misogynous makeup effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast. Whenever there is not any bloodshed on screen, like between the first and second murder, Massacre is a slow and almost intolerable with its inane dialogs and thoroughly unexciting photography. Thankfully in the second half, there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes. The music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative. My advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned Cat in the Brain. That one features ALL the great moments of Massacre, and then some.","label":0},{"index":2365,"txt":"Prior to this film, I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi the trashy zombie flick Le Notti del Terrore 1981, famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from manchild Peter Bark, and the enjoyably sleazy giallo Strip Nude For Your Killer. Neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema, but both were entertaining in their own special way and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity did not hurt. Massacre, however, is dull, dull, dull, despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh.The story, about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot, is confusing and ohso boring when the blood is not flowing and the skin is not on show, the film is a real struggle to sit through it took me four attempts to finish, with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of note.The only point of interest about the film is that its producer, Lucio Fulci, used several of its death scenes to pad out his megagory movie Cat In The Brain AKA Nightmare Concert. And if you have already seen that film, then there is very little reason to bother with Massacre.","label":0},{"index":2366,"txt":"Overall this movie is dreadful, and should have never been made. One of the problems with this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters, for example, if she is about to be attacked, you want to feel, Oh My God, No!, but you do not in this case, you do not care because there is no link that has been made to know the character. In the trailer, it seemed as though the movie would be great, yet there is no suspense what so ever really. There could have been maybe some mystery but there is not. All she has is a toolbox. was said on the DVDs back, you would think that it was carefully planned this movie, and cleverly made, but it is not, The ending, was just awful, very straight forward, and pointless too. The acting is either average or below average, maybe even lower. In my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life. The Special Effects and sets were average too, nothing special what so ever. There is not much gore, or bloody violence, not much blood is shown. This movie was advertised to make it sound quite amazing, yet really, its not even worth looking for, I do not recommend this to anyone, unless they are easily satisfied, by a few fights and a boring story.","label":0},{"index":2367,"txt":"Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi Burial Ground and produced by legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci. Now with this mix of great talent you would think this movie would have been a true gore fest. This could not be further from that. Massacre falls right on its face as being one of the most boring slasher films I have seen come out of Italian cinema. I was actually struggling to stay awake during the film and I have never had that problem with Italian horror films.Massacre starts out with a hooker being slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax. This scene was used in Fulcis Nightmare Concert. This is not a bad scene and it raises your expectations of the movie as being an ax wielding slaughter. Unfortuanitly, the next hour of the movie is SO boring. The movie goes on to a set of a horror film being filmed and there is a lot of character development during all these scenes but the characters in the movie are so dull and badly acted your interest starts to leak away. The last 30 minutes of the movie are not so bad but still could have been much better. The gore in the movie was pathetic and since Fulci used most of the gore scenes in Nightmare Concert there was nothing new here. The end of the movie did leave a nice twist but there was still to much unanswered and the continuity falls right through the floor.This was not a very good film but for a true Italian horror freak like myself this movie is a must have since it is very rare. 410 stars","label":0},{"index":2368,"txt":"Kevin Spacey is very talented, but unfortunately directing is not his forte. I had high expectations about the film before I rented it and maybe that is why I disliked it so much. I admire Spaceys attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting, but it is not the attempt that counts. I found the film dull, boring, and stretched out. The acting was nothing spectacular. Gary Sinise has done much better, especially since he is conscious in most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but this was one of his first films I did get a kick out of how young and chubby this Scream star looked. The only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above. The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck. However, that shot was very Usual Suspectsish and my guess is Spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his which is very good mind you. If you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting, watch Hitchcocks Lifeboat. Maybe Spacey should have watched it before filming this.","label":0},{"index":2369,"txt":"A trio of lowlife criminals, led by Matt Dillon, botches a latenight burglary.

Of course the police mistake the burglar gang for the terrorist, the real terrorist gets away, and the burglars are forced to take refuge in a small dive of a bar, taking hostages, unaware why the police are so intent on catching them. And guess who else has picked the bar as a sanctuary for the night?Unbelievable? Absolutely. And it goes down hill from there. Spacey did acquire a good bit of acting talent; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen, and M. Emmett Walsh, but they are all wasted. Mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar, all they do for the remainder of the film is argue. Endlessly and aimlessly. Long before the conclusion of the film you have stopped giving a damn about what happens to them.","label":0},{"index":2370,"txt":"by Dane YoussefA gang of crooks. The perfect plan. It all goes wrong. They are in trouble. The police are outside. They are cornered. What are they gonna do now?Sound familiar?The movie seems like it is trying to be a combination of the acting workshop, the indie film and the theater.It is the kind of things that actors loveit is kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting... acting angry, tense, scared, conversing, scheming, planninggiving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up.A trio of crooks, one leader, one goon, one brother, come up with a big heist scheme... and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works. To top things off, there is a bit of a fenderbender and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield.The cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically and leadenly Dinos Last Chance.Spacey, as a director, tries to keep the focus on the actors performances and delivery of dialouge. He pans over to a bright passionred cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering Bogart. And he keeps all the violence offscreen, really.I think that was a mistake. Focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge.The problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role. Matt Dillon Drugstore Cowboy and Wild Things seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang.Gary Sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tagalong with these guys and Joe Mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foulswearing maddog police lieutenant who is all thumbs, but he is not given anything to really do here.William Fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood.And the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this.Spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going. The characters are mostly chatting away, trying to think of a plan... and they are to calm and too articulate. There is even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside, ready to strike. At one point, one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar. Oh brother. Oh bother.These cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up. Should not the holedup crooks be a little scared, a little uneasy? Meanwhile, all the real action is happening inside.Someone whips out a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation offscreen and there is one more casualty that happens that is... well, kinda sad. But...Faye Dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach, improving on her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is fine in a smaller part.A cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look. And so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield. The dialouge is obviously trying to go for a David Mamet approach and it is as profane, but never as realistic or as insightful.The movie feels like too much of what it really is... a really lowbudget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that is not bad, but needs a few more rewrites. Spacey shows he is not a terrible director, but he lacks a sort of feel for shaping a movie and it feels like he is just filming actors act.These actors are all talented and could work with the material, but they all feel out of place. As I said before, the movie really suffers from miscasting. I do not mean that the wrong actors were cast. I think they found just the right cast, but placed them in all the wrong roles. I think switching some of the roles would have helped immensely.Having veteran mob actor Joe Mantagna play the leader of the pack, Gary Sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops, keeping Fischter in his bloodthirsty goon part and Matt Dillion as the sacrificial lamb. That would have been a big improvement.When some actors direct, it works. They can even win Oscars for it. But a lot of the time, when actors direct, they have a tendency to just focus on the performances. Just shoot the actors acting.Sometimes it works... but they need a good showcase for it. An excuse for it.Hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like comingofage stories so it is only natural that movies about them will go from point A to point B as well.There are a few really great entries into this genre. Spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations The Negotiator.This certainly will not become a cult classic, let alone one of AFIs 100. Still, it does have a few nice moments and personal touches, but in the end, it is instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular TV. It is just not worth going out of your way to see.I give a 3 out of 10. Spaceys other directorial credit, Beyond The Sea was reportedly a better effort. Hmmm... maybe it is true.

In a film where there is not much action and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of locations, it is imperative that suspense and continuity are provided by the director. Not so here, the great cast is horribly underused, none more so than the great, late John Spencer, the plot is so run of the mill and nothing you have not seen in a hundred other TV movies.

I think eventually parents and film makers alike got sick of it because all we had in reality was abunch of kids going around punching and hitting everyone.Many kids movies have some big point they are trying to make and its nice for your kids to watch and get the message, this one does not have any message at all...it just exploits a million difference things in less than 90 minutes.The movie has no great visual qualities but would one expect it to? The acting is pretty bad. Victor Wong is a cool actor but it was embarrassing to see him here.. The short, fat, gimped eyed old fart as a powerful ninja that was just hilarious.

They had no direction because the script was a halfbaked zombie fantasy with no sense of real cinematic storytelling. Characterization is thin at best, no thanks to weak dialogue and soporific direction. Have I mentioned yet that the script and the direction are pretty lame? They are. There is no drama, no tension, no great character moments, nothing. The whole premise of government suppression of the media is squandered on sophomoric commercial breaks and an undramatic storyline that defies rational analysis and awkwardly shambles to its ridiculous finish. Syd Fields would not be pleased.How could the government suppress the truth of a virulent zombie epidemic when the reality of it would be apparent everywhere? Why would they give it more than a cursory try? In this day and age of cellphone cameras with wireless access, what could they possibly hope to accomplish for more than a day or so at best? Now, if they were covering something up, like their own culpability....but Feeding the Masses never explores such possibilities. Instead, it dwells on absurdity and poorly staged events to dig for laughs andor significance, praying its audience will not notice the near total lack of production value beyond basic filmmaking equipment. Did anyone in this film get paid? I hope the actors did, if only for their time wasted on career blind alleys like this one; at least the techies got to rack up some legitimate work experience.Even zombie fans will find little to gain from Feeding the Masses.

The idea that somebody holds it in higher regard than anything by George Romero is justification enough for the reviewer to be committed to a mental institution. The script is atrocious on its own, like it was written by a sixth grader.As for special effects, I understand that independent films have low budgets, and some gore effects looked acceptable, but if you want a scene with fire, heres a tip buy some nonflammable material, have an extinguisher ready, and get a fire going! Do not digitally add it in and make it look like an explosion from a Nintendo 64 game. The acting, well let us put it this way. In my summer theater program, a cold reading of the script is, compared to this, The Godfather. I will not even go into the inconsistencies. Find them yourself.What disturbed me the most, though, was when everything was finished after shooting and editing, somebody might have said, Okay, this looks good. Let us release it.

The plot has more holes than I or anyone else could possibly count. For starters, why would the government tell everyone to go back to work when it is not safe? I know the governments supposed to be evil but they do not gain anything by killing the entire population of the country. There would not be anyone to govern! Another thing that I was wondering about, even if the government told everyone to go to work, why would people go if the streets were swarming with zombies? Were the zombies going to hide in the bushes and ambush the unsuspecting people in order to aid the government in their plot to kill everyone on the planet? And how about the ending? That stupid Torch guy sacrifices his life in order to get a few close up shots of the zombies. He probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature. And another thing, why does he say Hindenburg before he dies. The Hindenburg was a rare event seen by a very few people. The zombie menace will been seen by everyone in the country, possibly the world. He does not think anyone else will get a few snapshots? They also managed to ruin the only semiinteresting scene in the film when the soldier is watching the exotic dancer. Why did the zombie hide behind a curtain for five minutes before attacking the girl? Especially when the zombie could have come through the DOOR. It is probably just something an unintelligent zombie movie fan such as myself would not understand. Every day I pray that God with increase my brain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuances in Feeding the Masses.Anywho, I think it is interesting that this is the first movie that gave me the desire to physically hurt the people involved in the production.

Because in a world where films like While She Was Out can be greenlighted and attract an Oscar winning star like Kim Basinger, a screenplay lacking in character, content and common sense is no guarantee that it will not sell.As so many other reviewers have pointed out, While She Was Out is a dreadfully underwritten WomaninPeril film that has abused housewife Basinger hunted by four unlikely hoods on Christmas Eve. Every gripe is legitimate, from the weak dialog and bad acting to the jawdropping lapses of logic, but Basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise.

That in reality the wife could not defend herself against a little bitty of a thing. That the husband could actually find the nut case attractive at all. That the defense attorney could break every court rule there was and keep on doing it after the judge ordered the blankety blank to shut up.

The car poops out so she walks through the pouring rain. Checks on the children, goes downstairs, and when her husband petulantly asks what she got him at the mall shows him the gun and shoots him at point blank range.The experience with the four punks was supposed to result in personal empowerment for Della. Instead we know that her children will probably spend Christmas in foster care or a group home, because the State will collect them while she answers to murder one charges.

The one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking Ladd and Spano, and their earlier roles. But great is not anywhere to be found anywhere here  story, performances, and particularly the absurd courtroom hijinks. We all know that Perry Mason before Raymond Burr passed the 300lb. mark, and Ben Matlock, are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom, instead of being boringly confined to a lectern. And Matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them, before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of, or shown, them. No reallife judge or prosecutor would stand for this.Both Perry and Ben almost always ended the proceedings by wringing a confession of the real killer. Actually Perry nearly always did this, but often Matlock would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true culprit, pronounce it reasonable doubt, and then leave it to the cops and prosecutors to proceed against the guilty party  sometimes oncamera, sometimes presumed at the end of the show.But that said, Holland Taylors histrionics and the amount of leeway afforded her, in the courtroom portion of this story, made the actions of MatlockMason moreclosely resemble the slow, often boring detail such as seen on Court TV and in reallife courtrooms.Every character in this presentation was either insipid, unsympathetic, obnoxious, boring, improbable  or some combination of two or more of these.The ending was the most banal, absurd, even silly conclusion possible  but again, fascinating because of this.

People start getting killed...by me! HA!Then later, she demands that one of the counselors, Mare, make an apology, to which the girl replies, I would rather die! Sorry, Mare, but you really walked into that one...Two years ago I was a camp counselor at a sleepaway camp similar to the one portrayed in this movie except the camp that I taught at had more than three kids to the 15 or 20 counselors and it also had rules, which the one in the movie does not. This made me notice the myriad of discrepancies in the movie from what camp life is really like. That is okay though, you can hardly make a movie like this with a lot of 9 year olds running around, although there were some 10 or 11 year old kids killed in this movie.

The poster for this movie makes it look like there is going to be some sort of a cross between Jason and Freddy, which is likely to attract moviegoers. There is NOTHING good or entertaining about this movie about this movie. It just makes me sad, just thinking that some people are going to stumble upon Sleepaway Camp II Unhappy Campers 1988 on video or DVD, and waste their time with this sad, cynical, depressing movie.Angela Baker Pamela Springsteen is a camp counselor at Camp Rolling Hills, who hopes that the other campers are as nice as she is, and that they stay out of trouble. Meanwhile, the other campers are realizing that people are disappearing one by one, with Angela making up the excuse that she had to send them home. Could Angela be the killer, who was once a man, who underwent a sex change operation years earlier? Who knows? Who cares?The 1980s was home to a lot of movies that made the cross between the Mad Slasher and Dead Teenager genres, in which a mad killer goes berserk. Some have a plot, some do not, but they are all about as bad as this one. Sleepaway Camp II Unhappy Campers is 80 minutes of teenagers being introduced and then being stabbed, strangled, impaled, chopped up, burned alive, and mutilated. That is all this movie is. It is just mindless, bloody violence.Watching this movie, I was reminded of the Friday the 13th movies, in which the message for its viewers was that the primary function of teenagers is to be hacked to death. The filmmakers of Sleepaway Camp II have every right to be ashamed of themselves. Imagine the sick message that this movie offers for its teen viewers The world is a totally evil place, this movie tells you,  and it will kill you. It does not matter what your dreams or your hopes are. It does not matter if you have a new boyfriend, or a new girlfriend. It does not matter what you think, what you do or what your plans for the future are. You can forget those plans, because you are just going to wind up dead. And the sickest thing isand by not giving too much awaythe movie simply sets up room for a sequel. Well, why not? They have probably and already taken the bucket to the cesspool by making three or four of these movies. I missed out on the original Sleepaway Camp 1983, and, after watching its first sequel, I will hopefully stay away from the other sequels, as well as the original.

I find that the more I watch this kind of movie, the more I am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger.

For one thing, Angela, the murderous counselor, appears to be about the same age as the campers. Having an older, more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film. And then you have the murder scenes. The budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly no pun intended, although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is certainly original.

Of course, I wanted to check it out, as I had heard of the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but have never actually seen any of them for shame, I know. I will note that since I have not seen the original, my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously, because perhaps what I think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchises own design.Now I am assuming that the franchise of Sleepaway Camp is, in itself, a joke on itself. Hell, even the name comes off as an intentional joke. Sleep away camp? It is good fun. I can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value, but that is about as far as I can go. The acting in this movie made the cast of the original Friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of Macbeth. Campy requires bad acting, but come on. Pamela Springsteen as the evil outoftouchwithreality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast. As far as comedy goes, there were a few times where I chuckled, but it was few and far between.Ultimately, SAC II is pretty boring, and I really did want to sleep away the camp. The deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them. If you are looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp, I recommend Club Dread.

Tim Thomerson is still the best thing about this series, but his wisecracking is toned down in this entry. The performances are all adequate, but this time the script lets us down. The action is merely routine and the plot is only mildly interesting, so I need lots of silly laughs in order to stay entertained during a Trancers movie.

I can just picture the cast and crew driving around L.A. with a camcorder, hurling extras in silly monster makeup at poor, longsuffering Tim Thomerson. The stars families actually turn up to play cameos, probably because Full Moon could not afford real extras. Lame effects, lame sets, and a script so convoluted it would take eons to untie all the knots  this must be classic Trancers!And yet...and yet...it rules. Note this is the same thing I say about Trancers IV. I say it because it is true. What can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies, then bust out with quips like, Do not worry ladies, they are biodegradable? Well, lots of things could be better, but anyway this is still good stuff.My only significant reservation is Megan Ward, who really stinks up the joint. She is a lousy rival for Helen Hunts character  they are both young pieces of eye candy, and it would have been more effective if they actually contrasted a bit more. Oh well, you cannot have everything. At least the wonderful plot device of the long second watch is back in place, and we have got more of Hap Ashby, the leastconvincing athlete in the history of cinema oh, wait a minute  he is got a rival in the form of David Ogden Steirs in Creator.I have not seen this lately, but I do seem to remember that Martine Beswick runs away twice during the final battle. Hooray for lousy continuity! Just one of the many highlights in this fine film.","label":0},{"index":2417,"txt":"The original Trancers is not by any means a great movie. It had massive plot holes and very little in the way of internal logic. However, it was entertaining, better done than most lowbudget Bmovies, and could be surprisingly witty. Unfortunately, Trancers II is none of these.Trancers II suffers from many of the same problems of most flop sequels. The plot is thin enough to see through and the writing is insipid. It seems that the people behind this movie felt that bringing the familiar faces of the first movie back would be enough, and did not bother with anything else. Not even veteran Bgrade actors like Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs were able to drag this film out of the muck.A brief plot overview Jack Deth Thomerson is a cop from the future who was sent to 1985 to save the ancestors of members of his government. Trancers II takes place six years after the events of the first Trancers. Jack Deth is married to Lena Helen Hunt, the woman he met in the first movie, and both live with Hap Ashby, the man Deth was sent into the past to protect. It is discovered that the brother of Whistler the bad guy from the first movie has traveled back in time to create an army of Trancers, people turned into mindless killing zombies, to kill Ashby. Complicating Jacks mission is the fact that his first wife, who had died long before Jack traveled to the past, was also sent back to stop Whistlers brother, and now Jack finds himself working with her.I have two real problems with this movie. One is that the method of creating Trancers in this movie is radically different from the methods used in the first movie. What makes it annoying is that, in a rather poor example of Soviet Revisionism, they act like it was always the technique.The other thing that annoys me is that the love triangle between Deth, Lena, and Alice Stilwell Jacks first wife is given very little screen time. This bothered me particularly because it was much more interesting than the actual plot of the movie. It felt like it was just something that was thrown in to fill space in the movie. Alices character in particular seems very unconcerned with the fact that she is reunited with her husband only to find he is remarried, making her either very shallow or very poorly written.The only reason I can think of for watching this movie is if you are interested in watching the entire Trancers series currently totaling six movies. Otherwise, even if you are a fan of the original Trancers, stay away from this tepid sequel.","label":0},{"index":2418,"txt":"Since the 70s, writerproducerdirector Charles Band has been responsible for literally hundreds of sciencefiction, fantasy and horror Bmovies. Some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget to maximum effect; many of them are pretty bad. Trancers 1985 was one of those rare gems.A Terminator style tale of timetravel and action, Trancers saw Tim Thomerson playing Jack Deth, a future cop given the task of tracking down badguy Whistler, who travels into the past by inhabiting the body of an ancestor. Whistler is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers, converting them into obedient zombies the trancers of the title, and attempts to alter the course of history by killing off the ancestors of the leaders of the future. Jack follows him to 1985, determined to stop him.In this 1991 sequel, Jack is still living in 1985. Having destroyed Whistler, he has settled down and married Leena Helen Hunt, the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie. But, for Jack, things do not stay calm for long, and trouble appears in the form of Whistlers brother, E.D. Wardo, who is trying to build a trancer army.Trancers II lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was. The story is difficult to pick up if you have not seen the first film or at least not for a long while, and there is loads of unimpressive action and a few poor special effects. Gone is the inventiveness and wit that made Trancers so much fun; instead we get some cheesy oneliners and a script that feels like it was written onthefly.About the only reason I can give for recommending this film to fans of the genre is the cast, which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of scifi and horror movies Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, Martine Beswicke. Unfortunately, most of them seemed to be having an off day whilst filming Trancers II, and performances are mediocre at best.The Trancers series obviously has its fans; four further sequels have since been churned out.

A similar plot line to Eden Lake drew me to this, but that is where the comparisons end. This is a brainless and dumb film, shockingly scripted and horribly acted by all involved, the doe eyed Disneyesquire twin kids are horrible to watch, but its Lukas Haas as Chuckie, that must take the plaudits in the bad acting department, although he is given a run for his money by the equally awful husband.

The only surprising part of this hit is when after killing all the clich\u00e9d bad guys with the contents of her magic toolbox, she demands Chuckie to fck her, if my jaw had not already been on the floor at this films awfulness, it would surely have dropped and smashed on the floor. even the ending is messed up, all the feminist grannies wanting their pound of flesh are left utterly disappointed..

I do not even think a 2 yearold would be convinced by the ludicrous idiocy that the filmmakers tried to slap together into a story. However, on the positive side, some of the horrifically inane plot twists provide a great deal of humor. For example, Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her back yard! It gets worse and even funnier, but I will spare you.The acting is generally laughable. Most of the kids roles are sort of cute, but not very believable. On the other hand, Annie is pretty awful allaround. The adults do not take their roles seriously at all, but this is largely a good thing. If they would tried to be believable, the film would have been even worse. Which is difficult to imagine.Once you get past the overall crappiness of the movie, there are actually a few standout moments of almostnotcrappiness. The scene where Lady Hogbottoms son runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious, though it is an annoying letdown when they get caught by the police. The butler character, while very minor, is a ray of sunlight that almost, but never quite pierces through the gloom.Watching this movie actually caused me physical pain. Nevertheless, there were a few redeeming parts that made it almost watchable without beginning to hemorrhage internally.

His use of flashy stylistics in a good number of his movies seems to scream Look at me, are not I an imaginative director?. His best film that I have seen is the one with the least added flourishes, the superlative Raging Bull.For this remake it appears it was business as usual, though. The dull film stock to convey a 1950s setting was so bland as to be a distraction in itself. The melodramatic closeups combined with the subpar imitation of the classic Psycho score are more likely to provoke smirks of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror. The score for Psycho was brilliantly unnerving, this homage just sounds shrill and annoying. Even the cast, who can be decent at times, deliver histrionic performances that just scream caricature; the notable exception to this being an intelligent turn by Lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the Bowden family.The worst acting offender here is surprisingly De Niro. Sure, he looks suitably menacing but as soon as he opens his mouth that aura just drains away. Now I am no expert on American accents, me originally coming from near Manchester in England an all, but surely he could have come up with a more convincing Southern drawl than that? Being the gifted physical actor he is, he almost overcomes this fatal flaw, but not quite. It was disconcerting for me, as a De Niro fan, to be wishing he was off screen, rather than rapt at his performance.POSSIBLE SPOILERS.The overthetop style of the whole movie extends to the ridiculously overblown finale. When will Scorsese learn that underplaying the situation can sometimes build tension just as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and sonic bombardment?

There were other similar problems with the movie which would have been all right if there was some kind of moral to take away from the movie but the few moral questions like whether it was right to try to killbeat Kady before he did anything illegal were presented a little one sided since Kady ended up being just a crazed bastard bent on revenge so sure the lawyer was justified in protecting his family since waiting for Kady to actually rape his daughter so he could do something legally about it would be a bit absurd.

Mmm\u0085 to tell the truth the films title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic, but simplicity can have its strengths.

Not the worse despite being engulfed by negatives, but there is easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm, but compact and unbalanced latenight survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid, when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car park.The problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material taken from a short story, along with the very variable performances. The flimsy script was poorly thoughtout which is not so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off, so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events. As for the bunch of stereotypical goons led by an unconvincing Lukas Hass as a loose canon terrorizing Basinger, well they were less than threatening, but hopelessly clueless. Watching Basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand do not ask me why? knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it did not elicit tension or emotion\u0085 but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up. Basingers performance is stoutlike, but does not craft much empathy. Craig Sheffer shows up as her hotheaded husband. Strangely I could not keep my eyes off the screen\u0085 thinking to myself that red toolbox is hypnotic why would she be constantly carrying it and what tool was she going to use to dispatch the next thug\u0085 her choices were quite disappointing. Watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty, due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles ahead.Susan Montfords soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy, as it pretty much chugs along. I liked the opening credits though, with its hauntingly sullen score which is the most effective thing throughout the feature and polished photography.No great shakes.

Not only am I a huge fan of the Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck starred Cape Fear, but when Scorsese includes scenes right out of the previous film Cady taking the keys out of the ignition, dog dying and even using Bernard Herrmanns score throughout the entire film, he is not giving me a lot of opportunities to not make a comparison as I cannot help but think of the classic Cape Fear nearly every scene. When comparing Scorseses version of Cape Fear to the classic version, the remake comes out destroyed by the classic; but even when taking the film by itself, it is still bad.Now Scorsese and screenwriter Wesley Strick did not just remake the 1962 Cape Fear scene for scene, they tried to do things differently. Unfortunately this is one of the films problems. Gone is the original crazy and animallike Max Cady who is out for personal revenge, the Max Cady in the 1991 version is a religious fanatic out to save Sam Bowden and who is in touch with his feminine side his words, not mine. Also gone is the standup and strong Sam Bowden seen in the classic Cape Fear film, the Sam found in the 1991 remake is very goofy, Magoo, distrustful, and very unlikable. Even Mrs. Bowden is a completely different character  she is crazier than Max Cady is! The overall story has also been changed around  Sam did not testify against Cady in court to put him in jail like in the classic version, Sam is now Cadys exlawyer who Cady suspects of not doing all he could to keep him out of jail and is out to save him.The overall story has been changed, and I do not hold too much against it, but the overall script is also weak all around. Other subplots have been thrown into the mix that not only distract from the bigger picture, they are also just poorly written. The film also includes a few frankly absurd scenes and is filled with apathetic and even ridiculous lines that you cannot take the least bit seriously. These aspects take away from the dangerous and thrilling nature that the film is supposed to have, but they have some help in this department as well.Now the classic version of Cape Fear was extraordinarily filmed with brilliant lighting and a powerfully effective suggestive subtlety combined with a barefaced brutality that delivered thrills when the film called for it and a sense of danger throughout its entirety. However, Scorsese is unable to do any of this in his Cape Fear, giving the film a cookiecutter early 1990s look, no sense of danger, no suspenseful scenes, and little style unless you count animating fire and the skyline style. Yeah, there is some gruesome violence and some effort was put in to make this Cape Fear bigger than the original, but it ends up empty and all shock but no awe.If all that was not enough, the acting is not great either. Robert De Niro being somehow nominated for an Academy Award for his performance starts off alright as Max Cady, but he gets progressively worse until he begins to get nothing but laughs instead of scares by the end of the film. The opposite thing happens for Jessica Lange and her performance of Mrs. Bowden, going from overacting for most of the film to giving a convincing display of fear and desperation towards the end. As Sam Bowden, Nick Nolte stays the same throughout the whole film beige. Juliette Lewis who also reeled in an Academy Award nomination is decent enough in her role as Danielle Bowden, but she is called upon to play a real stupid character and it is hard to really like what we see on screen from her.This film seems to be often counted as one of the few good remakes, and I cannot figure out why. I wanted to like it; I really did  I mean, if there is going to be a remake of Cape Fear I would rather like that one too  but I just could not. Containing nothing to be great on its own and being crushed by the unavoidable comparison to the original Cape Fear, I found Martin Scorseses Cape Fear to be a very bad film indeed. The best things about the film are Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck in their supporting roles  go figure.","label":0},{"index":2435,"txt":"I think we all begin a lot of reviews with, This could have made a GREAT movie. A demented excon freshly sprung, a tidy suburban family his target. Revenge, retribution, manipulation. Martys usual laying on of the Karo syrup. But unfortunately somewhere in Universals highrise a memorandum came down everyone ham it up.Nolte only speaks with eyebrows raised, Lange bitches her way through cigarettes, Lewis Ohmagods! her way though her scenes, and Bobby D...well, he is on a whole other magic carpet. Affecting some sort of CajunHuckleberry Hound accent hybrid, he chomps fat cigars and cackles at random atrocities such as Problem Child. And I want you to imagine the accent mentioned above. Now imagine it spouting brainclanging religious rhetoric at top volume like he swallowed six bibles, and you have De Niros schtick here. Most distracting of all, though, is his most OVERDONE use of the De Niro face he is so lampooned for. Eyes squinting, forehead crinkled, lips curled. Crimany, Bob, you looked like Plastic Man.The story apparently began offscreen 14 years earlier, when Nolte was unable to spare De Niro time in the bighouse for various assaults. Upon release, he feels Noltes misrep of him back then warrants the terrorizing of he and his kin. And we are supposed to give De Niros character a slight pass because Nolte withheld information that might have shortened his sentence. De Niro being one of these criminals who, despite being guilty of unspeakable acts, feels his lack of freedom justifies continuing such acts on the outside. Mmmkay.He goes after Notles nearmistress in a scene some may want to turn away from, his wife, his daughter, the family dog, ya know. Which is one of the shortcomings of Wesley Stricks screenplay utter predictability. As each of De Niros harassments becomes more gruesome, you can pretty much call the rest of the action before it happens. Strick is not to be totally discredited, as he manages a few compelling dialoguedriven moments De Niro and Lewis seedy exchange in an empty theater is the films best scene, but mostly it is all overcranked. Scorseses cartoonish photographic approach comes off as forced, not to mention the HORRIBLY outdated reworked Bernard Hermann score I kept waiting for the Wolf Man to show up with a genetically enlarged tarantula.Thus we arrive at the comedic portion of the flick. Unintentionally comedic, that is. You know those scenes where something graphically horrific is happening, but you cannot help but snicker out of sight of others? You will do it here. Nolte and Lange squawking about infidelity, De Niros thumbflirting, he crossdressing, and a kitchen slip on a certain substance that has to be seen to believed. And Bobs infernal, incessant, CONSTANT, minddamaging, noendin sight blowhard ramblings of all the philosophy he disovered in prison. I wanted him killed to shut him up more than to save this annoying family.I always hate to borrow thoughts from other reviewers, but here it is necessary. This really is Scorseses version of Freddy Krueger. The manner in which De Niro relishes, speaks, stalks, withstands pain, right down to his oneliners, is vintage Freddy. Upon being scalded by a pot of thrown water You trying to offer sumpin hot? Please. And that is just one example.Unless you were a fan of the original 1962 flick and want a thrill out of seeing Balsam, Peck, and Mitchum nearly 30 years later or want a serious headshaking film experience, avoid a trip to the Cape.","label":0},{"index":2436,"txt":"Look, I know this may suck right now, but pain is temporary, film is forever. Whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come. \u0096 Robert De NiroThis was initially a film for Steven Spielberg, the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes. And so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison Robert De Niro. Like Jurassic Park, Poltergeist and War of the Worlds, the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast, the beast being the creation of the father, a lawyer who failed to defend De Niro during his trial. In typical Spielberg fashion, the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and virtually every daddy figure in Spielberg land, the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that Spielberg so enjoys.But Spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to Martin Scorsese, who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare. The result is arguably the worst film in Scorseses filmography, and, ironically, his most illuminating.An artists failures or misfires are often very revealing, exposing the inner workings of their art. When the story does not work, the characters do not connect or the images do not sear, we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core. This \u0096 the remaining carcass is what the directors cinema is about.Now Cape Fear is an impersonal film, so we will not find any thematic connections to the rest of Scorseses filmography You already sacrificed me! De Niro yells, but the films themes of Catholic redemption are cookie cutter. What the film does, though, is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on. Watch how Scorseses camera desperately whips back and forth, how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention. But more importantly, watch how the film makes no spatial sense. A showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious soundstage, a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the familys house does not seem to exist anywhere in particular. There is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture, Scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment. The reason for this is that Scorseses camera always has to be bound, or intimately tethered, to his central character. For the world around the character to make sense, his camera has to be focused on the character. Resnais can take you around a French Hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building, Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic, Scott can recreate an entire future cityscape, Lucas can give you an alien desert planet, and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook close upmid shotwide shot combinations, but Scorsese cannot do this. There is no poetry, no sense of tangible space in his films. He is all about the character. You break that tether, you leave that boxing ring, that taxi cab, you look away from De Niro, and everything collapses. He simply cannot break away from this very documentarian style of shooting, which, in a way, is a prerequisite for action filmmaking.Scorsese tried to rectify this problem with Gangs of New York, where the space and the sets become the central character, but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of Daniel Day Lewis, the actor drawing Scorseses camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb.510 \u0096 Even as a generic Bmovie, this is an ugly, vulgar looking film. Look at the matte paintings, the inept attempts at tension, the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown. Still, we have Robert De Niro to pick up the slack. De Niro, who gives his body over to Scorsese like a tattooed Christ, gives the film its only great scene. In an improvised romantic sequence with young a Juliette Lewis, he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her. A kind of symbolic rape, the girl runs away, both aroused and repelled by this mans interest.But De Niros performance, so deliciously over the top, simply cannot be imitated by Scorsese. You would need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like De Palma to make this work. But Scorsese? Nope.Worth one viewing.","label":0},{"index":2437,"txt":"The film starts with a voice over telling the audience where they are, and who the characters are. And that is the moment i started to dislike the movie. With all the endless possibilities any film director have in hand, i really find it a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice over telling everything. I actually believe voice overs are betrayals to the film making concept.I hate to hear from a voice over saying where we are, which date we are at, and especially what the characters feel and think. I believe that a director has to find a visual way to transmit the feelings and the thoughts of the characters to the audience. But after the bad influencing intro, a very striking movie begins and keeps going for a fairly long enough time. The lives of a middle class family and all the members individually are depicted in a perfect realistic way. I think the director has a talent for capturing real life situations. For example, a father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom might seem abnormal at first, but life itself leads us some situations which might seem abnormal but also very normal as well. I think the director is a very good observer about real life.But that is it. After a while the realism in the movie begins to sacrifice the storytelling. I really felt like I am having a big headache because of the nonstop talking characters. It was as if the actors and actresses were given the subject and were allowed to improvise the dialogs. It is realistic really, but characters always asking really, is that so etc. to each other, or characters saying no or are you listening to me, ten times when saying it only once is just enough causes me to have a headache.I also think the play practicing and book reading scenes are more then they should be.

The original script for First Blood had John Rambo committing suicide at the end of the film, but this was changed to allow him to live, not because the producers wanted to make a sequel but because test audiences found the original ending too depressing. Nevertheless, someone obviously thought that the character was too good to waste, because he ended up as the hero of two more films in the eighties, plus the recently released fourth instalment.The official title of this film was Rambo First Blood Part II, but it is more commonly known simply as Rambo. It starts with the title character in jail, where he is presumably expiating the crimes he committed in First Blood, although this is never made too explicit. He is removed from prison by his former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman, for a secret mission. Rambo is to return to Vietnam to investigate reports that American POWs are still being held captive by the Communist regime. He is under strict instructions not to attempt to rescue any prisoners or to engage the enemy; his is to be simply a factfinding mission.What Rambo does not realise is that he is being set up, not by Trautman, who is portrayed as brave, honourable and incorruptible, but by the organiser of the mission, a military bureaucrat named Murdock. Murdock intends that the mission will prove that there are no American prisoners in Vietnam, partly because that will improve relationships between the American and Vietnamese governments, partly because it will make his own life easier. Unfortunately for Murdock, Rambo discovers that not only are Americans still being held prisoner, they are also being kept in hellish conditions. Of course, he is far too much of a hero to leave them to their fate, and tries to rescue them. The rest of the film is more or less one long battle between Rambo and a few allies including a beautiful Vietnamese girl and the evil commie soldiers and their Russian allies. Most of the evil commies, of course, end up dead, although I was surprised to learn from your trivia section that the total death toll was as low as 67. At times it seemed as though Rambo was trying to wipe out the entire Vietnamese army.The tone of this film is very different from the first. In First Blood Rambo was unquestionably a criminal, even though his responsibility for his crimes was lessened by severe provocation and by his mental instability. In Rambo he is a bona fide allAmerican hero. A few years earlier the director, George Pan Cosmatos, had made The Cassandra Crossing, a biased piece of leftwing antiAmerican propaganda. Cosmatos, however, was nothing if not versatile, and Rambo proves that he could also turn his hand to biased rightwing proAmerican propaganda. The one thing the two films have in common is that both are laughably bad.First Blood had its faults, but it also had its virtues. Its stance, that the antiwar movement was partly to blame for the problems faced by Vietnam vets in readjusting to civilian life, was a controversial one, but at least the film was trying to make a statement about war, social attitudes to war, and the roots of violence in society. Rambo, by contrast, has very few virtues, except that the action sequences are well enough done to please those who like that sort of thing. It is essentially a sort of jingoistic revenge fantasy for those Americans who were still sore about the Vietnam war. Rambo refights the war singlehanded, and this time the right side wins. Take that, Charlie Cong! By this point, no doubt, the films admirers and there seem to be plenty more than 2,000 voters have already given it ten stars will have concluded that I am a liberal commieloving pinko. Far from it in fact, I have always despised Communism as a pernicious ideology. What I dislike about the film is not its politics but its lack of subtlety and its suggestion that the solution to all problems, including ideological disputes, is to go in with all guns blazing and to try and kill as many people as possible. It makes no attempt to understand the political complexities of SouthEast Asia or why not everyone in the region was proAmerican. For all its antiCommunism, the film is the sort of moronic sledgehammer propaganda that the Communists were very good at churning out themselves except that they attributed all the worlds problems to Capitalism, or Imperialism, or Revisionism, or whatever other ism they had taken a dislike to.

If not because of the fact that tens of thousands of American soldiers went MIA in Vietnam, or the manner in which those who returned were treated, then because it was the first war that America could be said to have lost. Many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves, and the original First Blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world, as the saying goes. First Blood Part II, on the other hand, is little more than a fistpumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore America can be, both in victory and defeat. Stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular Special Forces commando, while Richard Crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient. Where it all comes undone is in the script, which did not do any better when it was called Missing In Action and starred Chuck Norris. What little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone, as the filmmakers decide to paint a big S on Rambos massive chest.The film picks up a little while after the end of First Blood. The film, that is  the novel did not allow for the possibility of sequels. In this mediocre followup, Rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of openair mine. As he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat, a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with Colonel Trautman, who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission. Rambo, never one to back down from a hard days violent work, accepts, and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be Cambodia or Thailand I forget which. From there, he is commissioned to seek out a camp where American MIAs are supposedly being held, and photograph them. His mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release. Rambo being Rambo, however, has other ideas in spite of their possible political implications.Of course, things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning Rambos work have more interest in making sure no American MIAs are found. It is the ageold conspiracy theory, and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an American family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official Vietnam war had been raging for. Of course, with the Jingoism that was inherent in American society during the 1980s, they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the Vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of Russians. Together, the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from Rambo, but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets, arrows, rockets, and destruction. About the only thing missing is the moment when Rambo drinks from a graillike chalice and declares himself invincible.To be honest, First Blood Part II is a wellphotographed, and wellchoreographed, action spectacle. The handtohand combat with the larger Russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever. The rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for Americans to pump their fist to. Fortunately, this fad of America \u00fcber alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as Platoon began doing the rounds. Some of the kills shown here are quite creative, despite all the problems. The Vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy. The Russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous. Only in a 1980s action film would one see a LAW being used from inside a helicopter. Sure, there have been action film clich\u00e9s rooted in contradictions of fact, but never this ridiculous before.I gave Rambo First Blood Part II a one out of ten. It is so bad it is ridiculous, and so ridiculous that it is often funny. One does not even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are. The only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved.

Aiding him in his quest is a lady soldier with local knowledge, the beautiful and resourceful Co Bao Julia Nickson. Sure enough, Rambo discovers that there are PoWs in the camp, but he exceeds his orders by rescuing one of them\u0085 when he reaches the rendezvous point, the rescue chopper abandons him on the orders of Murdock who, it seems, does not really want to find any PoWs because of the political and military implications. Rambo is captured by the enemy and tortured, but following an explosive escape he sets out to free the PoWs and get his revenge on the treacherous Murdock.The few good points of the film come from Jack Cardiffs polished photography, Jerry Goldsmiths exhilarating score, and the sheer professionalism of the stunt team in performing various action antics. Beyond these scant pickings, the film is a failure. The actors are reduced to macho posturing, the plot rings false, the action sequences are soulless and suspenseless, the dialogue is absurd\u0085 even the violence becomes numbingly predictable. At the time of its release America was under the presidency of Ronald Reagan, a man with simplistic and nearhysterical anticommunist sentiments. For this reason, contemporary audiences lapped up this Commiebashing shootingfest as if it was the greatest movie of alltime, transforming it into an undeserved box office success. Thankfully times have changed \u0096 nowadays we can look upon it as a simpleminded action flick with a ludicrously high body count, ludicrously dumb politics, and a ludicrous hero.","label":0},{"index":2451,"txt":"I do not see much reason to get into this movie in much detail. Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo, author and survivor of A Season in Hell, recruited from prison by his only friend, Major Richard Crenna, to secretly return to Vietnam, take photos of the American prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps, and return without engaging the enemy.Fat chance. What if he actually DID nothing more than sneak in, take pics, and sneak out? Who would come to see the movie? It is essentially a celebration of Stallones muscles. Preparing for his mission, we see his welloiled muscles bulging. They are oiled and bulging throughout. There is the ritual strapping on of black leather, ugly guns, and even uglier knives. The black guns are cleaned, assembled with loud clacks, and almost as oiled as Stallones muscles. The bow is tested and, yes, it has enough poundage to drive a bolt through an enemys forehead. The knife is sharpened with slick snicks.Stallone and one of his POWs are betrayed by one or two of the suits from Washington, cynical politicians who, you can bet, were never even in a fist fight in grammar school. No guts, you know? Just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beer.The movie does what it set out to do, but what it set out to do is meretricious. It deliberately cashes in on the myth popular in the mid1980s that there were uncountable numbers of MIAs quietly kept in wretched camps by the North Vietnamese. The bumper stickers were ubiquitous. Free Our MIAs. Why would they keep them? It was never quite reasoned out but perhaps to turn the POWs into a slave labor force  in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor. Or maybe for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the United States  a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese kept secret from the world.As a captive, Rambo is treated in a Medieval fashion by the North Vietnamese. Dipped to his neck in pig excrement and then hauled out of it by his wrists, his muscles still on display. Then, not content with subhuman Vietnamese, a Russian officer is brought in to play the part of the Gestapo officer  Vee haff vays of MAKING you remember. A hightech type, the Russian uses psychology and electricity, not just pig dump.Rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until this country loves us as much as we love it, bringing up another myth that Vets returning from Vietnam were uniformly spat upon and cursed, which is why I guess we elected so many to the Congress and appointed others to highechelon positions. The last three losing presidential candidates were among that despised group. At least Rambos aimless drifting left room open for a sequel, which arrived apace.The action movies with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but Rambo is humorless. It marches dully through it is phantasmal ideological swamp, killing without mercy, barely speaking, barely able to speak. To speak is a sign of weakness.","label":0},{"index":2452,"txt":"I remember I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, had a Commodore 64 and loved to play Rambo on it.

The scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers!

This movie is a typical American antiSoviet propaganda. True, this was the peak of the Cold War, but I am sick of having Communists or the Nazis always being shown as the enemy. There are so many American movies that have this one thing in common. Why cannot there a movie that show Americans as the enemy?

The United States clearly did not win the war in Vietnam. They caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the ohso innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation, who made this war happen. The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this. He is extremely patriotic, bemoans that USAmericans did not appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier, but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians. Like every film that defends the war e.g. We Were Soldiers also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in South Asia. And for that matter also the reason for every single USAmerican soldier that was there. Instead, Rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation. It would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories, rather than suppressing them. Do we get to win this time? Yes, you do.","label":0},{"index":2458,"txt":"An offensively overthetop action adventure,FIRST BLOOD PART II seemed to catch the mood of the US at the time of it is release in the mid80s,with rightwing Reaganism and virulent antired feelings still not finished yet,though the emergence of a certain Mikhail Gorbachev in the heart of the Evil Empire in Moscow would soon render these types of films redundant;even Reagan himself eventually admitted this truism.In that sense,we can be most grateful to Gorby,not for his disarmament treaties with the US,nor his policies of glasnost,or even his support of democracy being restored to the Eastern European countries in the former Soviet Unions backyard.No,it is the final diminution of foolish,jingoistic,bloated coldwar adventures like this.The first RAMBO film was hardly perfect,though at least was a mildly literate and adequate action thriller with a not too bad storyline.In this sequel,any sense of even the remotest conviction is instantly jettisoned for silly,senseless plotting and incident in which Rambo singlehandedly takes on scores of brainlessly stereotyped Vietnamese and Russian troops to rescue American POWs ten years after the conflict ended,with the Americans on the losing side.Perhaps the reason why the film was a huge boxoffice success was to let many Americans wallow in fantasy;they may have lost the war,but there was still unfinished business at hand,and ludicrous comicstrip heroics with a robotlike hero killing virtually every red on sight,with as much hardware as possible,fulfilled such whimsically farfetched ideals.This could have been entertaining on a SUPERMANSPIDERMAN level,but sadly everything is played absolutely straight.But that is not to say that there is no humour in the film;sadly it is virtually all of the unintentional kind.The action scenes,though technically adequate,never once carry the slightest bit of conviction or persuasiveness,because they are always placed in the most spectacularly unbelievable of contexts;namely,our hero Rambo is always unscathed aside from a few cuts and bruises here and there despite the tons of explosives,grenades,gunshots,etc.going around him.In between the mayhem,what there is of a script consists of the dullest clich\u00e9s and banalities.Stallone,who cowrote the script with James Cameron a long way from the exciting TERMINATOR made the previous year,deliberately seems to have given the Rambo character as little to say in understandable English,and merely comes out with moronic grunts,almost as though he has invented his own brand of patois only understandable to himself.Maybe his colleague Cameron was thinking of The Terminator again with so little communication involved for the lead character! In this sense Rambo seems even less of a human than the Terminator did! The rest of the cast do little better with good actors like Charles Napier and Richard Crenna doing their admirable best with the hackneyed dialogue they are given,and Steven Berkoff hamming it up outrageously yet again with another of his Russian KGBRed Army villain roles.Berkoffs overplaying is mildly enjoyable but not remotely menacing.How come that Sly managed to survive Berkoffs electric shock torture to kill yet more of those Red Commie scumbags? Well,credibility is never this films strong point.It is a work of fantasy comparable with THE WIZARD OF OZ.At least that WAS meant to be a fantasy,and an immortal classic it turned out to be.This is only a classic of the most dismal,and indeed offensive,kind.And as for Slys climactic speech...,rather hypocritical after slaughtering all those people,eh?

The only woman in the middle of all these boys toys is soon bumped off, allowing the testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script to degenerate into a succession of loud noises. Helpfully supplying a few hackneyed musical cues is Jerry Goldsmith, who carefully checks off all the clich\u00e9d themes from Russian ratatat to Chinese chingchangchong just in case we do not quite understand who we are looking at.

The camera work tries to be too cleaver for it is audience, by constantly using shaky quickcuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing gory or scary to show us. This becomes evident right off the bat, as we are introduced to the wouldbe killer, and soon realize that the acting is the scariest thing happening... After a painfully long title sequence we are brought back to modern times, yet the acting remains the same. Frightworld does generate some rather unique cinematography when showing scenery from inside the funhouse, but with an extremely long running time, it cannot save the film from it is below average indie hell.There is some mediocre nudity, but not much for gore, which is usually the saving grace for these types of movies.Fans of really bad BMovies might find something of interest here, otherwise, do not spend a lot of cash.","label":0},{"index":2464,"txt":"Very bad.

This film is a total disaster from start to finish. For one thing, Barbra was FORTY YEARS OLD when she made it and she looked every minute of it. There was no way anyone could possibly swallow her as a young girl yearning to study Torah. And then when she dresses up as a boy it gets campy. I get the impression that Streisand could not bear to be unattractive so she played around with the makeup; she is prettier as a boy than she is as a girl. And as if that is not bad enough, she gets involved with both her schoolmate Avigdor Mandy Patinkin, whose best moment is the shot of his naked rear end AND his fianc\u00e9e Amy Irving, who does her usual sleepwalker routine, a bit of schtick the poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and she does not know what she is doing.

For starters, there is the constant SINGING. I can already hear the critics shouting. Yes, I know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers. But the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them. The songs become tedious after a while, and there is not as much dancing as one would expect. Many of the songs are forgettable, with no real memorable lyrics, and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voiceover. Only one song stands out from the rest, Papa Can You Hear Me. It is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so Streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes. Chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is, so the songs really are not necessary. Second, Streisands makeup, which can be seen during her scenes as a man the lipstick, enhanced lashes, and traces of blush are all obvious makes it hard for the audience to believe in the YentlAnschel character, that she is actually serious, and fooling her new friends, colleagues, and even Hadass, into believing she is a man. Yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing. There seems to be a contradiction, as her character talks, or rather sings, of how she does not think she can pull it off, but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing mens clothing. This means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they cannot see the other differences, such as her actions, which are clear giveaways. The facial differences alone cannot be included, as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives or friends did not have a beard or other facial hair. Nevertheless, in the 1900s, if a woman dressed as a man, but wore as much makeup as Streisands character did, and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore mens clothing, it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage. Chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town, or even the country. Therefore the feminine makeup on Streisand does not lend to the characters credibility, and only weakens the plot. If it was only applied to make Streisand look more beautiful, it should have been scrapped. Thirdly, when YentlAnschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the end, we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as Streisands and only when they learn the truth do they become a little wiser. By now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custommade vehicle for Streisand to fuel.Lastly, there are those who are fans of Streisand who will find no fault with this film, its plot, or the songs. To those I must respectfully disagree. While she has excellent vocal and acting abilities, I am not a fan of her style of singing. However, I have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals. There are even some songs of hers that I like, so I am not a hater nor have set out to bash her. I have written this review from an honest perspective, from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie  several times even  and has noted the problems within. If Streisand was interested in creating a great or even believable film, she could have done so here by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented, beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn. This movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities, make her appear selfabsorbed, and thus turn the film into a laughfest unworthy of her fans or audience.","label":0},{"index":2476,"txt":"This movie started out good, i felt like i was watching an adult version of Seinfeld.

But since his wifes mysterious death her daughter, Emily, has been emotionally disturbed, so he goes Spoleto, where the problematic picture is, with her and her nanny, Jill. And there is a Countess, who is also a psychic, and she informs him that the picture was somehow made at the night that a young witch named Emilia was executed. Michael does not believe her story, but after that Emily has hysterical spasm and Jill is killed... This Italian film is, of course, almost innocently influenced by THE EXORCIST, but this one is much cheaper, much simpler,and in a sense, much dirtier. First of all, it should be said this film is full of confusion. For instance, the story shows Emily is a reincarnation of Emilia. But when Emily sees her in the flashbacks, she perceives her exclusively from a thirdpersons point of view. But if she is the reincarnation of Emilia, she should and must see the past from nothing but Emilias point of view. Confusions of this kind, which the film has many, are almost exclusively based upon a problematic fact that the film is too cowardly, rather than ambivalent, to specify its own quasiFreudian theme, namely, preadolescent girls oneway incestuous wish. To make matters worse, this film also has characteristic problem if not confusion; every character is too naive and helpless to be realistic andor believable living human. Regarding Emily or Emilia, she is after all a child, and one can say it is difficult to blame her mainly for her naiveness and helplessness. And according to the Freudian theory, every girl wants to have her fathers children in her own way. In this sense, Emily is not exclusively pathological; only her way of excluding other women from her fathers love is problematically pathological. But, as I already mentioned, this film per se is too cowardly to be Freudian. The problem is that adult characters are as childish and naive and helpless as Emily is. And because of this characteristic weakness even the psychic who can see almost everything cannot do anything downtoearth, and because of the same weakness the very story of the film is ended in a badly escapist way. In addition, special effects of this film are incredibly cheap and laughable. Although Stelvio Ciprianis music is noteworthily beautiful indeed this one is so good that it seems to be worth having it alone, the film as a whole is nothing but a cheap Bfilm which can disappoint even the 1970sItalian horrorfilmlovers.","label":0},{"index":2479,"txt":"I saw this movie, and at times, I was unnerved believing this movie saw me.

The plot is as follows. A group of documentary filmmakers head off to an island in order to film a documentary about surfing with sharks or blood surfing. I live in South Africa so it was released as Blood Surf. Admittedly, this seems to have a somewhat interesting idea behind it which, if it were explored further, could have improved the movie somewhat. However, this is not the case as the blood surfing part of the movie is minimal due to the fact that their documentary is interrupted by a rather large saltwater crocodile.The script is absolutely terrible. A good example of this is whenever someone gets eaten by the crocodile which is a frequent occurrence in this film, no one seems to give a damn. The most anyone person did in the film was to merely toast the victim in a scene which was meant to be poignant but just ended up being laughable due to the fact that the dialogue in this film was of a highly dubious nature. Another thing that really irritates about this film is the fact that they introduce characters who are totally superfluous to the film itself. They introduce a bunch of pirates who can only be seen to be adding another 10 minutes to a mercifully short film.The acting can be said to be mediocre. It probably would have been a lot more impressive if they did not have such a terrible script to work from. All in all there is not one person who made a terrible impact on me. Every single person seemed to be a watereddown caricature and in this way, not one of these actors made any sort of impact on me.The crocodile itself is said to be huge, over 31 feet exactly and this sense of size is well portrayed by the obvious fake of a crocodile that they have provided for us in the film. The crocodiles death at the end of the film is so ridiculously fake and contrived that it makes ones stomach turn. With a huge cry of bravado, the hero of the film announces that he has a plan which turns out be falling down a hill and getting the crocodile to impale himself on a luckilyplaced spike at the bottom of this said hill.All in all, I would say that this film is one which has to be seen for you to believe how bad it could be.

A handful of ambitious young people, are trying out a new water sport, surfing in shark filled waters. It soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water. After they learn what, they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman, who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family.I think I have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worse of which is its sequel. Blood Surf would have to be the second worst croc flick I think, with Primeval and Crocodile tailing closely behind.The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year.

The crew plan to shoot an expose on bloodsurfing which is apparently the latest craze in extreme sports. Surfers throw bait into the sea and cut themselves to attract sharks, just to see if they can outsurf them without being eaten. Once there they are greeted by Sonny Lofranco Cris Vertido and his wife Melba Susan Africa. Their search for the perfect location leads them to the shark infested waters of LiloCay. Sonny, Melba and their daughter Lemmya Maureen Larrazabal take them in their boat. Soon after arriving and having already shot some bloodsurfing footage Sonny, Melba and Lemmya are all killed by a 30 foot saltwater crocodile that some say owns the island. The boat is sunk. Zack, Cecily, Bog and Jeremy appear stuck on the island until such time a rescue party arrives. However, after a run in with some, erm well I do not really know what they are. Pirates? Drug smugglers? Revolutionairies? Fat ugly people who just do not like being with other people? Who knows? And more importantly who cares? Not me that is for sure. Anyway, after escaping from these guys who look like pirates, they are picked up just off the coast of the island by Captain John Dirks Duncan Regehr and his girl Arty Taryn Reif as Tara Reif. The film crew believe they have been saved. Little do they know that the crocodile and Captain Dirks go way back and he has a score to settle and four members of a film crew are not going to stop him. Captain Dirks heads back to LiloCay for a final showdown with the giant maneating crocodile.Directed by James D.R. Hickox this is one awful film, but it is still not as bad as Tobe Hoopers Crocodile 2000. Everything about this film sucks. The script by Sam Bernard and Robert L.Levy is terrible, extremely slow as the crocodile is not even seen or mentioned before the 30 minute mark and by that time I was seriously bored and annoyed with the hideously unlikeable characters thought up by Bernard and Levy. The whole film is also frustratingly predictable as well, within the first 10 minutes anyone familiar with horror film stereotypes and stock characters will be able to guess who dies and who will survive. The crocodile effects are awful and seem to be repeated over and over, there is a small puppet head that obviously has someones arm stuck inside it controlling it is movements as the water splashes become huge! The CGI shots of the crocodile are just plain embarrassing to watch. There is no gore apart from when a character is bitten in half which is achieved using CGI to digitally remove the actors legs, again it looks terrible. There is also a brief scene when someone is impaled on wooden spikes when they set a trap off. There is a reasonable amount of nudity and sex, plus the female actresses are nice and easy on the eye. There are basic continuity and logical errors in the film too, in one sequence Cecily is filming Bog and Jeremy bloodsurfing but from the angle and distance she is at it would be physically impossible to obtain footage of both the sharks and surfers at the same time, and surely that is the whole point of her shot? When Dirks manages to harpoon the crocodile the angle of the wire changes dramatically between shots, in one shot the angle of the line looks like it is coming from the sky, in the shot straight after the angle is completely different and it seems as if the line is coming from below the surface of the water when in actual fact the harpoon is attached to the back of the boat and the line should be almost level with the surface. I could carry on, like why does the crocodile jump off the edge of a cliff if it is so smart as this film tries to make out? But I would probably exceed the 1000 word limit if I listed everything that was wrong with this film, so I will not. I hated this film, but rather scarily it is still not as bad as Tobe Hoopers effort at a giant crocodile film.

If it were only for the lack of talent between the actors, the embarrassingly stupid dialogs and the hilariously stupid crocodile, it would be at least worth a laugh, but it gets worse I would guess, the people in charge of this movie noticed how weak it was, so they though up the old idea of sex sells...

First it takes down some secondary characters, then it starts attacking the main characters, usually played by a couple of nobodies except for someone who used to be a bit more famous, who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow, usually with an explosion. Then, we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or has laid eggs, etc. etc. Krocodylus basically uses the same overused ideas, and does absolutely nothing to create even a tad bit of variation.

During the film, he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surferdudes  dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a sharkcongested area. The only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location. Even though it is a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this, the lagoons and nature looks marvelous. Every other aspect is simply disastrous. There is a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable. The dialogues are downright painful to listen to! You will not believe some of the lines these actors have to say! I know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope for their own sake they are not that stupid! Early in the film, one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a mechanical toy but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than Spielbergs great white shark. The visual effects in Blood Surf are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress. I will not say too much about the acting since it is secondary in flicks like this. The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast. You guessed right Blood Surf is a very bad film. So bad it becomes fun again.

Everybody a suspect but all have the usual alibi exgirlfriend student shagging a married teacher so had to lie, disgruntled student who was reported by victim actually had life changing experience, Senators enemy did not pay desperate student to kill sworn enemies son, he gives money freely to lots of broke students. All the while the heroine of this dribble has her niece staying who is at that age and has a crush on a boy, who she eventually gets the courage to talk to with the assistance of her aunty, but only to dump him because the in girls says he is not good enough and so to keep in with them she dumps him. Do not worry, she gets back with boy after she learns the truth about life and the in girls drop her, Aunty also explains that God is the only one who truly she can rely on I was almost sick at this point.This drama gets even better when Sue and her FBI team find out who the killer is . . . your gonna laugh at this, i sure did . . .

The film is content with simpering away 80whatever minutes of time and never really accomplishing anything more than being a sometimes distraction in spite of my best efforts to try and give it a chance, but no dice.There is some offbeat production design going on, the use of lighting is striking at times, and the occasional outburst of mayhem will probably keep fans of 1980s Teen Horror interested.

Renny Harlins superbly gritty and moody Prison got the whole haunted hoosegow ball rolling; it was immediately followed by the markedly inferior The Chair, John Saxons enjoyably trashy Death House, the passable psycho picture Destroyer, and this hideously limpnlethargic exercise in hopelessly comatose tedium. Your usual annoying collection of horribly unsympathetic college student chowderheads lead by insufferably spineless tormented twerp Alex the hugely unappealing Nicholas Celozzi go to Alcatraz Island to investigate the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden gruesome death of upandcoming rock star Sammy Mitchell blandly played by Toni Basil of Hey Micky fame. Alexs brother becomes possessed by the evil demonic spirit of a vicious cannibalistic US Civil War cavalry commandant and goes on the expected killing spree, thus forcing wimpy Alex to overcome his passivity and make a stand against this ghoulish specter.Although slickly photographed by Nicholas Von Sternberg, with a few decent gore set pieces and a fair amount of spooky atmosphere the film was shot on location in the dismal, rusty, rundown ruins of Alcatraz Island, Slaughterhouse rock nonetheless just does not cut it as a solid, effective fright feature. This is largely due to the uniformly obnoxious and unlikeable collegiate smartaleck characters, a tiresomely smirky bunch whose inane comic antics prove to be grating rather than amusing. The flat acting from a noticeably disinterested cast hurts matters all the more, with onetime Playboy playmate and undeniable blonde cutie pie hottie supreme Hope Marie Carlton doing an especially irritating Linnea Quigley impersonation as the token oversexed nympho bimbo. Dimitri Logothetis direction displays a modicum of flashy visual style, but the tone is unevenly pitched between grim seriousness and goofy, horrendously sophomoric silliness, and, most damagingly, Ted Landons sloppy, inconsistent, overly complicated and finally quite confusing script miserably fails to develop the necessary internal logic to make the farfetched story even remotely plausible.

Alas, murky is also the best word to describe the movies plot.

Seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the Eastern seaboard, and one of them a woman, I would guess is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque, tortuous ways.

Let us start at the beginning. First, writerdirector Susan Montford puts Kim Basinger in the tired old victim role, complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence. Let it be said right now that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite. Montfords pathetic attempt at symbolism involving the Christmas tree with no star is laughable.When She Goes Out for some Christmas wrapping paper one dark and ominous night, Della is furious that somebody doubleparked their car on the busiest shopping night of the year. She decides to do something about it, so she leaves a nasty note on the cars windshield. The next fifteen minutes of the movie are devoted to Della walking around aimlessly in the shopping mall. When she finally gets to her car, the thugs confront her about the note, a cop is killed, and she runs, and they catch up to her, and she gets away, and they chase her some more, and on and on. Everything is completely predictable and uninvolving. The thugs are not scary or menacing at all, and they all get picked off one by one in all the usual ways.This is one of those movies in which all the action depends on the characters being as stupid as you can imagine. Why the bad guys do not just kill her instead of waiting for her to hit them with a tire iron is beyond me. And once, just once, in a film like this, does the leader of the pack have to die last? What does it matter that they are all picked off one by one when they are all equally inept? Much of the movie simply consists of Lukas Haas running around in the woods screaming Della!!! And the inclusion of Joy Division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting.The part that really made me run for my computer keypad was when Della, exhausted and hurt, cries out to the heavens, Where are you, God?

She jumps through a window and wakes up, and we see she is very pregnant. The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie.She and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island. Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies! On the island already are David Hasselhoff and his Germanspeaking virgin girlfriend you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff.... He is taking photographs, and she is translating an esoteric German book about witches, I think.Also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it, and a real estate agent, and a woman I thought was their daughter. Evidently she was an architect, and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couples children. I guess they all traveled to the island together, but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them maybe they were filmed separately.The hotel seems neat, certainly from the exteriors, but it is not used to any great effect. An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in German sometimes, which he eventually records on his Sesame Street tape recorder.People start getting killed, either in their dreams, or sucked into hell or something. Some of these gore scenes are OK, but not enough to recommend the movie. Though the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover, the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut. Much of the scene is showing another characters reaction shots, since we are not seeing anything ourselves. The creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messylooking wound of a mouth rapes someone. He looked particularly nasty. There is a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed. I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her, they would do something original with her role, and let her leave Exorcist behind her except for the yearly horror conventions.In the weird, largely Italian, tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to, this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. That is, it is supposedly a sequel to Casa 3  Ghosthouse, La 1988  it is not that is also a better movie than this one. La Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead 1981 and Evil Dead II 1987  again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 and much better than those. There is also a Casa 5, La 1990 AKA House 5, which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House House 1986 House II The Second Story 1987, The Horror Show 1989 AKA House III, and House IV 1992. How is The Horror Show fit in there? It does not really, it claimed to be a sequel, thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less or more? confusion.

Photographer Gary David Hasselhoff, who wants to capture Witch Light, and his virginal writer girlfriend Leslie Cumming, who is studying witchcraft, are shacking up at the hotel without permission. Along comes real estate agent Jerry Rick Farnsworth, who is showing off the property to potential buyers Rose Annie Ross and Freddie Robert Champagne Brooks. Also tagging along are their children; pregnant grown daughter Jane Linda Blair and very young son Tommy Michael Manchester, as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan Catherine Hickland  Hasselhoffs wife at the time. Once everyone is inside, their boat driver is killed hung and the boat disappears, so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the Lady in Black.So what can you expect to find here? Plenty of unpleasantries! One of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slowroasted by the rest of the cast. There is also a crucifixion, witches eating a dead baby, a swordfish through the head, someone set on fire, a possession, a Sesame Street tape recorder, the virgin getting raped by some demon, a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff. From a technical standpoint, it is a nicelooking film with pretty good cinematography, a decent score and good gore effects. The hotelisland setting is also pretty nice. Blair particularly at the end and Ross both seem like they are having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch. Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days, he is not bad in his role, either.On the down side, despite all the gore, the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour. The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing, too. When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy. And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber. And while most of the cast is at least decent, a few of the performances particularly the actress who plays Hasselhoffs girlfriend and the kid are so bad they are constantly distracting.","label":0},{"index":2557,"txt":"Oh my... bad clothing, worse synth music and the worst David Hasselhoff. The 80s are back with vengeance in Witchery, an AmericanItalian coproduction, helmed by infamous Joe DAmato on the production side and shortcareered director thank heavens for small miracles Fabrizio Laurenti directing . Marketed as a kind of sequel to Sam Raimis Evil Dead series in Italy that was dubbed La Casa in there, Witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting.A mix of ghost story, possessions and witchcraft, the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mixups slow it is progress to expectable ending, topped with some serious WTF surprise climax. I just love the look on her face... Surprisingly Laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few  very few  scenes; unluckily for him, these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively.The plus sides are experienced, when the gore hits the fan. This department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80s Italogore, when things were made 100 handmade and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow. I could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the overthetop ways that obnoxious characters and actors got mangled and misused, one by one. I only felt sorry for Linda Blair, who apparently have not been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl  woman role ever in his career, or so it looks like when checking out his filmography.Well, folks  not much more to tell, and even less to tell home about. Do not expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this, and probably you will experience at least some mild fun. It also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80s euro gore horror.

Unfortunately, unbeknownst to the hotels new guests, the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch Hildegard Knef, who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life. One by one, victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs, before meeting a terrible fate.None of this makes much sense, and the acting is atrocious Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad, whilst Hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers, which speaks volumes about the others, but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore Rose has her lips sewn together, before being roasted alive in a fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burnt alive; Linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish!!; Freddies veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood; and Gary gets stabbed in the back.Oh, and Leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and Blair gets possessed again.","label":0},{"index":2559,"txt":"This movie is so bad it is good  in an unintentionally funny way.

At the same time, because of the draft and wars, everyone in society had served, or was connected to someone who had.This allowed for a minigenre based on the notion of American cleverness in the midst of an inflexible military machine. Sometimes that machine was nonUS military, for example in prisoner of war situations. Once removed are stories in other machines science fiction and corporate, but they always reference this military genre, and indeed the testosterone shots of action even reference their comic sibling.You can trace it, I think, perhaps starting in the comic, meaning Amrican, sections of The Great Escape, which immediately spawned TeeVee offspring in Gomer Pyle and Hogans Heros. Then a second wave triggered by Catch 22 and MASH, both of which had been real life, then books, then movies, and in the MASH case, then TeeVee.But before all that, there was the Phil Silvers Show, about a Sergeant Bilko and this followed from Mister Roberts. A happy con man, who only committed harmless crimes, and then only as response to an overly crude system which attempted to limit his life. This was in the day when TeeVee shows mattered. You absorbed them instead of merely carrying them to work to chatter about. It was not particularly clever in any way, except in finding that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom. Its one large zone where Americans worked out how they think about forgivable, even endearing lies in a military context, a zone that has been appropriated by one of our political parties here.Because its big, it sometimes pays off in laughs. Stripes was pretty darn funny I thought. It had the twist of the misfits actually defeating serious foes, sort of folding in some Dirty Dozen. And sexual adventure.Now this, well before the cultural wars escalated. It tries to touch that sweet spot, like other remakes that manhandled Steve Martin.

Although it is possible that the series, first titled You will NEVER GET RICH 195559 could have gotten on the CBS TV Network with someone else in the title role of Sgt. Bilko, it is very hard to picture any other ActorComedian in the business wearing those Master Sergeants stripes.Such a strong identification is inescapable, though not the same sort of careerwrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys, like Clayton MoreTHE LONE RANGER, George Reeves THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN and Charles Nelson Riley UNCLE CROCS BLOCK.One major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950s TV Screen to the 1990s Moviegoing public is our collective memory. Without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the Bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals, and their numbers were surely considerable; even a large segment of the young had seen Bilko reruns in recent times. It was obvious that the new film and the source were miles; or even light years apart.So as not to be thought of as a totally square, old grouch please let us consider some other points.Right here today, the 14th Day of November In The Year of Our Lord 2007, let me swear and affirm under Oath that I have been a Steve Martin fan for nearly 30 years, Furthermore, I have enjoyed the wit and talents of Bilko 96 CoStars Dan Akroyd and the Late Phil Hartman.

Our society today is filled with all types of sexual predators that pray upon children, yet film makers make these types of movies that do nothing but provoke this type of behavior. I noticed that on a previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked. This is a kid here, and someone is asking something like this? What is wrong with this picture?","label":0},{"index":2587,"txt":"Back in my days as an usher Private Lessons played at the 4plex I was working. It was a sleeper hit selling out Friday and Saturday nights for several weeks. I never got around to seeing it but saw that it was on cable this last weekend, so I decided to give it a shot. What I witnessed for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and one that made me terribly uncomfortable to watch.The basic story is a teenage boy lusts after his sexy maid Sylvia Kristel. She, too, seems to feel an attraction towards the boy but for more sinister reasons. So we get scenes of the boy watching her undress and her inviting him in to watch. And it goes from there.Eric Brown, as the teenage boy, has to be one of the worst actors I have ever seen. His scared reactions to every time Sylvia takes off a piece of clothing or when she touches him are horrible. I did not laugh a single time during this piece of junk.And let us not get started on the subplot of the maid and chauffeur planning to extort money from the kid. Let us just say it involves faking a death, burying a body.... I could go on and on but it gets more ridiculous.The sex scenes are the worst I have ever seen. Even though Eric Brown was older then he looked, the fact is he looks like a baby. It appears he has no idea how to kiss a woman if THAT was acting then maybe I should rethink my criticisms of Brown and it just came too close to bordering on child pornography to be erotic. I have never been so turned off by a sex scene even though Miss Kristel is quite beautiful with and without clothes.SPOILER WARNING I must make mention of the last scene. To me it is just plain sick but I can remember audiences cheering as the film freeze framed and dissolved into credits. Our hero returns to school and begins a flirtation with one of the female teachers. He asks her out for dinner and she gives him a look as if Tom Cruise has just asked her out. She nods affirmatively and he walks away, smiling at the camera in triumph. GIVE ME A BREAK! Yes I am sure teachers all over would just risk everything for a plain looking teenage kid.I will never understand the appeal this film had in 1982. Certainly it was more then the nudity because there were plenty of teen sex comedies with nudity that bombed at the box office. And to think that these same teenagers that cheered that movie 22 years ago are now working their way up corporate ladders and possibly helping to run this country. THAT is a scary thought.","label":0},{"index":2588,"txt":"It says that a girl named Susan Montford both wrote and directed this movie. No wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing. She made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium.The fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs, is the blatant and complete lack of LOGIC.After she leaves the mall, she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her. Tell me, what woman would aggressively SHOVE a potential attacker while being surrounded, and insult them verbally? I do not mean after an attack had already started, because then of course it is completely normal for someone to fight back. But she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level. No woman would do that unless she 1 had a weapon, 2 has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close, and so is relatively safe from harm, or 3 the attackers are so young, and weak looking that she is pretty sure she can take them. None of that applied in this situation, so she was just acting like someone that is asking to get raped or mugged. And by the way, when the security guard approached, as SOON as he came within viewing distance of Kim Basinger, why would not she immediately either run towards him for help, or scream?? When she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head, she drives into a deserted part of town, and crashes. She had a good three minute lead on the pursuers, instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing, she gets out her Red Toolbox and starts messing around under her hood. I understand she was trying to fix her car, but she should have ran.I did not even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie, because I loathe people who do that in their reviews, but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that I have to comment on it.Why would she carry a loud, Red Toolbox as she is trying to sneak away in the dark? When she does get caught, one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox. First she resists, then eventually opens it. And takes out a wrench. This scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect I have to break it down, it is one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie. When asked to open the box, she is resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she did not open it, in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touchpushopenmanipulate, and once that hero refuses to open it, the enemy grabs that device, only to have that device automatically dispense a chemicalshoot him in the facerender him unconscious, which was the heros plan all along. It feels like that is what they tried to do with Kim Basinger here, as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a WRENCH and dispatches one of the thugs, and somehow GETS AWAY from him and the three other thugs.Throughout the rest of the movie, basically what you see is this suburban house wife, sneaking around the woods as she carries her Red Toolbox, taking out various tools used as weapons to KILL HER ATTACKERS.When she was running away, how did she end up moving BACK to where the thugs were? I think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude. She somehow crept up on them when I thought she was moving AWAY from them.Finally, this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason she is being chased in the first place is because from the thugs perspective, she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier, and so they felt they had to kill her. How ridiculous. As one of the thugs even said, they could have just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from, no one but her had seen them anyway, and she probably did not get the license plate. Even if these possibilities would not work in their favor, how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder?","label":0},{"index":2589,"txt":"Let us put political correctness aside and just look at this in terms of the numerous sex comedies that came out in the 1980s because I for one do not think this is any better or any worse than the others. Unless your some religious kook or an uptight female you can probably view a silly film such as this without getting all worked up about the content and I personally had a totally innocuous feeling towards this before and after watching it. Story is set in Albuquerque, New Mexico where a rich 15 year old boy named Phillip Philly Fillmore Eric Brown is naturally horny as hell and starts spying on the attractive maid that has just started working for his father.SPOILER ALERT Nicole Mallow Sylvia Kristel is friendly to Philly but things heat up when his father goes out of town on business and she starts to flirt with him to the point where she invites him into her bedroom to watch her undress. Philly is awkward and does not know how to react at first but soon he goes for it and has sex but than to his horror it seems that Nicole has died from a heart attack! With the help from the sleazy chauffeur Lester Lewis Howard Hesseman they seemingly have buried her body but a note from a blackmailer shows up and Philly must get 10,000 out of his fathers safe. Philly is shocked when Nicole shows up and he learns that the whole thing was an extortion plan set up by Lester and that she only went along with it because she is an illegal alien and if she did not do what she was told Lester would have called the immigration office. Together they try to get his fathers money back before he returns home and they enlist the help from Jack Ed Begley Jr. who is a tennis instructor but pretends to be a cop to scare Lester.This little comedy was made for less than 3 million but it grossed over 50 million worldwide and made it one of the least likely films during that time to be so successful which prompts me to wonder why this was a hit and not any of the others in the genre. Director Alan Myerson can boast that he made a hit film but the truth is that he never really had a career in films although he did go on to be very successful in television. So...why did this become so successful? I have a thought that it just may be because of Kristel and before you decide that I am crazy listen to my reasoning. Kristel was an international star because of her soft core films so that reason alone made many free thinking adults curious about viewing her in an American film that was getting a wide release. With that, the same adults would also be nostalgic about their own youth and the fantasy of being taught the ways of lovemaking by an attractive older woman which brings in the much younger audience members who are probably still very inexperienced and curious about the film. Anyway, that is my thought and if anyone has another reason I would love to hear it but back to the film itself it is apparent and very sad that a film like this could probably never get made again except in Europe because of the religious right and the other prudish freaks who just cannot come to terms with the fact that a teenage boy getting laid will not do him any harm. In fact, it is a valuable service that ALL BOYS pray will happen to them! The film itself is clumsy and Kristels body double is all too evident in certain scenes especially if you take careful note of the difference in their nipples. The story although intriguing in it is basic form is neither very funny or revealing so were left ogling the nude scenes that are really the norm for the genre.","label":0},{"index":2590,"txt":"One of the those coming of age films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids. This movie has neither. It is a poor excuse to let Sylvia Kristels body double frolic with a dorky Eric Brown. To make matters worse, the movie is either silly or stupid when it tries to be funny, sexy, or dramatic. Laugh awkwardly as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone with burying a dead woman in his front yard. Ponder vigorously on why a woman famous for Emmanuelle needs a body double. As the movie went on and on, I started to imagine a hybrid of Private Lessons and Little Miss Millions that had Sylvia Kristel seduce Jennifer Love Hewitt as Howard Hesseman makes us nostalgic for WKRP. Watch this to laugh at other peoples stupidity, or for Ed Begley Jr.s committed performance, or to wonder what Sylvia Kristel would look like with Jennifer Love Hewitt.

There are some adorable little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the film, like a little guillotine for hardboiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are being used to put in cream and sugar at the breakfast table. The wholesome of the film, however, is not as successful as it could and should have been, with jokes and parody situations that are way too overlong. The Roger Corman production Transylvania Twist, which came out four years after this, is a lot funnier and much more recommended. The film is particularly parodying the classic Universal milestones of the early 30s, so you better make sure you have seen those if you want to grasp all the tiny gags and references. There is a pretty original twist indicating that the Frankenstein character only behaves like a madraving evil scientist when he enters his laboratory. It is also revealed that he is actually more of a Father Damien sort of messiah who is only concerned with the condition of exiled monsters.

However, 712 decades later, it is being billed as a Three Stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today. Film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful Edna May Oliver as well as Zazu Pitts.As for the Stooges, this is a film from there very early daysbefore MGM had any idea what to do with the team. At this point, they were known as Ted Healy and his Stooges as Healy was the front man. Fortunately for the Stooges, they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man read up on himyou will see what I mean and the rest is history. Within a year, they were making very successful shorts for Columbia and executives at MGM were soon kicking themselves for losing the team. This sort of thing was a common occurrence at MGM, a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy such as the films of Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello and others. In fact, up until they left for Columbia, MGM put them in a wide variety of odd film rolesincluding acting with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in DANCING LADY. And, oddly, in this film they did not act as a teamthey just did various supporting roles, such as Larry playing the piano!This particular film begins with Pearl and Durante lost in the African jungle. When they are rescued and brought home, all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety showpunctuated by scenes with the leads here and there. As for Pearl, I could really see why he never made a successful transition to films, as he has the personality of a slug but slightly less welcome. As for Durante, I never knew what the public saw in himas least as far as his films are concernedhe was loud and...loud! He apparently took time off from helping MGM to ruin Buster Keatons career to make this film. Together, Pearl and Durante rely on lots of verbal humor? and Vaudevillestyle routines that tend to fall rather flat.In this film, the Stooges they did not yet have the right chemistry. Seeing Healy doing the job that Moe did in their later films is odd. What they did in the film was pretty good, but because all the segments were short, they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines. Stooges fans might be very frustrated at this, though diehard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their lifelong goal of seeing everything Stoogeeven the rotten Joe DeRita and Joe Besser films oh, and did they got bad after the deaths of Shemp and Curly.Overall, the film is rather dull and disappointing. However, there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess. At about the 13 minute mark, you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing. Look carefully, as this is Walter Brennan in a role you would certainly never expect! Another unusual thing to look for in the film is the Clean as a Whistle song starting at about 22 minutes into the film. This song and dance number is clearly an example of a socalled PreCode scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 when the Production Code was strengthened. Despite the word Clean in the title, it is a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of fleshenough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything! It is quite shocking when seen today, though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s. Finally, at the 63 minute mark, see Jimmy Durante set race relations back a few decades.

What did surprise me however was that the storyline was fairly drastically changed compared to the 1968 flick. Initially this awoke my interest, but what eventually surprised was that the new twists and turns a were apparently invented in order to present us with a typical Hollywoodlike product and b made the whole storyline improbable! The 1968 story was breathtakingly straightforward, and included no timestorms or any bogus of that sort it just stated that when you come home after a long journey, things might have changed a bit. Earth might have fallen in the hands of apes, for example. Like many old movies, it is main ingredient was suspense hell, does anyone understand that word these days?. In this Burton movie, an attempt has been made to turn the whole thing into an action movie, but at what cost? Surely, the images are overwhelming, and a lot of time and money has been put into the design of a complete apeculture even apemusic!, but what is wrong?First, the suspension of disbelief is made very hard, because the apes have a lot of Hollywoodhuman traits. I refer especially to Ari and the slavetrader. These traits include emotional skills like irony, sarcasm, and an overtly displayed array of subtle emotions. It makes you forget that the apes are apes, which is essential.Second, the humans TALK. Of course, we can imagine that humans will never forget how to speak, but the fact that the apes had speech and the humans did not made the apehuman roleswitching very tangible and stressing in the 1968 version. The wound in the throat that Charlton Heston gets there is essential to his survival and his later regained speech essential to his uniqueness and the interest that Dr. Zira has in him so, no need for things like human rights activists or apehuman love in order to explain things.Third, the fact that they talk ads a great deal to the implausibility, but is a necessary twist in the new movie, since Capt. Davidson has to play the Hollywoodlet ussavethewholeworld andhaveagoodendingforeveryone andstillmakeittotheloungebar foracooldietcoke character. Oh my god, will they never learn? I new it from the start, when there was only one guy who got lost! They were in need of a hero! And then the script writers go on reasoning we need one guy... so, why would one guy get lost... because he tries to save an ape from an electromagnetic storm... implausible! But it is necessary because it shows the audience that he respects apes! Since, in these modern and politically correct times, we cannot have a xenophobic apehater like Charlton Hestons 68 character loose on the screen let us give them a bubblegum version!Fourth, okay, the general twist of the original discovering the truth of the 1968 film to the modern version he finds that his own mother ship crashed on the planet ages ago and that their labapes developed their society, where Heston simply discovered that just, somehow, the apes overtook the earth while he was away is nicely done. The second, battlepart comes as an anticlimax. That is because this movie has added the first two Planet Of The Apes movies in one plot. Nice try, but the chill you feel when Davidson and you discover that he is lost on the planet forever just washes out due to the uninteresting battlepart.Fifth the ending!!! For chrissakes, who came up with that?! a Davidson crashes TWICE with his escape pod, which seems an unsteerable object, while the chimp manages to simply land gracefully? Come on, whod believe that? If the pods are really small space crafts Davidson simply flies off into space at the end and not merely escape vessels, he might have managed a safe landing at least once, no? And what about that ending???? I mean, in the original film it was clear that everything took place on earth. But here the whole movie takes place on a distant planet, and suddenly the same there is a Thade statue ape culture is on earth??? How come? Did the apes of the far planet evolve technologically, flew into the time storm and colonised earth before Davidsons mission took off? Why is Thade worshiped? Stupid stupid stupid.Helena Bonham Carter is even adorable and beautiful as an ape, but I would expected no less. I preferred her ape above Estella Warren as a human, but maybe I got some loose wire in my head. Nevertheless, the only convincing apes were Tim Roth as Thade wonderful! and Aris household ape the exgeneral, but I forgot his name.Nonono, a lot of things could and should have been addedaltered to the 1968 pic, but not the plot, at least not in that way. It was simple and clear and needed no additional explaining. It was nicely tonguein cheek and caricatured. Do not stylize everything...","label":0},{"index":2611,"txt":"Hmmm...where to start?

Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed. In South Americas War of the Triple Alliance 1865, Paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 Chaco War against much larger Bolivia.No society, however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population. Only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight.

The film therefore becomes extremely boring and predictable.GI Jane fails where other action films succeed, mainly because films such as James Bond, Dirty Harry and various others are larger than life, yet never proclaim to be otherwise. They are escapism, and therefore entertaining.

The latter time was with this \u0085 um \u0085 effort. Loonatics Unleashed is not without merit, and might be considered a good product were it not that it is not up to Warner Brothers quality. WB cartoons are noted for their cheeky humor, appealing at least as much to adults as to children. These pedestrian superhero episodes, on the other hand, cannot fail to convince adults to pass them up.The premise of the series is that 6 ordinary individuals 2 bunnies, a Tasmanian devil, a duck, a roadrunner, and a coyote live on the cityplanet of Acmetropolis and acquire super powers when a meteor strikes the planet in 2772. What is confusing is that the titles section features these individuals with a countup to 2772 from the 21st Century. Cute, but frelling stupid.In each episode, the super sextet \u0096 amid mildly amusing but essentially banal banter \u0096 fight various super villains. For the most part, these are types that appear in every mediocre superhero adventure series and even some of the better ones. Like many mediocre superhero series, this one takes its villains far too seriously for the context. And of course these guys are the only characters that laugh \u0096 the usual evil laugh, of course. Why is it that villains in predictable superhero adventures always \u0096 ALWAYS \u0096 laugh evilly at every opportunity? Animated material of this sort seems to leave laughter exclusively in the province of villains and occasionally their henchpeople andor henchthings.In point of fact, the makers of this series missed their best bets right from the getgo. The superpowers of the characters are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities, but sometimes not. The problem here is that we do not see enough WB looniness. Lexi and Ace have fairly ordinary biologically generated energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits one could describe as Bugslike. What we have here is basically the silly and drekish Teen Titans, including its overly modern animation look, but with animals. Feh.The other misstep by the programs creators is or are the villains. As noted before, these are not terribly imaginative and do the evillaugh bit excessively. Amazingly, the writers totally missed the obvious technique of making villains from stock WB characters as well as the protagonists. Adding to the fun could have been, say, Jupiter Sam \u0096 as well as The Fudd, still hunting wabbits \u0096 as well as Tech E. Coyote converted into a really neurotic villain \u0096 and so on. Ah, the sadness of missed opportunities\u0085.Sadly, this whole production has gone into too much overtime that is, a 2nd season.

Ideal for biting satire! Only, this movie completely blows its chance. The satire comes out only in a few scenes and performances of absurdity, but this satire is not sustained; it is neither sharp nor witty.

The comedy, I assume, is supposed to be in the absurdity of the situations, but the situations are largely uncomfortable and overserious, rather than evoking either laughter or thought.The script is rife with grave errors in disposition. The action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing, but instead oodles of time are spent on a young woman who was the one that wrote the new laws for fun, and who is trying to save everybody, by organizing a resistance that ships people to Africa. All this is beside the point! A movie like this should not pretend to be so serious! It is a satire! A political statement.

Neither one of the Hemingway women can act here although Mariel HAS improved over the years, Anne Bancroft offers the only touch of class as a prosecuting attorney, and Chris Sarandon is by turns pathetic and unintentionally hilarious as the smirking, smarmy bad guy of the piece.Veteran director Lamont Johnson cannot make a silk purse out of this sows ear of a script, which is stuffed to bursting with howlingly bad dialogue and outlandish situations. For example, the final sequence, where Margaux grabs her shotgun and chases Sarandon down after his latest shocking act is meant to be exciting but elicits hearty chuckles instead.

What it is is a badly written and for the most part badly acted drama. It purports to be sympathetic to the victim of the rape but shoves the scene in our face. To be totally honest however, Hemingways acting is so bad in that sequence that it loses any real impact it might have had. The trial scenes were boring and predictable. And the movie just went too far when 15 year old Mariel is raped thankfully that was not shown. I do admit though that it did lead to a great ending when Margaux grabs a gun and shoots Sarandon dead. But seriouslyhaving a young girl raped is just revolting.Acting does not help. For instance, Margaux was no actress. She was certainly a beautiful woman and an actual model I believe but her acting left a lot to be desired. It lessens the film. Mariel was just OK but this was one of her first films. Sarandon does what he can as the rapist. He was not bad but the terrible script worked against him.I do remember hearing that at a screening of this back in 1976 some women stood up and cheered when Sarandon was killed so maybe this works for some people.

I was surprised that it was more believable and well acted than I remembered, but one thing really stood out.

Is he completely psychotic or an average sociopath? How did he expect to get away with his attack on the younger sister? Is this character at all credible, or is it just a matter of more background being necessary? He seems almost simultaneously to be an uncomfortably believable character, and too crazy to actually be able to hold on to a teaching job that puts him in contact with young, vulnerable girls. This seems to to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general. It has nothing to do with his performance, which is terrifyingly convincing.The movie occupies an uneasy position between sheer exploitation and a half way serious treatment of the subject, without quite settling into either mode.

Soderbergh remakes Robert Siodmaks decent noir CrissCross faithfully, not altering the plot very much at all, however the adaptation drains it of every ounce of its stateoftheart film noir atmosphere, giving it the same story set in the very least appealing places, lifestyles and anachronisms. Soderbergh, who would later make wonderful crime films like Out of Sight and the Oceans series with great style and atmosphere, takes the dangerously obvious route to modernization by renovating the story with the ugliest, dullest and flattest fashions of the early 1990s. Nightclubs have terrible, revoltingly dressed garage bands, Peter Gallaghers uninteresting version of Burt Lancasters antihero is left by his femme fatale girlfriend for compulsively buying cinematically lifeless modern appliances like stereos, TVs, and other up to date pieces of equipment that suck the reaction out of the film.It could have been more entertaining and less boring had it a few saving graces like a good score, more flesh to its characters, more than just William Fichtner giving performances that are not wooden, a crisper pace. Unfortunately, Underneath has none of these things. Soderbergh, a fine director, does not utilize his dry detachment to the benefit of his film this time. That disposition works wonderfully when he is helming a crime movie with more tongue in its cheek like the George Clooney pictures previously mentioned, or a social or character drama like Traffic or sex, lies and videotape.

Call me oldfashioned, but I think of movies as a means of communication, and communication is not complete if the audience does not know what the hell the director is talking about. The directors avowed purpose is to make a movie void of Hollywood conventions. Among those conventions, alas, is consistency of character and clarity of concept. The director himself realizes that audiences often do not understand points where he has purposely avoided a Hollywood clich\u00e9. However, he never seems to grasp the idea that clich\u00e9s exist for a reason. They are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly. It is fine to avoid them, but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea, not simply eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing premise, rich with potential. Two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of WWII. Soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them. Someone with less disdain for the Hollywood convention of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea. This film certainly is not it!

It is a shame The Child is not better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. We have the idea of a vengeful child, which worked so well in classic films such as The Bad Seed and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie. The plot is basically this young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge as you do. This is all well and good, except for the fact that it is boring! Nothing happens for most of the film, and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore; it is not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it. The film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish. There is really not much I can say about the film overall as there is not much to it. The Child is a dismal seventies horror flick and I certainly do not recommend it.","label":0},{"index":2680,"txt":"A little girl lives with her father and brother in the middle of the countryside. This little girl Rosalie has some psychotic tendencies as the movie opens with her feeding kittens to some kind of creatures in the cemetery, and she has recently lost her mother who went crazy but whilst alive enjoyed staying in the woods all night. The premise of the film has a new young lady coming to Rosalie to take care of her. She is introduced to the evil of the woods while driving and, imagine the suspense here, experiences a huge blue barrel falling over the side of a cliff to somehow stop her car dead in its tracks. From there she walks to the nearest house and discovers Mrs. Whitfield who then goes into a whole lot of explanation about Rosalie and her family. The earnestness exuded by the Mrs. Whitfield character has to be seen to be believed. Well, the young lady meets up with the child and we soon learn that not only is she strange but everyone in the film is very bizarre as well. They all do share one thing in common which is none of them ever heard of an acting school. None of these people can act  as evidenced by the few vehicles any of them in the entire film appeared in before or since  and all of them look like they have little idea what is going on, pause to remember lines, and have all the conviction of a paper bag. The director plods through the material in a slow pace with this horrible piano music crescendoing here and there at things that are suppose to be scary. It takes us a bit before we get to a couple of murders by the creature friends, but by that time I did not care. The murders are not convincing either, and truth be told the whole film looks like someone through it together on their friends farm with the people and things on hand there. That all being said the ending does have some creepy aspects to it though we do not learn one darn thing about why Rosalie is like this or more importantly who the creature with the cheap masks are. Cheap does not even begin to describe the budget here with. It basically is a couple old farmhouses and some sheds at the end and of course the woods. Someone lent the director a couple old cars too. No special effects of any kind and only the most minimal makeup. There are so many guffawsridiculous moments to list, but I will just list a few here that at the very least made me chuckle from the lack of aptitude from the creative powers involved 1Watch the gardeners body well after he has been slain. Len comes in and sees him butchered and you can see his fat belly heave with life. 2the dying scene at the end where the actress playing Rosalie is killed. She looks like she is listening to directions and takes her sweet time dying considering the method. 3How about the guy playing Roaslies father giving us a cranky poor mans Andy Griffith. The scene where he is laughing about boy scouts dying was a weird hoot. The Child is indeed a very bad film and is very bad even for the standards of 70s cheese if you will. This is not a B film but more like a Z film with producer Harry Novak making some money on virtually nothing.","label":0},{"index":2681,"txt":"I am not going to say that this movie is horrible, because I have seen worse, but it is not even halfway decent. The plot is very confusing. I could not really figure out what was happening and where things were going. When the movie was over, I was left scratching my head. I watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up, but once the credits were over, that was it. I felt like I was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie, with little or no transition between the two. Character development is very shallow. I could not figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone. I could not tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk, stoned, mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them. This film seems to be based around stereotypes to it is credit, they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band, which SHOULD make character development easier, since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child, or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean. Stereotypes are easy to depict, which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters. This film, on the other hand, uses stereotypical characters left and right, but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible.Another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation. I guess that is OK because so little time was spent developing the characters that I really did not get a chance to know any of them, so I never really missed any of them.And last but not least was Sadies singing. It is awful. The music backing her up is not prize winner, but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from Sadies vocal cords. I swear that there is one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes. I seriously thought I was going to have to turn it off during this howlathon.As a whole, this movie is confusing. Characters are illdeveloped, Georgias acting is wooden and stiff, Sadies character is yanked from one bad situation to another, with no back story or explanation. The music was unbearable, and I can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain.","label":0},{"index":2682,"txt":"Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings, but only Winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role. Leigh, playing barband singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood, constantly leans on older sis Georgia, an acclaimed folk singer in the Joni Mitchell mold. Perhaps due to her double duties as coproducer on the film, Leigh seems to have boxed herself into a corner she is not credible as a singer and, even if this is intentional, gives herself far too much screentime at the microphone. Probably hoping for a tourdeforce, Leigh is wiredrawn and nervous and jagged; however, we simply do not see any talent within this character Leigh is obviously a solid actress, but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her. If Sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal, we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the small breaks that she does. As it is, the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim.

As for the stereotyping of the kibbutz as it was 50 yrs ago, well I was there and it just was not like that. OK every kibbutz had just a small piece of something shown in the film like youngsters raiding the kitchen at night but you cannot show the whole kibbutz as being full of all those  shall we say  naughty traits. Each kibbutz had its own problems, but hardly any kibbutz had all of them. The views of Israel were great. I still remember my youth in that Garden of Eden called the Emek valley.

In the first two minutes of the movie, the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves. And it is all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical kibbutznikim. Besides the two main characters, a clinically depressed woman and her young son, every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of well\u0085evil. The story centers on how the kibbutz, like some sort of cult, slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows. There is no happiness, no joy, no laughter in this kibbutz. Every charactersituation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny, hypocrisy, violence, cultism, repression etc. For example, while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome European looking 12 year old boy \u0096 his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and brutish personality. He cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother. He treats these volunteers like trash. After his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he has not seen in a long time due to his military service, he orders, Quote \u0096 Linda, go take shower and I cum in two minutes. There is one other good character in this movie \u0096 a European foreigner who plays the mothers boyfriend. When the animal rapist tries to hit the mothers son, the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapists arm. He is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for violent behavior against one of the kibbutz members. More hypocrisy The indescribably annoying French woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18, or without love and gives an account of the actual act that is supposed to be humorous for the audience, but is really just stupid. She of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boys mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse. The film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult. Children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders. The mother apparently cannot escape the kibbutz, although in reality, anyone wasis always free to come and go as they choose. It is a mystery how the boys father died, but you can rest assured, the kibbutz drove him to it and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless, wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son. That is the gist of this movie. One dimensional characters, over dramatization, dry performances, and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audiences head \u0096 that kibbutz life was degrading, miserable and even deadly for those who did not fit in. I feel sorry for the guy who made this film \u0096 obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz. But I feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs.","label":0},{"index":2688,"txt":"This is the worst movie I have seen for years!

This movie was a disaster waiting to happen, and it is an embarrassment to Hollywood.The movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality. For example, this kids remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood, and even enters this house. It is even covered with clothes. Is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances? Hollywood obviously did not believe so. Common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite; I doubt the race car could even have reached the street, let alone a house across the street. Another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess. Why is it in all these movies, these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eightyear old? The kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? Please, there is more reality in The Matrix. Also, the leader puts down his real pistol and accidentally picks up a plastic pistol; apparently, he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove on, one should be able to do that. Just because they look the same does not mean anything; there is other senses then sight. The traps are unrealistic as well; if any one of them actually worked, the criminals would be dead.

This one tries to be original, and succeeds to some degree... of course, the formula is basically the same, so it is like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot. The new score is quite badthough the new setting traps piece was, if nothing else, interesting and different, especially compared to the grand score of the first, and the almostbutnotquiteasgood score of the second. It almost makes up for it by using some pretty good nonoriginal music, but it is just not the same. The plot is fair, and somewhat original to the franchise, but it is still basically the same movie as the first two, with worse acting and a less impressive example of the scary character turning out to be good. The acting is mostly unimpressive. The characters are mostly caricatures. The new thieves are less entertaining than the old onesand they make fun of spystuff, which is almost criminal, given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are, and how precious few of them are cool. The fact that there are more of themand thereby more traps is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films... and it does not work. The idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too... adult and serious for a childrens filmand there was a sexual joke or two, though that is not the first time in the series. It is also unnecessarily complex, as is the plot in general. I could follow it, but I doubt a kid could. Some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid. The animal stuff is generally not amusing. There are fewer siblings, which should mean that those there are get developed more, but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films. All in all, just not particularly good, or worth watching, unless you really love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoony violence.

The slapstick humour is consistent as well, but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film. No pun intended. This film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did, and there really is not the warm, holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had. It is more of a pure comedy, but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me. I would not recommend this film; it is pretty boring.

The pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks, and you would have to be blind to think those chicken pox are real.

Enter Antoinette Lilly Sandra Locke \u0096 Eastwoods girlfriend at the time.

It is hard to say. There is the romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly, but the problem is that for the first half of the movie she is so haughtily insipid and detestable that when she suddenly becomes one of the troupe halfway through the film, it is not only unbelievable, but the audience is well past caring about her. There is the chronic lack of funds behind the Wild West show, but this topic is not touched upon enough to really be the raison detre of the film. There is Miss Lillys predicament of being stranded in the rural west, cut off from the funds that fuel her spoiled life of luxury she is mistakenly believed to be dead by her family and the press. But are we really supposed to believe that she could not get back to New York and her waiting fortune if she gave it a bit of effort?No, the point of this film seems to be that Billy is the leader of a family, a lovable bunch of losers who hang together through thick and thin. This is a warm, fuzzy film \u0096 or at least tries to be. Along the way, Clint shows us his skills with a gun, even foiling a bank robbery in a shooting that is grotesquely out of place in an otherwise relatively nonviolent film. One of the gang is arrested on an old draft evasion charge; Billy bribes the local sheriff. The show is tent burns down; an orphanage makes them a new one. But numerous mundane pitfalls do not a plot make.Compounding the problem is the acting, or lack thereof. Aside from Scatman Crothers, the supporting cast is quite amateurish.

But I think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip; the evidence is there in the films. In Sleepy Hollow, he could not decide what kind of movie he was making, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of british character actors Chris Lee, etc. made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film those are never scary, as horror fans know. The movie could not succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic, and no style had been developed to smooth the two together.

What does make for great viewing is total clarity, precision, plots and storylines  and characterisations  which have a beginning, a middle, and an end.This kind of cinematic presentation  akin to the Dim Sum experience in a Chinese restaurant  is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme.Thank goodness, then, for the TV and DVD presentations of the Hollywood and British film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers, director, and actors knew the value of clear story telling, diction, and acting that meant something.This is one DVD that this family will not be sitting through again.","label":0},{"index":2735,"txt":"I saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources.

I suppose it is one of those films that is intensely intelligent...so intelligent that I think you need to be well versed in the oil industry and a politically brilliant mind. I do not consider myself unintelligent, I have been studying politics since my early teens and I enjoy an intelligent film but for the most part unless it is a documentary films are meant to be primarily entertaining as well as have a message. Syriana tried to be strictly intelligent and it does turn some people away. I would even go so far as to say that those who rave about it and insist it is a 1010 are lying because they think they look better. This film was the most confusing, senseless, mindless dribble I have seen in awhile...Especially considering the critical acclaim, the Oscar nods, and the cast. Screenplay writer Stephen Gaghan has disappointed me yet again. His horribly written Havoc preceded this film and I think he is just trying way too hard. I cannot believe he was offered the opportunity to write the Da Vinci Code screenplay. On top of that Gaghan directed the film which made it an absolute mess. I had no idea who anyone was, why things were happening, who was who and what was what. It was a disaster.Because I do not really know who anyone was I can only mention the actors and what I thought of their performances because despite the horrendously complicated script the actors did alright. George Clooney plays C.I.A. field agent and assassin I think?? Bob Barnes. Clooney has never been a favorite of mine but lately he is managed to churn out some decent performances and this seemed to be a pretty good performance on his part. Barnes was a complex character with a sordid history and if I knew what was going on with him I would have really enjoyed his character. Matt Damon plays Bryan Woodman and he is rather bland and always looks like a deer in the headlights which I can understand his confusion after reading this script and then trying to perform it. Amanda Peet plays his wife and she does well in the few scenes she is given. Christopher Plummer makes a cameo appearance as someone doing something. I like Plummer and love seeing him show up even if he does not get top billing anymore.The cast is intense if only the story made sense. I would like to exact quote the description of plot on IMDb. A missile disappears in Iran, but the CIA has other problems the heir to an Emirate gives an oil contract to China, cutting out a US company that promptly fires its immigrant workers and merges with a small firm that has landed a Kazakhstani oil contract. The Department of Justice suspects bribery, and the oil companys law firm finds a scapegoat. The CIA also needs one when its plot to kill the Emirapparent fails. Agent Bob Barnes, the fall guy, sorts out the double cross. An American economist parlays the death of his son into a contract to advise the sheik the CIA wants dead. The jobless Pakistanis join a fundamentalist group. All roads start and end in the oil fields. WHAT!?!? Say who now?? Syriana might be the thinking mans movie but it bored me to tears and no matter how hard I tried to stay with it I eventually surrendered and turned it off after an hour and a half and you could not have bribed me enough to get me to finish it.

Munkar is bald guy with half a spiders web tattooed on his skull and an impressive harem that would even make the wealthiest oil sheik jealous. Okay, granted, Deathstalker is a pretty damn awful and at some times even unendurable movie. The fight sequences are lame and the costumes and makeup effects are downright pitiable. For a moment, when beholding the opening sequence, I actually feared I was watching Troll; the Prequel. The monsters look incredibly cheesy and the complete opposite as menacing, but it is undeniable entertainment if you are in an undemanding mood. I presume this is not a favorite amongst feminists, as the overall portrayal of women is somewhat \u0085um\u0085discriminating. Most of the gals exclusively serve as eyecandy in the harem.

The acting is terrible, the plot is pure crap, and the effects and photography could not be more amateurish. But it is the bad acting, the cheesy effects, and the many errors, that makes this movie so hilarious. SPOILERS AHEAD Deathstalker Rick Hill is an extremely strong and skilled warrior. One day, a good witch tasks him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation, a sword, an amulet and a chalice, in order to free the country from its brutal ruler, the evil king and sorcerer Munkar. Obtaining the sword is quite easy, but the amulet and the chalice are in Munkars possession. Fortunately, the evil king has arranged a tournament in which the countys most skilled warriors fight each other until death. The winner is then to take the kings place. Of course, the king does not want anybody to take his place, an therefore he has planned to kill the winner instead of just not arranging the tournament in the first place. Deathstalker is not only to obtain the the three powers of creation, but also to save the old, good kings gorgeous daughter Barbi Benton from the claws of evil Munkar. Luckily, he does not get bored on his way to the tournament, since he is allowed hump the gorgeous female warrior Kaira Lana Clarkson in the meantime...The film has many great, incredibly stupid and funny scenes. Some of my favorite scenes include  Deathstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword. The head that falls down, however, is not that guys head. The falling head has a red goatee, while the guy beheaded by Deathstalker had dark hair and no beard. When the character of female warrior Kaira Lana Clarkson is introduced, she is first seen in a black robe, hiding her face and body. Deathstalkers traveling companion Oghris Richard Brooker fights her, and during the sword fight her robe under which she is, of course topless opens, exposing her breasts. Her breasts are the first thing we see of Lana Clarkson, even before her face. The last warrior Deathstalker has to fight in the tournament, is a giant guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig. Evil Munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a chest. He feeds that little creature human eyeballs and fingers.... There are many other unintentionally funny, hilarious, and great scenes. The acting is terrible but Barbi Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are eyecandy, and although I described this movie as unintentionally funny, I sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crappy the movie is.

The plot follows as Deathstalker Hill tries to get something back from the evil lord, and he has to travel to the lords cave. He meets many dwarfs and monsters during his journey, and the settings are very close to Tolkien, and of course Conan the Barbarian. This is a rip off of huge success of Conan, and even though this is very stupid film, it has many nice trash merits and is recommended for trash fans and tolerating film junkies!There are no many cinematic merits in this film. Couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating, but what Deathstalker concentrates to show, are nude females and huge muscles of Hill. Females are usually helpless victims and very stupid, too, so this is very macho film and thus may not please many feminists! The fight scenes are nothing special and pretty dull, and the monsters are not either anything special. And all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly done, but what did you expect from low budget effort like this? This tries to be as great as Conan but fails pretty miserably.

Just when they are about to get down to it, this old dude appears, interrupting what could have been the end of a perfect day for Deathstalker and a possible perfect ending for a shortfilm.Now tell me\u0085 Is not that the point where either a feminist would angrily switch off the movie, or any other male viewer would say This is going to be one hell of a good movie! The plot is as simple as throwing a kitten from the balcony Deathstalker must obtain the Sword of Justice and use it to steal the Amulet of Life and the Chalice of Magic from the evil sorcerer Munkar.Aside from decapitations, dismemberment, random bloodshed, retarded fist fights and embarrassing sword fights, this film also contains a massive amount of t!ts  a shots. I initially wanted to add one extra point to this movie for each gratuitous shot of naked boobies I could count. After 9 points not even halfway into the movie, I had to give up counting.

And heres an interesting question What would you do if a man in a womans body would enter your bedroom and try to kill you with a knife? The answer is simple You slap him around a bit, take away the knife and then try to rape him. Then you discover that he is actually not a woman, so you throw him out of your bed and tell him to leave your room. It works out well, I tell you. Deathstalker does it too, and the Deathstalkerway, is the right way!DEATHSTALKER is a wonderful movie, really, as pointed out in other comments. The villains are vile. The women are delicious. There is blood, sex, violence, rape and tasty chicken. There is a completely pointless tournament which just features a bunch of barbarians beating, slashing and hacking the crap out of each other. My favorite weapon used in that tournament was a giant wooden hammer, used to beat a poor contender to bloody pulp. And my favorite contender undoubtedly was that one brute with the Warthoghead reminiscent of the Gamorrean Guards from RETURN OF THE JEDI. I will not reveal how the movie ends, but just prepare to ravish in delight when I tell you a 4way dismemberment is thrown into the movies climax.And of course, there is a wonderful display of ineptitude throughout the whole movie. See a guy being dragged behind a horse over a dirt road, and the next pointofview shot shows him being dragged over grass no road. See that awesome tattoo on the sorcerers head magically change sides within the same scene on shot has it on the left side of his head, the other on the right. Well, after all, Munkar is a magician. It is that, or this movie was shot in an alternate universe where things like continuity simply do not exist.As much as I enjoyed this and as much as I am looking forward to the other 3 installments in this series, I do have enough shreds of decency left in me to not let this movie pass. I am prepared, though, to give it the maximum amount of minimal points, just so I could be able to deduct a couple of more points for the possibly inferior sequels to follow.

Only Palette with his distinctive voice and over the top readings manges to elicit a few smiles. But, all in all, this was dull and laughlessa real chore to sit through. This gets two stars only for Cagney and Davis acting and some beautiful cinematography but reallyit is not worth seeing. Cagney and Davis hated this film in later years and you can see why.","label":0},{"index":2762,"txt":"This film was a big disappointment.I take the opposite view of the critics. This is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors; here the actors Bette Davis and James Cagney are simply not up to the level of the material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were every bit as big as Davis and Cagney, and look how It Happened One Night turned out  an alltime classic. With a very similar story, Davis proves that she has no talent for comedy good thing for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted! Davis onenote performance oozes petulance, but none of the nuances of Colberts acting in It Happened One Night. Cagney, who was a great comedy actor, just seems outofsync with his costar, Davis. The script provides some decent lines and gags, but the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy.Part of the problem is the soundtrack, which, like the delivery of Davis and Cagney, seems more suitable to a light drama than a comedy.Jack Carson, who played similar roles throughout his career, has more capably handled very similar material. In a fairly typical supporting role Eugene Palette delivers a respectable performance. In a slightly different role as an old west relic, Harry Davenport, is very good. But in one of his poorest performances, William Frawley is quite irritating. His characters constant references to fictional cops are a poor effort at irony. I really love every one of these performers, and it is a shame that, as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and no better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.","label":0},{"index":2763,"txt":"0.510. This movie has absolutely nothing good about it. The acting is among the worst I have ever seen, what is really amazing is that EVERYONE is awful, not just a few here and there, everyone. The direction is a joke, the low budget is hopelessly evident, the score is awful, I would not say the movie was edited, brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase. It combines serial killings, voodoo and tarot cards. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. It is not scary at all, the special effects are hopelessly lame. laughably bad throughout. The writing was appallingly bad. The cinematography is real cheap looking, and very grainy sometimes, and the camerawork is dreadful. Again, what really does the movie in is how badly all the actors are. Cheesy.","label":0},{"index":2764,"txt":"I was searching through Hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a goodlooking horror movie to watch over the New Years weekend. As I was looking through the shelves, Severed spotted my eye, and I grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent Bgrade horror movie. The cover looked fairly good. The plot sounded semiinteresting. So I rented it. What a mistake. Do not be fooled by the cover, which actually looks decent. I am thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself. The film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodooinspired, ritualistic serial killer called The Head Hunter, who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city probably Los Angeles, and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murder.Story sound somewhat good? Well, it is, and this movie could have been halfway decent. But good God, it was bad! Almost everything about it was laughable. The opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge, outdated cell phone, and for whatever reason, she goes outside and talks to some guy. Then, a shadow comes up behind them, hacks off his head, and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial 911. Sound ridiculous? Yep, you bet it is. The entire movie looks like it was filmed on a VHSquality camera, and I am assuming it was. The acting was mostly awful, and the special effects were far from believable. And the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful  the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someones bathroom. Everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious, and it did not hold my interest for very long, and I often found myself bored and tired, mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography. The pacing was bad. Everything was just bad.Overall, Severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent Bmovie. The plot was good and I think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget, it could have been alright. But this movie fell flat on it is face. If you are expecting something semidecent, you will be sorely disappointed. Only recommended if you can tolerate Dgrade horror flicks. Otherwise, you will probably want to stay away from this straighttovideo garbage. It had a little potential, but it was beyond a mess. 110.","label":0},{"index":2765,"txt":"This film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was sort of a remake but then again, not really. I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal. He had great make up and CGI available and lots of money 100 million but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than 6 million? Heck no. So in that regard, the film fails.At least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming. And, by the way, if you give it some thought, and I did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. I just wish I had back the time that I wasted thinking about it.This film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of Beneath the Planet of the Apes. Heres how I would have written itAn astronaut it really should have been more than Marky Mark because he is not good enough to care a film all by himself so I would have put in three guys that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans not mutes, a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they are on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it.But my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. Sadly, Tim Burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He is a rotten director inspite what of people think. He is trendy so he must be good goes the thinking. Sorry, but no.

He is been doing this for over a year I am not going back to get exact numbers  thank you VERY much, possibly two or three years. One head a week. And the police are JUST NOW calling in a specialist who ONCE refers to himself as a psychic, but that never comes up again.Schya right! Feds take over after, what, THREE connected homicides? After NEARLY A HUNDRED SIMILAR KILLINGS we would be under freaking martial law!!!!!Anyway, this specialist consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time, and the two of them come to the conclusion that it is Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit, who is cutting off heads to gain enough power to make himself a body and then presumably take over the world  or possibly just go to Disneyland.Um.Setting  where IS this happening? Well, if you are not from Seattle, you might not realize that at the barrave occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members, there is a poster for a local radio station, and that in the highlyentertaining, Pulp Fictionesqe dialog as IF between the two cops yes, the ones who get their heads cut off about 15 minutes into the flick they discuss the new stadium which may still have been an issue when this movie was made.Being from Seattle, I apologize on the movies behalf and hang my head in shame.OK, heres where it gets really critical  being a horror movie writer not published, do not go looking for my name in the IMDb, I do research. Lots of research. And unlike the writers of this movie, I know that Baron Samedi  while a Voudon Loa spirit who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated by various Christian oppressors with Satan  is actually a Lokilike trickster god. In other words, he does not cut off heads.Besides, a major part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants. Their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the loa.Not to mention, if he is already possessed someone, why make a NEW body?Also, if Baron Samedi GOT a body, he would not go around cutting off heads, he would get some good rum and cigars and parTAY!!!In summary, the only thing they did get surprisingly right is that in the completely unnecessary Tarot card reading used only to show that the voodoo chick is spooky they did not screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do. Again, I have done research. Anyone remember the old latenight ad for phonein tarot readings  The lovers  you will soon fall madly in love... and all that nonsense?If you made it this far through my comments, I congratulate you.

No big cattle empires there, they are much farther west in Texas, farther than Richard Dix and Preston Foster could ride to set up their empire.The film begins with the two of them partners in a riverboat and when Leo Carrillo tries a theft of their services by not paying them for hauling his cattle, they keep the cattle. And that is the beginning of the big Ponderosa like ranch they start.Along the way Foster marries Dixs sister played by Frances Gifford and feuds with his much smaller neighbors.

Is not the fundamental rule for science fictiondrama to create in the audience the willing suspension of disbelief. POA 2001 creates a plausible beginning, suckering us in, but thereinafter Mr. Burton forgets that his moviegoers have working brains. The over the top libertarian of Helena Bonham Carters chimp, the worthlessness of the humans lockup, the ease of their escape, their extraordinary skills of horsemanship this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly riding full tilt, the massive and immediate human rebellion all are too unbelievable. Mark Wahlberg never once projects any sense of real fear, danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down. Compare to the original, in which Chuck Hestons nakedness metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events. The uniformed Wahlberg preserves his modesty, but also his apparent sense of management and control in an inherently wacky situation, and we never really wonder about his well being. Unlike Heston, he seems never to be in real jeopardy. Tim Burton should have used some of the fx budget for some competent screenwriting. In fact, after this inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywoods producers ever bothered to settle the screenwriters and directors strike threats. Let them walk.

Specially when taken into consideration that this is a Tim Burton film. He is defenetly one of the most original and, might I say, cool directors Hollywood has produced.I am personally a great fan of his work, but something obviously went wrong with his latest flick, The Planet of the Apes. I really enjoyed the original film. When it first came out people expected just another cheezie 70s science fiction film, but a very surprise anding totally proved that theory wrong. It had indeed a clear cut message. An obvious antiwar message. Fear of the cold war, where it was taking the world and fear of the use of nuclear weapons played a big role in the mind of the filmmakers. Those reasons made the film rise above all expectations and it became a instant classic. Although, the new film, the remaking or whatever, leaves us with nothing. No message, no ideals behind it. It is just another moneyminded summer blockbuster.Visually Tim Burton does not let you down. The dark and creepy settings were excellent and of course the make up was terrific.Obviously that is not enough to keep people intrested in a film. There has to be an exciting plot or storyline. In this movie the plot is highly uninteresting and it is extremely badly thought out. The script is very lame and it is full of gaps. It looks like this film had been written in a big hurry. The explanation for why the apes where there, and why the ruled the planet was indeed very stupid and proved the scriptwriters ignorance.It raised a lot of questions, which had no reasonable answers to.For example; Why did the apes speak English?, why were there other apespecies than chimps on the planet given that there were only chimps in the space ship that crashlanded on the planet Where the hell did all of those humans come from? How were a few chimps able to evolve into a huge raise of all kinds of monkeys in only a few thousands years. I mean it took a few million years for us to evolve from monkey to man!And finally, the bad surprise ending was just plane dumb. It was probably just thrown in because the original film had such an end, then they felt that the audience were expecting the same kind of ending. The ending also raises a lot of questions, which I KNOW, don\u00b4t have intelligent answears. Did Theid learn to work the space ship?, which was powerless, and learnt to fly back in time and take over the earth single hand?, and, what did he do, breed with all the women? And lets say that that would happen, I higly doubt that history would stay the same, like Washington would be built exactly like it is today! I mean woulnt there be a huge banana instead of the memorial?Well, just to say something posative about the film. Some of the cast was great. Helen Bonham Carters character was interesting and wellacted, as for Tim Roth as Theid. He was very good, a little exaturated at some points of the film. Michael Clark Duncan was also fine. I was not happy with Marc Whalberg. He is not much of an actor, and plays here a very macho colourless character. Very unbielevable and is nothing compared to Hestons character in the original. And the main female character had no reason or place in the film. She was just casted for the looks.

He has done it with Batman, Sleepy Hollow and now this. This is not a remake. The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak and Charleton Heston makes a cameo. Burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for todays mass viewership.The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time. During the 1960s America was struggling to redefine its civilization. It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms. It was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal. In that context, POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day. POTA was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of American society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior. The dialectic between Colonel Taylor Charleton Heston, Dr. Cornelius Roddy McDowall and Dr. Zira Kim Hunter was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious.Burtons version is as much a product of todays times as POTA was of the sixties. This is Apes for Dummies. It is superficial and jejune, substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance. The surprise ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel. While the ending of the original POTA gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene, Burtons ending simply mocks the audience, taunting, I know something you do not know, and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.From a technical perspective, as is always the case with Burtons film, the film is excellent. The makeup is fantastic and Burtons camerawork is outstanding though I continue to dislike his dark look. However, thirtythree years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script.The story has been reduced to a monster movie. The humans band together behind Captain Davidson Mark Wahlberg to fight the monstrous Apes, aided and abetted by a few turncoats notably Helena Bonham Carter as Ari. The presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence, perfect for todays fast food mentality.The acting is mixed. Mark Wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role. Walberg is excellent at playing dark, sullen characters that are tormented but strong. This part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in Wahlbergs repertoire. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable. She tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character, but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager.Then there is Tim Roth. His is a virtuoso performance, singlehandedly saving the film from total ruin. Roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent General Thade. He creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys I can remember in some time. Additionally, his physical acting is superlative, rendering a chimpman that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists.This film is a great disappointment. It is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door. I rated it a 310. From a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a 910. However the story is an insult to the original franchise. It is simply another attempt by Burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is. Of course it is true, but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption.","label":0},{"index":2785,"txt":"If there is one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film, it is seeing it done by experienced filmmakers who ought to know better. This reimagining of Planet of the Apes could have used some imagination, to say nothing of essential elements of character development. Nova, the girl in the original Planet of the Apes, was a better developed character than Daena in this version, for all that she does not say a single word. One certainly expected a lot better from Tim Burton, a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence, wit and humour, all of which were notably absent from this production.There were problems in basic plot development. The first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk. This was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made all the difference in the original film. Even while he was mute, his ability to communicate was what marked out Hestons Taylor as being different from the other humans. In the current film, Mark Wahlberg encourages the talking human slaves to revolt, but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already. They are dexterous toolusers and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans, something mute humans cannot do. It needs no man to fall from the stars to save them. Indeed, since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pretechnology era without at first any gadgets to help him, it is Wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage, not the humans who are used to living there.It was sad to see Helena Bonham Carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall Mark Wahlberg. Her best scenes were with the villainous Tim Roth.The humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act, at which point Daena started showing some actual interest in Davidson Wahlberg, and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gungho freedomfighter. This was poor character development. Estella Warren, in particular, looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script. Wahlbergs puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me, as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout.Creating the apes half a plus point and two minuses Ape makeup was excellent on the males, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes which was why he was so good in The Green Mile, and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully. But the ape females looked like nothing on earth, neither ape nor human. The minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as Flash Gordons rocket jumping apes looked as if they would just been fired from a catapult, they had none of the longlimbed grace of genuine apes. Secondly, the poor sound mixing  when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal, probably feline, making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic.In the original film, the various human things the apes do and say are handled as light relief I never knew an ape I did not like. Human see, human do!. Here, the apes just talk matteroffactly exactly as 21st Century humans do, and there is no humour in it at all. The only genuinely original idea was Ari writing with her feet.Nothing made me cringe more than the VGer from Star Trek moment near the end of the film. First of all, the apes had apparently been able to read Roman lettering in the distant past, for them to know the name of the Forbidden Zone in its partly concealed form. Secondly, the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which Wahlberg just brushes away, something any ape could have done centuries ago. This moment was, for me, far worse than the muchmaligned ending of the movie.Things of that nature, however, are typical of most science fiction movies of today. Back in the 60s and 70s, they generally did not have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets, but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional. I am thinking of 2001 A Space Odyssey, the 1967 Planet of the Apes, THX1138, Soylent Green, Silent Running and the 1972 Solaris. The first Planet of the Apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time. However, this film includes just about every bad science fiction clich\u00e9 going space storms, anomalies and worm holes straight out of Star Trek; the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes in reality from any one planet, all other bodies, even their own moons, are just points of light; a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from Saturn to Earth in a matter of minutes instead of years; twothousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button. To say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door. In a contemporary setting, you would have to explain why it was bullet proof, but because it is science fiction you do not have to!Overall, Burtons most disappointing film.","label":0},{"index":2786,"txt":"Warning Spoilers Galore!Tim Burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking Psycho  oh, that is right, some idiot already did that  I rest my case.Movie opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation, proving he is not that smart from the outset. Marky Mark appears in shot without his characteristic underpants showing, then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzees.The perfunctory establishing shot of the space station orbiting Saturn for no apparent reason, interior of ship abustle with genetic experiments on apes. Must we travel 1,300 million kilometers to Saturn to conduct these experiments? The special effects team decrees it.Markys chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s scifi cinema  the Time Warp. Marky then demonstrates the space stations mindboggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing, while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deepspace rescue mission into a wormhole for an expendable test chimp, with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies.Before anyone can say Pointless Remake Marky has surfed the wormhole, crashed on an alien planet, removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest, if it were not for the kliegs backlighting the plastic trees.Surprise! It is APES doing the chasing  or at least, it would have been a surprise if no one saw Planet Of The Apes THIRTYTHREE YEARS AGO.Since Marky Mark did not get to show his pecs, take down his pants, or bust his lame whiteboy rap, he was characterless. Michael Clarke Duncans gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing his lack of character. Helena BonhamCarter aka irritating chimp activist, at a loss without a Shakespearean script, did a fine job of outdoing both Marky and Clarke as Most Cardboard Cutout. Paul Giamatti, the orangutan slave trader, secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz. Though I have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie, one review headline captured the essence of this Planet Of The Apes reimagining The Apes Of Roth. While everyone else minced about looking like extras from One Million Years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth, as Chimpanzee Thade, chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously. As entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic Thade was, his character lacked a behavioral arc Thade is mad when we first meet him... and he is pretty much at the same level of mad at films end. Nice twist.The original POTA 1968 featured a leading character, Charlton Hestons Taylor, who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets  yet as that film progressed, Taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankinds worth  as their sole champion! The original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation, not salvation when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he is forced to realize that his species had NOT prevailed. Is there anything that cerebral or ironic to Marky Marks Leo? Or Roths Thade? No, but there is lots of running.The slogans cry Take Back The Planet .but it is the APES planet. In this movie, humans and apes crashlanded here together, the humans having degenerated to cavepeople, allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor; the apes DESERVED to inherit the planet! Along comes Marky Mark, in true anthropocentric arrogance, taking it for granted that humans HAVE to be the apex predators, simply because they are there. Taking it back is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001, complaining, A planet where men evolved from APES??!! and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anuses.Heston was cast in the 1968 POTA because he had established his reputation as a maverick he WAS BenHur, Michelangelo, Moses! To cast him as the mute, dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audiences expectations how crazed must a world be where Our Man Charlton cannot command respect? Marky Mark has currently only established that he has tight underpants.Though Heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council, he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting. When Marky Mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans, it is like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor, who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him. Burton tries to elevate Marky to humanitys icon, but he comes off as a chittering deviant. In the original film, the apes deem Taylor a deviant, yet he was, to audience and apes alike, an icon of humanity. That irony again.It was apt that a man who elevated scenechewing to an acting technique  Heston  should play the father of this films primo scenechewer, Thaddeus Roth. As Roths apedad, Charlton utters his own immortal lines, turned against the HUMANS this time, Damn them! Damn them all to hell!The movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end. While Thaddeus is giving Marky an assbeating lesson, a pod descends from on high with Markys chimpnaut in it. Apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature, while Marky proves his own hebetude by muttering, Let us teach these monkeys about evolution. Firstly, they are not monkeys, you ape! Secondly, it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point, not evolution. And what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy, not evolution.Giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that Estella Warrens halfnekkid role was actually integral to the plot be still my pants..No matter that he was humankinds last underpanted hope; in the end, cop apes take Marky away to Plot Point Prison where he was last heard ululating, It is a madhouse! A MADHOUSE!!...","label":0},{"index":2787,"txt":"Thank you Hollywood. Yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap, shallow, effectheavy and redundant remake. The original Planet of the Apes was an intelligent and thoughtprovoking movie with a very clear message. It was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting. This movie, on the other hand, seems to have done away with pretty much ALL the dialogues. Instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie. Dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum, character interaction and development are nonexistent and most of the time it is extremely hard to figure out what is going on. Instead, we get a bunch of pointless action scenes, some marginally funny oneliners and some very hollow quasiintelligent conversations. The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The makeup of the apes is magnificent, and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too. However, this does not distract from the fact that Planet of the Apes 2001 is a very shallow and simplistic movie, filled with paperthin characters, stupid dialogue and a nearly nonexistent plot.

This concept has been abandoned for this movie and instead it features a totally dull story that besides is not very original or cleverly written. A shame it tried to be so much different from its predecessor really, for else this perhaps could had been a more fun movie to watch.Just like Robot Jox this is a Bmovie but with as a big difference that it is just not a very good one. Perhaps this also has to with the fact that Robot Jox got made during the 80s, when Bmovies still had a certain bit of charm and class over it, even though the movie got released in 1990. This really cannot be said about this movie. It is just lame, badly made, poor looking and not exciting enough. It also has an ending which leaves you thinking This is it?

Perhaps a good main villain would had been a good idea and some other stuff such as an actual point to the story, some action, or likable main characters.Seriously what were they thinking when they picked the actors for this movie. All of them are simply not likable in their roles and especially Don Michael Paul is annoying as the main character, who behaves as if he is Gods gift to woman and Mr. Perfect who can compete with anyone. Were not they even simply able to get the actors from the first movie?For such a futuristic movie, with a concept of having large battle droids in it, this movie surely is lacking with its action.

Numerous unimaginative plot contrivances keep the film going, like a driveby shooting, an abandoned baby left in the weeds, a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer, a guy flying through the night sky over the city, a kid at summer camp.And through all these events, the one constant is the generous helping of sociological insights imparted through the dialogue, as characters compare notes on their life experiences.

The series fails not because it is unfair to compare it to the book, but because the various plot lines and characters just do not coalesce to make a coherent, dramatic, mysterious andcompelling entertainment. It is dull and flat. If you want to make apossibly good Bleak House, you need to expend 20 hours of film in 10 two hour episodes.

What does she do? Shoot him? Set him on fire? No, too logical. In a completely improbably wrapup, this woman, who is only prior romantic involvement with Barclay was, save for the technicality of marriage, rape, suddenly decides midsentence literally that she does not hate him, she loves him. And they are going to live happily ever after. All of a sudden for no reason in the world, this early female role model of independence and authority is transformed into the usual helpless ankletwisting twit more commonly found in films of this era. Yeah, sure, steal everything in the world that belongs to me and I will fall in love with you. On what planet does that happen? I can only guess the reason I never heard of this film before I happened to catch it on Turner is that it was as lost on contemporary audiences as it is today.","label":0},{"index":2813,"txt":"Here is one of those movies spoiled by the studios insistence on a happy ending. Conflicts which have stretched out for years are settled in a few minutes. It would have been far more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity. The talented Barbara Stanwyck is undone by a sudden metamorphosis from independent and assertive woman to a compliant female of the kind she has put down all her life. Brent, as usual, is well over his head and then there is the ludicrous situation of Gig Young playing a character named Gig Young.

The acting was awful at best. Tim Roth did an OK job as did Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking.The plot line was good, but the execution was just poor. I am tired of seeing Scotland portrayed like this in the films. Braveheart was even worse though, which is this films only saving grace. But seriously, people did not speak like that in those days, why do all the actors have to have Glaswegian accents? Just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes. I notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the Americans, and to be honest I can see why they would like it, I know they have an infatuation for men in Kilts.

This movie was supposed to be about vengeance for crimes committed against a culture, but it ended up being a petty barbrawl. And there was only one of them who actually knew what a sword was; Tim Roths character and yes, he plays him well. Rob Roy was a weak hero with no knowledge of how to use a sword, and the way he won was a disgrace.

On the other hand, I wish more American Civil War movies were MERELY two hours long. Gone with the Wind, Gettysburg  that is about the length I have come to expect; although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted; and even Gettysburg lasted as long as it did because things HAPPENED in the course of it.By contrast Ang Lees film is bloated and uneventful. It actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours. That was not a compliment. It is really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation at the time it feels as though it will never end, afterwards it seems to have taken no time at all.The film gets off on the wrong foot, as Lee plays his interminable credits OVER the opening footage bad mistake in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe. The central two are Jake, the son of German immigrants who are staunch supporters of Lincoln, and Jack, an equally staunch Southerner whose values Jake shares. I had to reread that sentence to make sure I had not written Jack instead of Jake at some point or vice versa. The two go off to become bushwhackers  Southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they cannot even be bothered to join the official Southern army, which I presume they think is for sissies. I am afraid Lee lost me right there. It is easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes if we have some independent reason to like them, or feel as if we know them in some way, then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more. Not so here. We are not properly introduced to Jake for at least an hour; when we are, it becomes clear he is a gormless pimple of a man, who is not a confederate by choice so much as by habit  the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does, whose psychology is purely immitative. The people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way. I found myself cheering whenever the Northern cavalry appeared on the screen. I thought good  kill the rebels, end the damned war, let me go home.Aggravating this problem is the horrible, horrible dialogue. Everyone speaks in the same whining Southern accent. I have heard accents from all over the Englishspeaking world and this is the worst of them all. I do not care if Southerners really did talk like that, it is simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours. And believe me, we do listen to it for the full two hours Lees picture is a talky one, largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical, sayeverythingthreetimes, folksy drawl. It would help if they talked faster, but not much. Cannot these people find a more efficient language in which to communicate?In short the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life, who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech, who do not bathe often enough, to whom nothing of interest happens, despite their being involved in a war. Good points? Jewel was nice to look at, and so was the scenery. But I have complaints even here. The cinematography, nicely framed, looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake; and as for Jewel, we were teased with her body, but never actually allowed to gaze upon it, which I think is the least we were owed.","label":0},{"index":2819,"txt":"Long on action and stunt work, but so short on character delineation and development that it failed to hold our interest.

It seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and seized by governments in many countries. Given how socialistic Sweden eventually became, the radicalism of its politics, once controversial, appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later. And its sex scenes, at one time the subject of sensational obscenity trials, look pretty tame in a modern context. Nevertheless, the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remains marginally watchable as an early reliquary of 60s youth rebellion.

But aside from gratuitous violence there was not really much of a point to this movie. Perhaps it was a political statement? That war is really nothing much more than gratuitous violence? If that was the point it was done quite well, but I do not think that was the point. I think the producers really thought they were making a worthwhile movie here, but as far as I was concerned there was a complete lack of any plot.

I have watched a lot of really long movies, but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on.. basically because I just could not bring myself to care for any of the characters. I just kept thinking.. who cares??? I also found the acting to be rather dead pan and the dialogue strained. I understand that this was the 1800s and all, but most of the conversations just seemed rather unnatural. No one seemed to have any emotion throughout most of the film except during melodramatic events.The romance in the story did not seem to be supported by anything other than I am a guy and you are a girl, which I do not consider much of a romance, and yet I felt I was being steered to the belief that these people were in love. Oh well.. I guess it is the whole all this horror around us, we have each other to cling to type thing, or whatever. I was also hoping for some sort of dynamic between the two best friends who both initially seemed to have an interest in the girl but that was just sort of dropped. Maybe avoiding a cliche love triangle. I do not know.Oh well.. Daniel Holt was about the only character I really truly liked. And Sue Lee was all right. I did not exactly dislike Jake, but he seemed a bit too... spineless, I guess. Jack Bull I did not care for at all. And I am pretty sure you are supposed to hate just about everyone else, with the exception of the poor normal people who just get mowed down left and right. It was pretty graphic and had that whole the horrors of war thing down, but I have seen plenty of other movies with the same theme, done better.

Thought visually stunning like all of Ang Lees work each still frame seems worthy of a print, I was really disappointed by the films disjointed pace. It really was too long.The story is set in Civil War era Missouri, and is about a young man Roedel who joins the feral forces of the Bushwackers, sort of renegade Confederate sympathizers who conduct geurilla type fighting with the Jayhawkers, their Union counterparts. He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles played by Skeet Ulrich, join the group after Chiles father is shot pointblank and his home is burned, presumably by Jayhawkers. The story follows Roedels and Chiles raiding adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war, including former slave who fights for the Bushwhackers Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright, and a war widow played by Jewel.It seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point, it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped. For example, the agitation among Roedels group caused by former slave Holt participating in the confederate cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding propriety and protocol, and then dropped until later in the movie. A young villianbully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and directs much angst and violence against him, but, we never know why. Some of the characters never seem to surface; I think that is because the movie embraces too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of history.The historical detail was excellent. I loved looking at the housing, furniture, clothes, etc., and I thought the lead actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters, though they stumbled a bit with the dialog.

Even Harvey Keitel appears to be out of his element, and lacks his usual impeccable clarity, direction and intensity. To make matters worse, his characters name is Che, and we are only told directly, by the narrator well into the film that he is not that Che, just a guy named Che. The family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film, and once defined, the family is divided  the younger generation off to America. So clich\u00e9. Other reviews discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boys family; however the political stance of the director is murky at best, and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed. So they lost their property acquired by gambling profits  so what? Refusing to take a political stand, when making a movie about the Cuban revolution, is an odd and cowardly choice. Not to mention the movie was in English! Why are all these Cubans speaking English? No wonder they did not get permission to film in Cuba. And if family life is most important to look at here, it would be great if we could figure out who is who  we are introduced to them all in the beginning  a cheap way out of making the relationships clear throughout the film! The acting was mostly shallow, wooden, and unbelievable, timing was off all around. The special visual effects were confusing and distracting.

Like Jan Kounens Dobermann, it suffers mostly from poor editingor lack of it. It is as if the director was so in love with his work that instead of cutting the movie down to a pace that kept your attention, he added all of the footage he had shot together. There are maybe two cool scenes in the entire movie. One of them is SPOILER when Benkei is petrified and the camera starts spinning around him. That was coolbut okay, we got it! Move on please! The camera will not stop spinning around this guy! There is maybe one or two more cool scenes that I forgot about in this flood of mediocrity, but the last duel scene IS NOT ONE OF THEM! It may be because unlike in the earlier swordhandling scenes, Shanao is not maskedbut just because the director could not find a stuntman who somewhat resembled Asano Tadanobu does not give him the right to go ahead and make up 80 of the sword fight with extreme closeups of sword clashes! And all from the same angle, may I add. The director should learn from the American produced 1995 bullettrain ninja movie The Hunted! I personally saw the village raid scene as a tribute paid to the social activists of the previous generation who were confronted by the police in the violent demonstrations of their college years. The situation where innocence is oppressed by an authoritative and armed branch of the government unwilling to understand seems to be a message common in the Japanese media, due to the strong influence of socialists and communists who are a political minority. The movie versions of GTO and Salary Man Kintaro are two other recent examples END SPOILER I do not understand. I just do not understand why people who do not speak the language of the movie find praise worthy material in this. Maybe the worst was lost in the translation.The ending of the movieon which marketing played a lot, is a different interpretation of the legendary encounter between Shanao and Benkei. But that legend is not the most popular in Japanese folklore, and it is so detached from contemporary themes, that after 138 minutes of over played visual techniques, who cares how the director wants to reinterpret the story!? Director Sasaki Hirohisa of Crazy Lips said that there was an unpleasant trend among new Japanese directors to ignore Japanese audiences, and target their movies for foreign film festivalsin order to gain faster international fame.

Gojoe goes off the deep end in the other direction.First off, I hate movies that have other characters inform the audience what the main character is like instead of having the character develop over the course of the movie. You cannot decide whether you are a monk or a warrior says almost every character in Benkeis presence, yet this inner turmoil is barely conveyed within the character himself. Instead of character development, we get bloated, boring, gory battle scenes. Asanos character is undeveloped and even he looks like he is bored and does not know what he is doing there. I know that he usually looks distant and cool and that is part of Asanos appeal, but this movie does not serve him.A lot of the camera movement is nauseating. There is a scene that goes on forever in which the camera spins around the main characters until my wife and I felt like vomiting. The ending is ridiculous and rather anticlimatic.

Requiem For A Dream, Trainspotting, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Candy are just a few examples. Though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like Go overall, both serious and funny and Halfbaked.On a final note, the one possibly redeeming line in this movie, delivered by Vinnie Jones was stolen from Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels.

It was supposed to be simply titled, THE OGRE, which is how director Lamberto Bava had released it.An American family rents an Italian villa for the summer. The woman Virginia Bryant has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old winecellar of this villa an encountering this cocoonlike structure hanging down from the ceiling. It glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it. It drips what looks like green paint.Of course the husband does not believe any of this. The villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it.But then the OGRE itself appears in what looks like some kind of 16th Centaury costume with what looks like a wolfs head attached to it and it is attracted to the scent of orchids.The films is not really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring. There is no real gore other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool. The OGRE itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the familys Jeep Cherokee. The copy of the Shriek DVD I watched was defective, with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film, a flaw I hope Shriek has since corrected. Extras include a short interview with Lamberto Bava where he explains how this was not a sequel, etc..etc...along with some trailers to other Shriek DVD releases.

I guess I can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed. Call me ignorant for not knowing of Schneebaums book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that I have been living under some kind of a rock, but do not blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this documentary is actually a companion to said book. Yeah, I felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why I sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a Modern Cannibal Tale. I mean, am I a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes? I certainly did not expect an hour and fortyfive minutes of one old geezer kissing his own ass by whining about every little detail of his dull and worn out life. I certainly did not expect the insipid directing and I most notably did not foresee myself laughing so hard at Tobias Schneebaum and all of his offputting glory.Schneebaum is indeed unlikable. The old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of his even though he is not even that interesting a character to fill a story. Oh really? He was a cannibal? Ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding Schneebaums dirty past. The only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when Tobias finally breaks his little silent treatment about what happened to him in Peru and say that he had a small piece. That is it, folks. Ninety minutes of bull later and Tobias Schneebaum is a cannibal by three inches. It is like calling a movie The Life Of A True Don Juan only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when he once played just the tip. Unbelievable.The directing is, indeed, superbly ghastly as there is no flow or rhythm to the story that is being told. Alright, I understand that I did not read Schneebaums volume before watching his celluloid tale of it, but I can still recognize some bad pacing and even worse editing. One minute Schneebaum is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next he is going on and on about how he cannot drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative or some failed and miserable saga in his life. I mean, Jesus, can you at least slam his back story to the first part; follow up with some stuff covering his homosexuality and then end it off with a hearty look into his visit to Peru? Also I do not particularly care much for Schneebaums insipid little quips on life and living, but I at least implore the old man to keep consistent with his ramblings. If I hear a guy talking about how he prefers life in the jungle I do not expect him to suddenly bitch and moan about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later. Absurd.Another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which our hero has appeared. While some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story, the director has overused the gimmick and broken his entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reels.The bottom line, here, is that Tobias Schneebaum is a fraud. Pure and simple. I know that I have not read the book, but I am still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own. This documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an avid fan of Schneebaums work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a DVD. Schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy, striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that his story is remarkably unriveting. If you are looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism, turn away because Keep The River To Your Right is an embarrassingly hilarious selfserving rant over a man who is long overdue for a straightjacket and a gag.","label":0},{"index":2845,"txt":"The plot is straightforward an old man living off a main road in woodland one day witnesses a man murdering a child in the woods.

Soft For Digging has a diminutive dialogue which reflects the majority of the scenes of the film, an old man living by himself in a house. During the film I found that I was scared twice namely when the murdered child abruptly appears before the old man. The rest of the film I have to admit did not engage me; I found the tempo of the film a little too slow. The limited dialogue was not a problem.

The problem is, they do not existOllie apparently made them up! So, it is up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family.This is not a particularly unique story idea, as I have seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot. The best of these was Bobby Vernons Do not KID ME. It is much better than ONE TOO MANYprobably much of this was due to it being made a decade laterwhen comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick. Now I am not against physical comedy, but in some slapstick films, people starting shooting guns wildly, kick and strangle each other, etc. with little provocation. Sadly, at the end of ONE TOO MANY, that is exactly what they do. None of it makes sense and it was as if they would just run out of story ideas.Overall, not exactly a milestone in entertainment. There is just not enough payoff to merit watching it unless you are an obsessive silent fan like myself.","label":0},{"index":2851,"txt":"Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy had extensive separate film careers before they were eventually teamed. For many of Ollies preStan films, he was billed on screen as Babe Hardy ... and throughout his adult life, Hardy was known to his friends as Babe. While touring postwar Britain with Laurel in a musichall act for Bernard Delfont, Hardy gave an interview to journalist John McCabe in which he explained the origin of this nickname early in his acting career, Hardy got a shave from a gay hairdresser who squeezed Hardys plump cheeks the ones on his face and said Nice baby! Hardys workmates started crying him Babe, and the nickname stuck.Although much of Hardys preLaurel work is very interesting  notably his comedy roles in support of Larry Semon and the Chaplin imitator Billy West  his teamwork with Billy Ruge who? in a series of lowbudget shorts for the Vim Comedy Film Company is very dire indeed. Hardy and Ruge were given the screen names Plump and Runt names which are unpleasant in their own right, but made worse because Ruge although shorter than Hardy is not especially a runt. Seen here, Hardy looks much as he does in his early Hal Roach films with Laurel ... but without the spit curls and the fastidious little moustache.One Too Many, an absolutely typical Plunt and Runt epic, is direly unfunny ... and its dreichness is made even more conspicuous by the fact that this film has exactly the same premise as That is My Wife, one of Laurel and Hardys most hilarious films. Plump Hardy is the star boarder in a roominghouse run by a tall gawky landlady. Runt Ruge is the porter. Plump receives a letter from his wealthy uncle John, whose dosh he expects to inherit. His uncle is coming to see him and to meet Plumps wife and baby. There is only one problem Plump has not got a wife and baby. He is been lying to his uncle in order to seem a family man. Now, of course, Plump expects Runt to find him a wife and baby on short notice. Of course, the results are disastrous. It would be nice if those disastrous results were funny, but they are not. Most of the unfunny humour here is just empty slapstick, with characters settling their arguments by shoving each other into bathtubs.SPOILERS COMING. Vim director Will Louis who? shows no instinct for camera framing the actress who plays the landlady is significantly taller than Hardy, and Louis consistently sets up his shots so that her head is out of frame. This could be funny if done on purpose, but it is merely inept. At one point in this bad comedy, an extremely tasteless gag is looming on the horizon as Runt approaches a black laundress. Surely they would not stoop THAT low for a laugh, I thought. But they do. Runt steals the womans black infant and tries to fob this off as Plumps progeny.Somehow, Plump acquires an infants cot, but he still has not got a baby. With Uncle John coming up the stairs, Plump conscripts Runt for babyhood. This gag might just possibly have worked with a midget, or even with a truly runtsized actor such as Chester Conklin, but Billy Ruge is only slightly below average height. Ruges impersonation of a baby is neither believable nor funny, and Uncle John would have to be a complete moron to fall for it. Amazingly, he does!The most notable aspect of One Too Many is a brief appearance  apparently her onlyever film appearance  by Madelyn Saloshin, Oliver Hardys first wife. The marriage was not a happy one, although Hardys marital troubles never attained the epic proportions of Stan Laurels. Only one thing in this movie impressed me. There is a very brief flashback sequence, with Hardy reminiscing about his seaside romance with a bathing beauty. In 1916, there was still not yet a standard film grammar for conveying flashbacks the one shown here is done gracefully and simply. Too bad this movie has no other merits. One Too Many is definitely one film too many on Oliver Hardys CV, and I will rate this movie just one point out of 10. Laurel and Hardy together are definitely much funnier than either of them separately.","label":0},{"index":2852,"txt":"When the folks at Kino Video assembled their fine Slapstick Encyclopedia collection, a multicassette selection of silent comedies, someone decided to kick off the first installment with ONE TOO MANY 1916, an obscure onereel farce made in Florida starring the very young Oliver Hardy. As enjoyable as the set is over all, this decision was an unfortunate one, for ONE TOO MANY is a very poor film which almost discourages the viewer from watching further. Like any typical farce, this one involves deception inspired by greed, panic when plans go awry, and complications escalating to the point of absurdity, but unlike the good ones, ONE TOO MANY is incoherent, unfunny, and downright annoying. It is hard to tell at this point whether the hopelessly confusing plot is the result of missing footage or inept filmmaking, but whatever the cause, by the halfway point even the most alert viewer has no idea what the character relationships are or what is happening, and by the end one no longer cares.The only point of interest here is seeing the 24 yearold Babe Hardy, who appears considerably heavier than he would a decade later when he teamed with Stan Laurel, but who is nonetheless full of youthful energy. In the opening scene, awakening with a hangover, Babe performs a highly athletic backward roll off a bed. Trust me, that is as funny as this movie gets. If you read this before seeing the first cassette of Kinos Slapstick Encyclopedia I suggest you fastforward past this one and skip to the good stuff.","label":0},{"index":2853,"txt":"A sentimental school drama set in Denmark, 1969, We Shall Overcome offers a pathetic Danish take on US culture.

The central performance of DayLewis is indeed remarkable and amazing, but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing less.The fatal misjudgement in my eyes was that in becoming obsessed with proving the normalcy of this man; the movie chose to show him as a complete and utter jerk. On the one hand I can see that this is a logical correlation; mankind always has the capacity to be objectionable, and disability should not obscure that. I just wish that impartial onlookers would not be so forgiving of aberrant behaviour and assume that circumstances automatically make it forgivable. They do not. Acting out is normal, and so yes, disabled people act out  but they do not do it because they are disabled; they do it because they are being unreasonable. A physical impairment does not afford you the right to throw a hissy fit in public, just because someone you love turns you down.There are certain things it is unwise to do whether you are disabled or ablebodied. Giving someone tacit permission to boot a football directly at your head for the sole purpose of fitting in is one of them. Admittedly, I did once save a penalty from the schools star striker with my face, but I already belonged by then. It was not for acceptance. Engaging in a bar brawl is another. Revelling in the fact that your father only extends companionship to you after you have proved yourself capable of metaphorically jumping through physical hoops takes masochism a step too far. All of these things are stupid, and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your bravery does not make them any less foolhardy.So yes; just because you have overcome obstacles to achieve great things does not make you any less of a jerk...

Or perhaps it is seeing something which brought me joy and fond memories as a child being treated to a super KMart fashion makeover. At any even, the result is decidedly disappointing and silly even for Munster standards.

Most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humor that made the shows so special. THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is among the most disappointing because it goes for a Laurel and Hardytype comedy style that really was not in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series, is completely wasted  she has less time here in this 90 minute movie than she did in any single 30 minute episode. And since the roles of Eddie and Marilyn in this movie are nothing more than cameos, what was the point of making them younger and recasting them? With very little rewriting, they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although seeing some of the Munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch, I did not enjoy Sid Caesar as the hammy mad scientist mainly because there is too much of him and not enough of the underused Munsters ironically that very year, 1981, Caesars old partner in comedy, Imogene Coca, was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a TV movie reunion RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES.

Why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a typical if strange American family, not famous monsters? This was the last Munsters project featuring the original cast in their roles, there was an awful revival of the series in the late 1980s with a completely new cast and a 1990s TV movie which featured DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest, and Patrick in cameo roles as a family dining.","label":0},{"index":2880,"txt":"This film is the freshman effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company.

I have not heard and seen such wooden acting since Troll 2. There are plenty of scenes with nudity and sex, but they are clearly jumped into too fast. The characters are morons and entirely forgettable. The ending which I will not spoil can be easily anticipated after watching the very first scene.

It suffers terribly in almost every aspect except for one the finished product is such an awful film that it is actually hysterically funny to watch. This is a very lowgrade film. Budget constraints for the film should be obvious to anyone who watches even just the opening title sequence. I am not sure if much of the humour in the film was intended or not. For example, the movie takes place in Doomsville. Note to all prospective home buyers if the town you are moving to is called Doomsville, keep moving. Stephanie Beaton is quick to pull off her top for a pretty enthusiastic sex scene in the kitchen. I could not help but laugh because it has intentional humour she turns on the gas stove ... get it? The sex is THAT hot? get it? and unintentional humour. The unintentional in this case is the music. It is like the theme music for Chariots of Fire goes Electronica. Break out the computer and the synthesizers! I realize that coming up with music for a small production like this is cost prohibitive. I really feel for them because the work here is so wellintentioned. The problem is that cheap music is not necessarily good music. I have not laughed so hard at sex on screen since Alone in the Dark with that Seven Seconds song I guess they were implying that poor old Mr. Slater was a bit ... quick on the draw?. Even the end credits are hilarious. Intentional or not? You be the judge a pet dog and cat are part of the credited cast  and an animal wrangler was on set for them!  The boom is credited to Mr B. Stick, and the 3rd Unit is wardrobe Yep, they had a third unit is credited to Kmart. Maybe it is just me, but I think the hilarity of this more than saves the film. The movie is very, very bad, but the goals of Stephanie Beaton, her friends and family are so wellintentioned in The Bagman that you cannot help but like the movie they have produced. The Bagman is bad but not dreadful. In its own sweet way, it even manages to be a bit endearing. It wears its flaws so honestly that you cannot help but forgive them. Better films that try to hide the flaws are almost worse in a way. I guess this is just a film that knew who its audience was and was produced accordingly.Watch any number of movies and most of them will probably be a lot better than this. Some of them might look cheaper, or have worse acting, or sillier production value. They may not suffer terribly as The Bagman does from awful editing, sound, and foley effects. Mr B. Stick did not do a very good job. The special effects look to be where most of the money went. They tend to be more funny than gruesome, although when the Bagman is finally unmasked at the end, the makeup job there is surprisingly well done.My 4 out of 10 is a little high but the humour helped a lot.

I purchased the film, and I swore to myself that I would be objective; I knew that sometimes artistic liberties would be taken from the original series. I was not even prepared for what I was about to watch.There was barely a shred of the original show still intact.Here is a short list of just some of the cons for this movie The humor is nonexistent from the original series.Penny and Brain originally having a nearly equal part in the series as Gadget are missing from the action for fifteen to twenty minute intervals.The original music by Saban  Levy is not there, and the score that exists is subpar. Understood that Saban has his own production company now, but at least Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas had good music, even without Saban. Do not expect to see any of Gadgets gadgets which made the show so endearing, such as gadgetcopter, gadgetbrella, gadgetmallet,gadgetcoat which actually was used but it was not even called the same thing, as well as his standard other hat and hand gadgets. In this movie, his gadget legs were telescopic instead of springs. That kind of stuff annoys true fans of the show, and simply are not necessary to change.The gadgetmobile from the original series is now a fasttalking, supposedly hip convertible. All the fans from the original series enjoyed the gadgetmobile transforming into the gadget van and vice versa.Chief Quimby is now very shorttempered and even mean to Gadget. He was always grumpy in the original series, but this pushes the situation a bit much.Penny no longer has a computer book.Are there any positives to this movie? OK, here goes...Maurice LaMarche does a good job of taking over for the great Don Adams as Inspector Gadget.In one scene, Chief Quimby alludes to an actual villain from the cartoon series the Great Wambini classic Gadget villain from the second season, voiced by Louis Nye.Looking for more redeeming factors for this movie? Well, you are out of luck. Life is about making choices and living by those choices. Most situations in life have a purpose even if it is to teach a lesson. The lesson learned here keep to the original formula! If it as not broke, do not fix it. True Gadget fans should steer clear from this movie; you will surely be disappointed.Hopefully, DiC and Shout! Factory will continue to release more of the original series after the 2006 release of Inspector Gadget The Original Series, Volume 1, containing the first 22 episodes of the series.

The composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but it is still just no good enough. The Gadgetmobile is now a talking car, not a car that can turn into a van. Plus it looks a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool. Penny no longer has her computer book and she and Brain hardly make an appearance at all.The plot is nonexistent.

On the other hand, the movies main pretension to depth follows the lovers to a presentation of Bent a play about gays in a Nazi labor camp. The scene on stage is awkwardly rushed, undermining its erotic power understandable given the constraints of filmtime, but still this could have been edited to much better effect. and comes off as flimsily as the rest of the film.

When a Palestinian woman goes into the fastest labor on record Israeli soldiers are solicitous and helpful, an ambulance shows up in minutes. The outcome of the birth serves to show the Palestinians as unappreciative of Israeli beneficence and even downright paranoiac. Altogether the checkpoint is shown as a mere nuisance, not the series of bonenumbing, soulcrushing, humiliating obstructions with no regard for medical care or necessity in cases of birth, death, or severe illness. Ashraf, the Palestinian lover, seems to get through from Nablus to Tel Aviv with no problems, no papers, no hassles. He just shows up whenever he likes. When the Israelis want to get through it is much more of a challenge involving a scheme worthy of Lucy Ricardo.Against the backdrop of nice, supportive Israelis and surly homophobic Palestinians we move to a resolution that is utterly lacking in motivation or purpose \u0096 except as a painfully obvious dramatic device to milk sympathy for the forbidden lovers.Gay IsraeliPalestinian romance has been handled on stage with much more skill and depth as in Saleems SalaamShalom so this film is hardly even as groundbreaking as some people would like to think.Gloriously bad films \u0096 like the works of Ed Wood  at least have some striking idiosyncrasy to distinguish them.

The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director and, even worse, such a talented Israeli director, is a crying shame.

The only movie to which I can compare it is Eraserhead my secondleastfavorite film of all time, which was by intent much more depressing, but I still found What Is It? a total waste of my time. It is one thing to give me a peek into the inner workings of someone elses mind  even someone elses chemically altered consciousness  but quite another to just throw weird visuals at me purely for the sake of weirdness.","label":0},{"index":2893,"txt":"I saw his film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I am a film student at the Univeristy of Michigan so I know a thing or two about film. And Crispin Glovers film is outrageous. He basically exploits the mentally challenged. Not only is Shirly Temple the antiChrist which I admit is a little funny telling the mentally challenged to kill each other, but there is an obsession with killing snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are, mentally challenged. PETA and Human Rights should be all over this thing. It is not counterculture as Crispin stated at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, it is exploitation.","label":0},{"index":2894,"txt":"I saw Crispin Glovers What Is It? at the Ann Arbor film festival. Admittedly, the film was at least aptly named, because I got the distinct sense that even the writerdirector could provide no answer. At the question and answer session after the screening, Mr. Glover said that the film was originally meant to be a short film to show the virtue of using actors with downsyndrome. However, this is in itself not enough of a reason to create a film. Actors are, in my opinion, building blocks for a larger vision  a larger vision that seemed muddled at best and absent at worst.Crispin Glover also said that he wanted to address taboo subjects. Well, he does do that. But why? The film seems to have no stance, no reason for addressing anything. Does he feel these things should not be taboo? The film does not even give me an indicator of that. Taboo for the sake of taboo is not interesting. It cannot even afford to make the taboo disturbing or inciting on any level because he has not made the audience care in any way. Ignoring problems with the concept for a moment, the thing that actually shocked me most was how poorly the film was put together. The editing, cinematography, and other technical aspects seemed frequently to be extremely amateur. Glover said 125150 thousand dollars went into the movie, and I feel that the money should have been spent on different designers Glover actually did some design himself  I know I saw at least sound design in the credits. The painted sets are okay not great, but used poorly. Parts feel like a photographed stage play  which would be fine if that went to any sort of purpose, but in Glovers hands it just feels sloppy. Other parts are filmed like a sort of Home Movie, of inferior quality to a lot of the stuff I see firsttime filmmakers do on iMovie.Perhaps the biggest problem with What Is It? is I cannot even understand how seriously the film is to be taken. There are some parts that feel like Glover is screaming at you to think seriously. At other points, he seems off on his own little joke. Perhaps he meant for this to be ironic, or meaningful in some way, but I just felt that Glover could not even get himself to give his film any sort of serious attention.Glover said he originally wanted it to be a short film. If only it had been. At seventytwo minutes, the film runs out of imagery and ideas in the first twenty, and it is arguable if the ideas were formulated enough to claim that they were even there for that period of time.","label":0},{"index":2895,"txt":"I firstly and completely and confidently disagree with the user who calls this a spoof.

The mere mention of Crispin Glover is enough to send some geeks panties in a bunch. His landmark appearance in Back to the Future as George McFly has sealed him into the American conscience forever. More recently, he has been trying to get back into the culty subconscious with Bartleby and Willard.This time, however, Crispin has made a 76minute, cheap dada film. At times it reminded me of genius, while overall it almost insulted me, but not because of its content. Content? What Is It? is a movie where, in one half of the movie, all of the actors have Downs Syndrome, giving it a freakshow feel to it. The other half of the movie includes Crispin Glover, Adam Parfrey, and a guy with cerebral palsy. This all had the feel of what John Waters was attempting to do with Desperate Living, and simultaneously feeling more successful and failing miserably.The half with the Downs Syndrome actors also features many many killed snails. It is about a guy who has snails, and ends up killing one. He is also tormented by a bunch of other people, and a grasshopper. He falls in love with 2 girls, one of which he has sex with in a graveyard. He also has a falling out with a friend who teases him.In a weird semiinterior set, Crispin Glover is the director of this show. He is something like the control of the guys mind, and the cerebral palsy guy is something like the sexuality. Well, he at least gets masturbated in explicit scenes. There is other shocking imagery made humorous, like Nazi Swaztikas crossed with Shirley Temple, and minstrels in black face saying they are Michael Jackson.In the outside world, the tormentor is still dealing with his love of killing snails and being beaten by the other people. They beat him with rocks, and such. Later, they beat the minstrel after putting him on trial.Back to the interior, Crispin Glover is still the ruler of his set, and tries to control everybody, but fails miserably.What Is It? makes less sense than Dr. Caligari, and has more than a passing style stolen from it. The claustrophobic mental space feels very much like the way the nowall sets of Dr. Caligari felt claustrophobic. They also had some dialogue that was absolute nonsense. And, it was all wrapped up with absurdist imagery for humor.The problem is, about 20 minutes into the movie...maybe a little more...What Is It? runs out of imagery. For the next 56 minutes, we keep running on the same sets of images, only introducing new imagery in the form of an absurdist puppet show. The movie seems little more than a movie which attempts to push the envelope in offensive and taboo imagery. It tries to mock and confuse the audience. But, the issue is that it only has enough different imagery for a 40 minute movie.Even worse than that, the cinematography, set design, and everything else felt very very cheap and almost unplanned. It felt like OK, this is the way we can do it and get it out of the way. It did not feel interesting, and was quite...boring. Dr. Caligari, on the other hand, had amazing cinematography and framing. The difference between the two is quite astounding.rating C","label":0},{"index":2897,"txt":"The words Swedish and Action movie do not mix.

Peter Ustinov tries hard here to bring something to life but the result is a dour bore that misses all the right beats that might have made it watchable. Regardless of the favorable comments here, this film is awful. Badly directed. Badly edited. Badly acted. Badly written. You need to sit through a hundred movies to come across one this bad.The muddled and excruciatingly laggard plot concerns Ustinov conning his way into an American insurance company in order to hack their computer and embezzle millions of pounds. How he does it is beyond lameness and credibility he just learns his computer skills seemingly overnight by reading some pamphlets, and hoodwinks computer expert Robert Morley into going to South America and stealing his identity.As a side plot, Ustinov romances fellow loner Maggie Smith, who just happens to become his secretary by chance after he gets a flat in her building. She ends up sharing scenes that have sexual undertones with Bob Newhart that go nowhere, while Ustinov goes about grafting the money bit by bit and trying to keep one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden. Then he Marries Smith and they fly off to Brazil, which has become the staple finale of almost every British caper comedy since Nuns on the Run? A Fish Called Wanda?The surprise twist of an ending is more laughable than everything that came before. By the end I was thinking I must be truly off my rocker to stick out drivel like this.

I have heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies, including everything from Halloween to Prom Night to Carrie, and as much as I hate to be redundant, the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything. The punch bowl over poor Jeremys head early in the film is so obviously taken from Carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie Hey everyone, this is the director, and the following is my Carrieripoff scene. Enjoy!. But that is just a suggestion.spoilers The film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured. We get to know some girl briefly at the beginning, she gets killed, people wonder in the old ohbutthatstuffonlyhappenstootherpeople tone, and then THEY start to get killed. The problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful, but they have no idea how to do it. Take Jason, for example. Here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had, and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor Jeremy was treated, he is assumed to carry some significance. Besides that, and more importantly, he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade, and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious Valentines Day cards. It is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects, and Jason is a perfect example of the effort, but not such a good example of a successful effort. Sure, I thought for a while that he might very well be the killer, but that is not the point. We know from early on that he is terrible with women, which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film, but then in the middle of the film, he appears at a party, smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls, and then gives them a hateful look and walks away, disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation. We already know he is a cardboard character, but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him.On the positive side, the killers true identity was, in fact, made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also, unfortunately, yet another ripoff. Early in the film, when Shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel, he makes no sound, suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female, rather than a male as everyone suspects. But then for the rest of the film, we just have this stolid, relentless, unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife. Director Jamie Blanks who, with all due respect, looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade mentions being influenced by Halloween. This is, of course, completely unnecessary, because it is so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film. The only difference between the killer in Valentine and Michael Meyers is that Michaels mask was so much more effective and he did not have a problem with nosebleeds. This stuff is shameless. At the end, there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is complete with slow and drawn out andthekilleris mask removal, but then we see Adams nose start to bleed as he holds Kate, his often reluctant girlfriend, and we know that he is been the killer all along. Nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act, and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film. Valentine is not scary I watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight, and I have been afraid of the dark for as long as I can remember, and even I was not scared, and the characters might be possible to care about if it were not so obvious that they were just going to die.

Ustinov plays a small time crook just out of prison who sets his sites on a large American corporation based in London. Bluffing his way past dimwitted CEO Karl Malden and tech geek Newhart, Ustinov passes himself off as a computer expert and immediately plans the perfect heist part of the film. To do this he needs to get passed a tamper proof security system that guards the corporation mainframe. And here is problem one. His perfect plan only works because everyone else in the film is remarkably trusting and stupid. His lame excuses are taken at face value and this must be the only computer center anywhere not to bother with video cameras. The second problem is the heist fraud really happens within the first 30 minutes of the film robbing the rest of the picture of much in way of dramatic tension. Maggie Smith is sadly miscast as Ustinovs ditsy next door neighborsecretary who just cannot keep a job. I love Maggie Smith but she just seems too together here, too composed, the part called for more of a wacky, physical comedian. Furthermore, Ustinov and Smith have no chemistry together, maybe it is the age difference, but the later romantic relationship, as devoid of actual romance as it is, still comes off a little creepy.

With her bland suits and superfluous hair gel, Young does a decent job at convincing the audience of her devout hatred for men. Why else would she ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute just so she can arrest cops who try to pick up on them? This hatred is also the only reason why she relentlessly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this crappy movie. Watching Young go from frigid to fullfrontal nudity does little to raise interest, but the temper tantrum she throws standing next to a fire by a lake does. Watching her rant and rave about her selfloathing and sexual frustration makes Love Crimes worth the rental fee, but it is all downhill to and from there. Despite her urge to bring Patrick Bergins character to justice, her policing skills completely escape her in the throes of her own tired lust and passion. Patrick Bergin does a decent enough job as a slimy sociopath; if it worked in Sleeping With the Enemy it sure as hell can work in this.

This is one fatally inhibited actress.One has only to compare Young to the performer playing her coworker and best friend, Arnetia Walker, to grasp what is missing in Young. Walker is open, emotional, and at ease at all times...in that there is no apparent barrier between what she may be feeling and her expression of it. She is an open book. Young, on the other hand, acts in the skittish, selfconscious way you might expect your neighbor to act were they suddenly thrown into starring in a film. Basically, she does not have a clue.With this major void looming at the center of the movie, we are left to ponder the implausiblities of the story. For instance, after Miss Young is kidnapped by the criminal she is trailing and locked in a closet, she breaks the door down when left alone. Granted, she is dressed only in a bra and panties, but in a similar situation, with a psycho captor due to return any moment, would you head for the door...or take the time to go through his dresser, take out some clothes and get dressed? I would guess that this and other scenes are trying to suggest some sort of mixed emotions Miss Youngs character is experiencing, but Young can not convey this type of complexity.There are a few affecting moments in the film, such as the short police interviews with the criminals past victims, but overall this is an aimless endeavor. It is too bad Miss Young was replaced while filming the pair of comic book style films that might have exploited her limitations with some humor BATMAN and DICK TRACY, because her floundering while attempting to play actual people is oddly touching.

Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keatons mother Maureen Stapleton has continuing health problems, so Keaton falls into crime at an early age via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin, yeah that is right, Vermin!

Due to the combination of dialog and gags, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery doing his best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious, not funny. Piscopo does the once bit one time too many. Several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a desk sergeant, and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers. The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film.

They are so unbelievably formulaic. And if Valentine had been released a year or so earlier, I am sure they would have been spoofing this film too  that is if they found any actual original material to distinguish it from the Screams, I know what you did last summers, and Urban Legends.Valentine offers nothing new to this genre, except a better than usual ending which, of course, leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel. As always, a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women, killing the main characters friends, one by one, in typically over the top style. Lots of TA on display, no character development, bad acting, and overly elaborate bloodshed.The thing I cannot stand about these kind of movies is that they pass themselves off as who done its?. The thing is that they are not because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked, and tells the main character who is friends have now all been murdered. Usually something that was never made at all clear during the film anyway eg. main characters mothers uncles fishing partner kicked his friends fathers dog. Everybody still left alive throughout the film is a suspect, but they are more Red Herrings than suspects. As we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealed.Valentine followed this formula almost to the letter. SPOILER!!!!!! mini spoiler anyway In Valentine the motive was not revealed, but more, left for you to think about given that the film did not quite conclude in the typical teen slash way. The issue is only part resolved, and the goal of the lead killer may or may not have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everybody. Will the killer want more, or were the demons truly vanquished?This still did not make Valentine a good film, instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual, which still does not count for much.

M.Parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for. The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch. There is no real emotional depth to the story.

Jet Lis movies fall into one of two categories Shaolin period movies and movies set in modernday Hong Kong revolving around Triads or Triad like organizations. Each genre has its best and worst films. Twin Warriors is Jet Lis best Shaolin era flick while The Evil Cult is his worst. Fist of Legend while in the recent past is the best modern era Jet Li movie. Black Mask without a doubt is the worst.Jet Li plays a selfexiled mercenary who received an injection that gives him superhuman ability, but shortens his life span. In his new life in exile he plays a pacifist librarian. When his old mercenary squad goes on a rampage, Jet Li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them. He dons a very silly corrugated cardboard mask so as to conceal his identity from the police and public as a librarian, as well as to conceal his true identity to his excomrades in arms.The version I saw was dubbed, and horribly at that. Why does Jet Li capture and hold hostage his library coworker if he is a pacifist? Is there a love story between them? Why does the police chief not care when he learns of the Black Masks true identity? The plot is just plain BAD. Bad by way of the superhero cheesiness, bad in the sense that characters are never properly developed, bad in its character interactions, all topped off by a halfexplained story I quickly lost interest in. The action and martial arts sequences are way over the top. Lots of blood, gore severed body parts aplenty, explosions, and Matrix style superhuman martial arts fiascos are present in the film. Unfortunately this is the films best and only selling point. If you want to see Jet Li playing a vigilante superhero in a Mission Impossible style movie Black Mask delivers. For the rest of us Jet Li fans it is a true disappointment. This is one of those movies where Jet Li never gets to be Jet Li he gets neither the chance to charm us with his charisma, nor a chance to impress us with his impressive yet realistic martial arts ability. Normally a Chinese knockoff of Ozzy Osbourne would be enough to engross me in a film, sadly Black Mask proved to be an exception to that rule. Indeed the antagonist of this movie, by the way he dresses, his long straight hair, and trademark round sunglasses looks like the modern and aged Ozzy Osbourne. However the villain is not onscreen long enough to make the gimmick worthwhile. I am assuming the likeness to Ozzy was intentional; in addition to the villains look, he also ran a satanic looking hideout. So much more could have been made from the Ozzy Osbourne villain gimmick! If only the writer, director, or ANYONE had bothered to give a background to and develop the character of the films arch villain!Black Mask was the first Jet Li film released on video in the USA after Lethal Weapon 4, and I am glad I stayed away from it until now. It may well have ruined my whole perception of Jet Li as a martial artist and actor. If you want to see Jet Li at his worst, rent Black Mask and The Evil Cult and make it a double feature or horror, both intentional and unintentional. Otherwise stick to moves that utilize the talents of Jet Li, and have plots that are semiwell thought out and plausible. 39 stars.","label":0},{"index":2924,"txt":"The movie was awful.

While it may have camp value the dubbing is not even close and it is flat in tone, it seems inappropriate for the ordinary movie viewer. Secondly, the director in this movie, Daniel Lee, does a horrible job. He cuts scenes so fast, at times, you do not know what is going on. Other times, the camera shakes and wobbles. Fans see Jet Lis movies for the fantastic martial arts. However, the director edits the scenes so fast that you do not even know who is who half the time! Other times, a scene is left hanging ie Li is beginning to cut a hole in the floor of a jeep, while the badguys arm their guns, two seconds later, both Li and the love interest are already under the car! Other scenes are so improbable, that they cross over the point of being completely ridiculous killer CD roms? Just give him Throwing Stars!!!!. Li, needs a director who is less prone to machine gun cutting and more to creating a cinematic miseascene. The added raptechno music goes from being okay to intrusive. The plot has possibilities but are all squandered by cartoonish characters that take away from any credibility that this movie strives for. And are we really to believe that the love interest would not recognize Simon, because he has a half mask on?

Naturally, after seeing everything else, I had high expectations. Martin Sheen appears to be acting in an Ed Wood movie rather than a serious SciFi story. The story itself, might have looked good in outline form, even made it to the story board. However, it suffers obviously when it came time to filling this notion out into a two hour movie. There are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story. There are places where they were obviously short of time and just improvised the dialog to fill the story out.

Now for this film they did bring back Garibaldi who was not in the last B5 movie to join Zack and the Captain and the Doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance. But because so much is gone of the old chemistry, this film already is severely handicapped.The movie is about a Soul Hunter Martin Sheen who is led to Babylon 5 in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist Ian McShane. A lot of spooky mumbojumbo stuff occurs but frankly it was all pretty silly and pointless. Yeah, yeah, the station nearly blew up but was saved and all, but frankly I felt like it was a case of been there done thatand done that a lot better in the past.The secondary plot, provided more for comic relief, was much more interesting, as an entrepreneur installed a holobrothel and those in command were not sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure them to close, they were slapped with a lawsuit. This was fluff, but it did provide a few laughssomething the other dreary plot was surely lacking.By the way, Sheen at first did a good job playing the Should Hunterwith his wild eyes and bizarre delivery. However, repeatedly throughout the episode he fell out of character. This should have been spotted and corrected.So the final verdict is this is only for total diehard B5 nuts like myself.

First, there is the plot, based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse who cowrote the screenplay. The story is slow, painful, and nervegrating. When Fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of a Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or b Keggs and Albert conniving against them and each other.The butler and the house boy are especially irritating. They are onedimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. You wish they would get off the screen and let Fred dance.Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. She has little going for her, characterwise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.George Burns and Gracie Allen are along for the ride, as Jerrys publicist and his ditzy secretary. The duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times.The direction of the movie by George Stevens is not well done. At times, the cinematography is horrible and offfocus. There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in London, not Hollywood. They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie. On the plus side, the songs by George and Ira Gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. And of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan.But the musical and dance numbers are illused and illstaged. At times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it is time for them to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. At one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason. The numbers include \uf0b7 I am Dancing and I Cannot Be Bothered Now  Fred dances well on a foggy trafficfilled London street. He does some great canetwirling with a rolled umbrella  but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing doubledecker bus. In the Broadway musical, Crazy For You, Harry Groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.\uf0b7 Put Me To The Test  Fred, George, and Gracie do a trio tap dance in an English cottage. George and Gracie match Fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason.\uf0b7 Stiff Upper Lip The Fun House Number  At an amusement park fun house, Fred, George, and Gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. It is the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times.\uf0b7 Things Are Looking Up  Fred and Joan Fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. Fortunately, it is a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer.\uf0b7 A Foggy Day in London Town  Fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London. At times, he looks as if he is not sure which way he is going in the fog  much like the musical number itself.\uf0b7 Nice Work If You Can Get It  A great song that is misused in the movie. During a social event at the manor house, Fred gets drawn into a chorus of dourfaced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. Each time Fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. Again, Harry Groener did a better dance number with this song in Crazy For You. \uf0b7 Drum Dance Number  As Fred and Joan are eloping, Fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. As usual, it is a great dance number. But there is absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie.The most contrived moment in the film comes when Fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. As he leaps from the balcony, he finds a convenientlyplaced trapeze  that is right, a trapeze  hanging from a nearby tree. Fred or rather, a stuntman in Freds clothes grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.The movie is worth owning on DVD for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote. The FF button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers.","label":0},{"index":2951,"txt":"This movie is more like a music video. Kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when he is making movies, he feels like making music, and when he is making music, he feels like making movies. The best thing in Promise me this is the music, written by Stribor Kusturica.Kusturica said in the same interview, that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise. Promise me this has very little noise.I liked Life is a miracle. It was also like music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later, but it had a beautiful plot. Promise me this has no plot. I was awaiting this movie with big expectations, because I have read, that the script has been written by Ranko Bozic  one of my favourite scriptwriters, who participated also in Life is a miracle. Ranko Bozic writes great dialogues, but for Kusturica they are noise, and much to my regret, I saw only two dialogues, which I could identify as written by Ranko Bozic. The other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son Stribor.Gordan Mihic the man who wrote the scripts for Time of the gypsies and Black cat white cat said in an interview, that Kusturica never follows the script. Black cat white cat was the only script, for which Kusturica said, that he will not touch it. According to Gordan Mihic, after all Kusturica comes back to the script, and if he does not, he does not make a good movie. And I think this is the case with Promise me this. He should have followed the script of Ranko Bozic.Promise me this is billed as a comedy, but there are very few moments, which made me laugh. The comedic moments are in the same style as Black cat white cat, but are not that funny at all.

As the executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 Items Or Less, a movie with an intentional indiefeel, and just be absorbed in the mentorbeallthatyoucanbe theme. He plays a alternate universe, semiwashed up version of the real Morgan Freeman, who is chauffeured in an old Econovan by a kid all the way into Carson, CA from Brentwood to research his next movie role. Why Carson, is a mystery to So. Cal residents. He could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the San Fernando Valley and found the same elements. Paz Vega is pretty to watch, a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for Moragn Freemans research. His character is only known as Him to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average peoplePsst, that is him, etc. Unfortunately, I was too distracted that Him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in Brentwood, carried no cash or debit card, or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him. If one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like Him does, then I gotta see cash and a Blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which Him definitely has. Nothing really happens in this movie. I do not believe that either of the main characters were substantially changed by their encounter with each other.

He sees the gorgeous Spanish cashier Scarlet Paz Vega and he becomes attracted with her ability. His driver never returns to catch him and Scarlet gives a ride to the actor. But first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared; then they spend the afternoon together having a pleasant time.I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, the pointless 10 Items or Less is absolutely disappointing. This lowbudget movie does not seem to have a storyline, and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega and actually nothing happens along 82 minutes. The ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous, with the character of Morgan Freeman returning to his silver spoon world and telling the simple worker that they would never see each other again. Was he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his family? Or was a clash of classes, and he realizes that his fancy neighborhood would not be adequate to a simple worker from the lower classes?

But somehow Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson turned into a cranky Latino woman played by Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan turned into Carson, California. Instead of meaningful conversations and silence we enjoyed in Translation, we get meaningless blabbering in 10 Items that verges on annoying. Instead of characters that were pensive and introspective as in Translation, we get characters that spew pointless advice on topics they have no clue about. How can a character that wears hundred dollar Tshirts and has never been inside a Target department store expect to give advice to a workingclass woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant? Do not think that stops him. If he is not giving her clothing advice, he is telling her what she should eat. The most annoying part of the movie for me was how supposedly they were in a hurry to make an appointment, and yet the characters keep finding time to run another errand, be it washing the car, stopping at Arbys, or just laying around to list off their 10 Items or Less lists of things they love and hate. I kept wanting to yell at them saying, Did not you say you had somewhere to be? What the heck are doing? A minute ago you were practically late, now you are eating roast beef and pondering your lives! Until I saw this movie, I never truly understood how something could insist upon itself, but I think this movie does exactly that, and undeservedly so.

Excruciating.Freeman plays an actor  who has not worked in a while  researching a part that he might play, as a checkout clerk in a supermarket. He visits the supermarket where she works. Nothing happens. She decides to give him a ride home and they go to an Arbys, a Target, a car wash. Nothing happens. They converse about their lives. Nothing happens. Ever.I do not get it.

Lots of people find movies like this whimsical, charming, or  for reasons that escape me  find the dialog fascinating. A common device in movies of this ilk is to have a LONG take of stillnesssilence after an actor delivers a line that is supposed to be meaningful. We know it is meaningful because it is followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen. Sorry, I must be a philistine. I do not get it. To me, these kinds of movies are not funny, or charming, or thoughtprovoking. They are just boring. Why? Because there is no comedy. No drama. No tension. No laughs. No suspense. No action.

Premise Morgan is stuck in a dusty small town where he meets lovely Scarlet who is working in the local supermarket. Can Morgan help elevate the lovely Scarlet from her trailer trash life?Realistic dialog? NOT. How about that shopping in Target. First, Freeman looks at the Target interior as if he is walked into Harrods. Then, he is bowled over at a Tshirt rack confirming he has NEVER been in any store visited by lovely Scarlet. Morgan is detached from any and all aspects of Scarlet us reality and is portrayed as gleeful in his ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet us life.One reviewer enjoyed the Scarlet and exhubby fight scene where her survival, a car in this instance, requires she physically attack her ex hubbie. Does Freeman run to her defense....naw...he is cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real, sorry lot in life. Freemans character believes a car wash and new very revealing, tight fitting blouse is the key to Scarlet us job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freemans endless stage talk where all aspects of Scarlet us reality are reduced to one or another stage related Freeman experience was irritating. Freeman is right to emphasize that Scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces vis a vis uneducated, no white collar skills or experience, VERY POOR, no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem. Scarlet learns such life lessons from Freeman as some people pay 100 for a Tshirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her lack of education and white collar job skills. In the end Freeman offers Scarlet little more than strange diversion with a star,not even paying for gas for Scarlet us dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which Freeman cares not to know.","label":0},{"index":2962,"txt":"Strange...

While there were hints of substance in the movie, it mostly did not rise above the level of kiddie cartoon. Maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book, or it lost a lot in the dubbed version. Or maybe even the source novels were lightweight. But for whatever reason, there was not much there.I noticed lots of details that were derivative, sloppy, poorly dramatized, or otherwise deficient. Some examples The opening scenes looked borrowed from the 2001 star gate scene and the Star Wars image of hyperspace. The robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized R2D2.It starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of Star Wars, but mercifully since the humor does not work gives up on comedy and plays it serious. In that sense, it is superior to the Star Wars franchise, which started with a clever sense of humor, and eventually deteriorated to JarJars annoying silliness.The agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm. The harvester was driving through the unharvested middle of a field, dumping silage onto unharvested crops, rather than working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto alreadyharvested rows or into a truck. Corn maize was pouring out the grain chute, but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat field.When it was time for Kims father had to face his fate, there was not any dramatic weight to the scene. That could have been partly the fault of the Englishlanguage voice actor, but the drawings did not show much weight either. Kims reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincing.Similarly, when a character named Henderson was killed, Chris showed very little reaction, even though they were apparently supposed to have been close. Hendersons death is no spoiler; his name is not revealed until his death scene. She seems to promptly forget him. Someones expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does. I think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case; there is at least a hint of feeling in the drawings of Chris.On several occasions, villains fail to accomplish their orders. A villain leader often punishes those failures with miserable deaths. I cannot say whether that is lifted from Star Wars, or if that comes from an earlier source  possibly the Lensman books.There is a scene where a space ship crashlands. As it plunges toward the ground, parts are break off the ship. But so many pieces are fall off that there should be nothing left of it by the time it lands.While in most cases Chris seems like a competent, tough space hero, there is a scene where she shrieks like an incompetent damsel in distress. Someone tough enough to get over Hendersons death so quickly should at least be able to shout, help, it is got me and I cannot reach my gun! instead of just shrieking.The character with the most personality almost too much at times is D.J. Bill. He sounded like Wolfman Jack, the D.J. in American Graffiti. I wonder if he is as wellvoiced in the original language.Two planets in the movie exploded. The explosions were unimpressive, and appeared to owe a lot of inspiration to Star Wars. To its credit, however, the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the Death Stars primary weapon. The dialog had a good, interesting explanation for the cause. Many other explosions in the movie did look good, just not the planetary explosions.Some of the sound effects are very cheesy, as if borrowed from a late 1970s video game. Some of the images look like primitive video games, and some influence from Tron is visible too. On the other hand, the sound effects are often pretty decent, although that emphasizes the cheesysounding parts. The art is good too, particularly when it stays away from the often cheesylooking computer graphics.Finally, there is the story. If a movie tells a good story, it can get away with a lot of production shortcomings. But the plot here was pretty lightweight. A na\u00efve boy tries to help someone on a crippled space ship, and acquires a great power he does not understand. He and his band of very virtuous companions struggle against a powerful, unredeemably evil enemy. He makes friends, learns about his special power, and grows into a young man. If he is persistent and virtuous enough, he might even defeat the evil enemy. Details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline, but there is very little more than that in this movie.In the end, it is just a kiddie cartoon.

Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young play a couple who, in modern times, might be featured on The Jerry Springer Showas they have a sick and abusive relationship...and inexplicably, the writers appear to be endorsing it! The film begins with a hungry and homeless Loretta being shown the ropes by the poor but very resourceful Spencer Tracy. He shows her how by conniving you can do very well with little money and takes her home to his shack to stay. It is never clear whether or not they marryand considering it is a PreCode film, you can assume they are not even though they are cohabiting. Their relationship is very strange...and rather sick. While you can see that Tracy cares about her by his actions, he is verbally abusive and a total jerkand Young comes running back for more like some sort of dog. He calls her skinny or ugly and these are, in a sick way, his way of using endearments! Later, when he starts fooling around with another woman Glenda Farrell, she tells her friend that if that is what he wants, it is okay with her!!! It sure smacks of a sadomasochistic relationship and you cannot help but feel a bit horrified. Sure, he does not hit her but the relationship is very abusive. To show how sick it is, when Young gets pregnant, she tells him ...it is your baby and it is mine, but you do not need to worry, I will take all the blame for it!! Yikes! Does not this all seem a bit like looking through a peephole into a sick and dysfunctional home?! Later, in a case of art imitating life, Tracy proves what sort of man he is and disappears. After all, he cannot be burdened with a babyeven if it is his. But, he changes his mind and decides to return home. Wow...that is bit of him! And, when he returns, he is nasty and acts like IF he stays, he is not obligated to care for the kid!! And, she tells him he is a free man...free as a bird! Wow, I was almost in tears at this tender moment...NOT! Soon, this crazy pair are married...and, naturally, Young is depressed because he seems to be staying as long as it suits himnot because of any love or sense of responsibility. So how can you salvage anything with this sort of sick characters? What would you do? Well, as for the writers, they have Tracy soon commit a robbery to help pay for the brat! The romantic aspects of the film are underwhelming to say the least! During the robbery, Tracy behaves like a chumpdoing almost nothing to take precautions not to get caughtlike he was secretly hoping to get sent to prison. And, to show what sort of nice guy he is, the guy he tries to rob is one of his best friends.While there is more to the film, the bottom line is that Tracy is a jerk and Young is an idiot in the film. Despite both being very good actors, there is absolutely no way they could make anything of this crap the writers produced. Nice music, nice sets, good acting...and a script that is 100 poo. How the film is currently rated 7.4 is beyond me and I wonder how anyone can ignore the pure awfulness of the characters. A horrible misfire that somehow did not destroy the careers of those involved.Oh, and if you wonder if Loretta EVER gets a backbone in this film or plays a person who is the least bit strong, the answer is NO!

Not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the chechen mafia gang.Game of Death 2 was bad and clownified Bruce, but his daughter tops it making an even bigger embarrassment of herself than the double who played Bruce Lee back then.

Michael Fitz Wong should be glad he can get acting jobs in HK, because he could not act his way out of a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter even better with the leg fighting than her dad, but her acting skills are also subpar. In fact, all the English dialog 90 of the movieeven more than in GenY Cops is so bad that I switched to Mandarin audio just to spare myself the misery of the bad dialog delivery and the redundancy of the English subs. Sure, there are some decent gunfights but nothing we have not already seen before and good cinematography, but the cheesy visual effects really spoil the action.That said, it is worth the price of admission to watch Shannon and Benny The Jet Urquidez go at it. Spectacular, and almost worth watching the rest of the movie for.Finally, you might notice some scenes that seem familiar to you, notably a shootout at an outdoor market think Matrix and Fitz diving out of a helicopter wearing black fatigues think MI2.

They use taped interviews, and take the audio to animate ite with animals speaking the parts. First off, the interviews are not funny or entertaining to begin with, and even if they were, I am sure they would be a lot more entertaining being viewed as they are originally, without being turned into cartoons. How does that add any hilarity to it? I turned on CBSs Monday night sitcom lineup, which has become a regular way for me to relax after stressful Monday workdays and found this on. Of course, the sitcom lineup would be reruns anyway, being summer, but seeing those episodes over again would have been more entertaining. I tried to give CC a chance. I really did. When it started, I figured, well, maybe it will be funny. Nope. And then it kept going. It was a long half hour.And I can almost see if there was a purpose, if the interviews were shown in their entirety, and had points to them. But no, it was just oneline clips, cut and pasted together really quick. It was like a horrible dreadful version of Cartoon Networks Robot Chicken. I was not a fan of CBS nowcancelled sitcom The Class. WHile that was on, it was one halfhour of the lineup I would struggle through. But if it came down to me deciding a whole season of that or three more episodes of Creatures....let us just say I would take the Class. Considering it is been a couple hours since it aired, and I come on here to see I am the first to comment...I guess that is a good sign that nobody watched it, and that it will not last much longer.

THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL! i am still amazed that i watched the entire thing, as it was terrible. could this movie contain any more stereotypes? harping jewish mother who wants son to be a doctor, catholic family with priest sons, big big crucifixes in every room shown in the catholic familys house, mexican whores, bad guy who is really a softie at heart, incredibly bad country accents GAG!!!! i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that cheryl pollack and corin nemec were in it, i decided to stay awake until 4am to watch it. anyway, the only redeeming thing about this movie is madchen amicks beauty. i suppose pollacks and nemecs acting is okay, but they have a horrid script to work with. unlike the other reviewer who commented on the lack of texan accents the movie is supposed to take place in austin and very few people there have a twang i think that the accents were there in supporting characters like mary margarets date and john and were unnecessary. they were also very very bad. i am so very tired of hollywood southern accents that sound nothing like the area where the accent is supposed to be from. and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in 1991 would not have been expensive, i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town the beautiful capitol building, the UT tower lit up for a winning football game, etc. none of these things were there. also, it takes about 56 hours to drive to mexico from austin. at one point in the movie, michael and his posse take off for mexico to lose their virginities and are able to drive off when it is dark during the summer and early fall it does not get dark in austin until 9pm or so, spend time in mexico getting drunk and having sex with mexican is there any other kind? whores, and then return to austin by dawn. while this is theoretically possible it is NOT very likely. and if anyone has started school in the hill country usually the third week of august, but may have been in september in 1960 they know that unless they want to pass out from heat stroke they DO NOT wear their letter jackets!!!!! in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is 90 degrees. only people with no body temperature would be stupid enough to wear sweaters or letter jackets on the first day of school. all in all, a very bad made for tv movie experience.","label":0},{"index":2977,"txt":"Firstly, there are some good things about this film, but it is all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie.

The girl who played Pony should be paid to keep her mouth shut. And, this film won an award? I cannot believe it. Brosnan is an attractive man, but we seriously wanted to gauge our eyes out after watching this for just 10 seconds. We switched from Kicking and Screaming to this, and we wanted to switch back.

In fact Id say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy . However Richard Attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making GREY OWL a serious drama . Worse , hes made an extremely dire film too . Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between Grey Owl and Pony  Played by the equally wooden Annie Gaupeau  lacks any type of on screen chemistry . But to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray Archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing hes a native American . The producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of Archie being an Englishman  Thats why I wrote  Possible spoiler  its not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is English , but its obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence theres absolutely no surprise involved.Yes I do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isnt actually a new concept . Theodore Roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told . And it should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN  And possibly THE TWO TOWERS if you want to class it as having a green message  that there hasnt actually been a great ecological film .

Well, that is the way it looks Pierce Brosnan is after all best known as Bond in Tommorrow Never Dies 1997 and Golden Eye 1995  both shot prior to this release. Frankly, the films two leads are both badly miscast, with Brosnan turning in the marginally more convincing performance, and with Annie Galipeau as Pony, Grey Owls love interest having to battle with carelesslywritten dialogue.The two aunts, on the other hand are perfect. But the film is not about aunts. It is about the wilds of the Canadian wilderness. And while the photography may be pretty, there is no grit to the harsh reality of living in the wilds. Annie Galipeau, as Pony, just fails to be convincing, unfortunately, because I really wanted to believe in her. She was a relatively inexperienced twentyyearold on this film, and it could have worked, but Richard Attenborough was maybe just not tough enough on her. He makes her look vulnerable, which of course she is.. but in the wrong sort of way.But one thing for sure, she appears pictureperfect throughout. But mascara and eyebrow thickener in the wilderness? It just does not fit, especially as she only ever seems to walk forest trials with Bond sorry, Grey Owl, and use photoops for kissing closeups.I have lived with forest people in the Pacific North West, and they simply do not look this pretty and stay so sweet while fighting for survival. Which brings me to another point the film fails to evoke the period in which it is set the 1930s. I put the blame here largely on a lacklustre script that is keen on preaching at the expense of dramatic arc, plot points and those small details that can evoke period through action.William Nicholson wrote the screenplay, and his latest offering, Elizabeth, the Golden Age opened three days ago, so I do hope there is an improvement.Yes, I have read the comments others have posted, but I am not convinced. A lot of potential, but mishandled and even maybe illconceived. If it had had a religious film, it would have been panned, but because it preaches environmentalism, the film remains somewhat above criticism, since it is politically correct. Sorry, for all that, I do not buy it.

When Archie began to write his stories for the papers; the thought of the day was to tame the wilderness and convertabsorb the First Nation Peoples.The film puts forward and asks the question; why would a welleducated, obviously talented Englishman become an Indian? Archie, as an English boy dreams about becoming something but grasping the full meaning of that dream is unique and priceless  no mater what it is. Sounds like a famous puppet story does not it. In my opinion, I saw Archie become my living image of the Cigar store Indian a very wooden character and not real at all  very well done acting on the part of Mr. Brosnan. He also portrayed the wild Indian in the dance scene for the tourist. The fullness and or reality of it were not realized till he met and married his wife, Annie. Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would bring him to the forefront of the Englishmans world stage, not as himself but Grey Owl an Canadian Native of the wilderness frontier. This is the closest Archie get to becoming the noble savage prototype. Mr. Brosnans interpretation as well as the directors is both well done. I have watched documentaries on Grey Owl and I think this is a good big screen movie to add to my collection.Spoiler  I thought the final scenes with Archie going to meet the Grand Council of Chiefs was a great a great moment in the film.

Firstly, this adaptation is far too long at 4 hours, for the complexity or lack of such of the plot. The actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available. Swayzee is really NOT a Quatermain character at all. After seeing Sean Connerys interpretation of the great man in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Swayzee really does not make the grade. This chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength, stature, subtlety, or humour needed for the part, and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor, who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast. Some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography. For example. When the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert, their tracks are visible down to the oasis, just waiting for them to walk in them. Climbing out of the mine leads to an exit on the next shot nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through, et cetera. I was waiting for Doug McClure to appear at any moment. In some ways I wish he had. The leader of the Russians pursuing Quatermain is a shoddily created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything. Swayzee does quite well as the sad father, returned to London, who is unable to obtain the custody of his son. Swayzee should stick to that sort of thing. He is not able to carry the part of a courageous gentleman with a stout heart, experience of life, and sense of fair play.4 out of 10.
