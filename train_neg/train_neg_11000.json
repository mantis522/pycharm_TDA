The tigers are always hungry, but are unable to digest what they eat. So pretty much the tigers just rip their prey to shreds. Victims include a group of college kids..the stereotypes include a goth girl, jock and tech nerd, security personnel, and those somewhat developed rich scoundrels who we can easily despise and wish horrible death.Rounding out a series of bad scifi channel flicks, Attack of the Sabretooth has some of the most wretched computer simulated animals I have seen yet. And, the final death sequence is so putridly presented, you will demand within the deepest recesses of your soul the time spent on this truly awful exercise in the creature feature canon. There is some good dark humor deriving from heads being torn from necks, but even here the prosthetic work is unconvincing. Prosthetic body parts and blood aplenty as victims are pounced upon, crying for help and receiving none. I am starting to sound like a broken record, repeating myself in every user comment I write for these scifi channel flicks. I think maybe it is time to move on to other kinds of cinema. Robert Carradine has a role as a ruthless businessman who is being wooed by his truly repellent exbrotherinlaw, Nicholas Bell, the one opening Primal Park, a resort  zoo featuring genetically created sabretooth tigers as it is major attraction. Stacy Haiduk, still quite yummy, is a security officer who attempts to convince Bell to get the investors he hopes to goad into putting money in his multimillion dollar project to leave the island. Brian Wimmer is Haiducks lover and his role is a mechanic keeping operations running smoothly.Bells fate at the end, resulting from a dislodged tooth from a sabretooth tiger statue is the pits. Carradine spends a great deal of the film taunting Bell, his arch nemesis. The tigers pointofview shows humans in a bright color as it moves towards them. The film ultimately consists of characters walking through darkened corridors..the tech nerds virus cut off the powerworried for their safety.

Let us talk about the acting for just a second, the Carradine guy who is career peaked in 1984 when he did Revenge of the Nerds which was actually a great comedy. He is not exactly z list, he can act. He just should have said no to this st bag. He should have did what Mark Hamill did after Return of the Jedi and go quietly into the night. He made his mark as a Nerd and that should have been that. I understand he has bills to pay, but that hardly excuses this st bag. Have I called this movie that yet? O.K. I just wanted to be sure.

However I probably had too high expectations because I was quite disappointed by it. First they turned the protagonist into a freak who had the crazy idea of showing off his amazing knowledge in front of an audience, in a public area. So after that scene I began to worry that it was just entertainment. But the problem is that it got worse as none of the other characters were properly introduced. They focused too much on John Doe which made the story far less intriguing. I was also slightly disappointed by Dominic Purcells performance because I found he did not make a believable John Doe. An other problem was the police story. It really felt like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and it was not a pleasant sensation. It leads us to the worst issue in the bunch, the episodic format. I could already see the fillers coming one after an other.So overall I was very disappointed by it and do not recommend it to anyone. Considering how bad it was I better understand now why the show got canceled. In some way I have the impression that it missed its target, developing characters to help the protagonist find his own identity.

Plus, much of this 64 minutes was new material such as the monstersso you know that this film bears almost no similarity to the original. The original film appears to be a rather straight drama about the Soviet conquest of spacethough I really am not sure what it was originally!

The tricky bad guys try but fail and the good guys rescue one of the idiot astronauts and then head to Mars. Unfortunately, they are temporarily stranded on a moon of Mars where they see some monsters added by AmericanInternational that are REAAAALLY cheesy and one does bear similarity to a certain part of a females anatomy.

Of course, the spoken word is different from the written word, and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film.

Three crackpot millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a last person standing contest in which the final contestant will be given 1 million provided he or she makes it that far. A series of lame pranks are pulled on some of the guests while the others engage in what most adults would do under the circumstances namely get shatfaced at the hotel bar. Most scenes are merely an excuse to focus the camera on various female body parts including an opening dance number that is a crossover of American Bandstand meets geriatric aerobics complete with hookers. If there was any hesitation that white people cannot dance this scene hammers the final nail in that coffin. Pay close attention for the nipple slip. This continues on for about fortyfive minutes until Bill Rebane begins throwing darts at various plot twists and whatever he hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene making this one incoherent mess. It is a game until it is not a game. The three old coots are in complete control until they are not. The hotel is possessed by a supernatural force until it becomes just props. They are dead until they are not. Even the narrator at the end replies that he does not know what the hell happened. I defy anyone to reason where Rebane was going on this one. The acting is dinner theater caliber minus the dinner. Most of the actors probably went back to their day jobs at the local Stuckeys. I give it a few points for the scene where the yuppie broad opens the closet and a skeleton is inside skull humping himself. Let us see Gone With the Wind do that!

This is just nonsensical stuff, but I suppose it is not too harmful; it is not very obnoxious at the least and once or twice we get a semiinteresting peek at Brazilian culture which is the father walking through town with his flock or other pieces of a semblance of hey, this is NOT America!. But whatever hope the director had in casting Mitchum or Carradine is squandered on at best pedestrian and at worst excruciatingly banal and dumb dialog.

James Mitchum is Bill Travis the man who is sent down to Chimayo by his foulmouthed boss Barnes who himself cannot keep his hands off of his secretarys rear to get to the bottom pun intended of the story. While in Chimayo Bill must contend with an annoying reporter who apparently broadcasts all of her stories in perfect English directly back to America. I guess in the seventies there was a market for news from small South American towns. There is also a radical named Sanchez that wishes to sabotage the factory for polluting the water which, by the way, also supplies the town with jobs for the locals, but why let cold hearted economics get in the way of touchyfeely enviromarxism. Pete the factory boss is unwittingly aided by the monster when he has sex with his exgirlfriend on the beach, tells her that he is seeing the mayors daughter Juanita and it is over between them, then she is promptly eaten that night. A little side action without the evidence. My hat is off to you Sir. John Carradine rounds out the cast as a priest that believes the monster is sent by God to punish sinners. You can see the contempt he has for being in this movie in his face. Might as well filmed him running to the local currency exchange to see if his check did not bounce.Supposedly based on a true story, so much so they say it twice in the opening credits, this film is awful on all fronts. Filming began in 1971 and was abandoned until eight years later when Kenneth Hartford put his foot on the throat of Monster by adding his two annoying children as new characters, even putting his daughter, Andrea in top billing with Mitchum and Carradine. The sound quality is nonexistent and most of the scenes seem as if someone smeared tar over the camera before filming. This is made even more tedious during the many scenes done at night. The monster itself is laughable as it rears its ugly rubbery head for the anticlimactic ending.

The title might lead you to expect a tribute to Pearl White the original Pauline in the 1914 silent 20 episode serial but for that you would be better served by the 1947 version starring Betty Hutton. This 1967 version is like a mix of Casino Royale and the weakest of the Elvis movies. Worst of all it is not a blend of these but more like someone scotchtaped together segments from each so that the thing skips back and forth between the two styles. What unity there is in the production comes from the pairing of Pamela Austin Pauline and Pat Boone George Steadman, a good match because both lack even the most basic of acting skills imagine Mandy Moore playing opposite Dan Quayle. Austin would later play opposite John Aston in Evil Roy Slade, with the talent disparity between them actually painful to watch. In the mid60s she was the Dodge Rebellion girl, as such she was featured in a similar series of perilous situationsimagine Sandra Dee in a dark blue jumpsuit. When the automakers ad agency replaced her with the Dodge Fever girl someone got the bright idea to showcase her in a feature film. What story there is here begins with Pauline growing up in the Baskerville Foundling Home run by the actress who played Mrs. Chatsworth Osborne Sr. on Dobie Gillis. George falls in love with her Paulinenot Mrs Osborne and sabotages several opportunities she has to be adopted. George leaves to seek his fortune and 19 year old Pauline gets a job tutoring a young oil rich Middle Eastern prince. When he tries to add the attractive blonde to his harem she runs away and goes from peril to peril. These include African pygmies, a 99\u00bd yearold millionaire who wants to freeze her until his one yearold grandson is old enough for marriage, the movie industry, and the Russian space program.All this is intended to be silly and charming but manages only the silly part. There is some effort to incorporate a silent film look to the action sequences by simulating the under cranking of a camera which speeds up the action. Unfortunately everything else film stock, production design, editing is depressingly 1960s.

Quickly, however, it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big DaddyO of Irish Cliches  religous strife. It concerns a protestant woman who wants to decide where her Catholicfathered child is educated, which would seem like a reasonable enough wish, though not to the 50s County Wexford villagers she has to live with. Rather than send them to a Catholic school, she decides to up and leave for Belfast, then Scotland, where a few more cliches are reguritated. While she is there, her father who looks eerily like George Lucas and family back home are subjected to a boycott, which turns very nasty. I am not going to give away the ending, not because I think people should go see this movie, but because it is not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is the central character we are supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life.

Filmed entirely in the Chicago area on an obviously small budget, most of the acting by the entire cast is stiff, wooden, and cartoonish  a cross between a high school play and bad community theater. Noise from nearby traffic often drowns out the dialog, and the dialog is truly bad, very declarative in a way that comes off as forced and expedient rather than natural and organic. Scenes are contrived and choppy, and even though the characters go through a span of years, neither the children nor the adults age at all.I do believe it is possible to make a Christian film that is palatable to a large, secular audience, but too often the creators of such films are so focused on The Message or in this case, their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values are tossed aside. I am sure it is no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producerdirectoreditor  and cast member.

I would have preferred to view the story line in chronological order.I will not throw it away like one of the other commentators, but It may be quite awhile before I would consider watching this movie again.Who knows, since it was Michael Madsens film debut, maybe it might have some archival value at some future date.","label":0},{"index":10063,"txt":"I am a huge Michael Madsen fan, so needless to say, i bought this movie without even renting it or anything...

Some people might find the story laughable; an alcoholic realizes his life and family are falling apart so he calls a preacher as a last resort for help. After telling the preacher his story, he accepts Jesus Christ into his heart. I actually found many of the religious scenes, as when Cecil Moe Madsen goes to a church but walks away from it, pretty realistic. I also liked how Cecil knows his life is breaking apart and tries to get help, but realizes only God can help him. At the end he realizes with the help of God he can go through life without drinking again.This movie is not well made at all. The acting is bad, the script could use some work, and looks worse than my home videos, but it has a good message. Now, just because you become a Christian does not mean you will automatically be able to stop an addiction or heal your broken family, and Cecil realizes this and works hard to stay on track.

His dad dies. He drinks. He gets married. He has kids. He drinks some more. His wife gets mad. He disappoints his kids. The wife threatens to leave.

Once he does, he walks outside and actually says that he sees the world in a different way. He tells his wife that he is found God and that is good enough for her. Flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church. End the movie as Madsen walks by the bar and gives a soliloquy about how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol. Final moment? He gives a little dismissive wave to the bar i.e. sin house and give a gay, MiamiVice, afterschool special congratulatory jump in the air as the camera freezeframes.

But I stand by it nonetheless. Superman Returns, like King Kong 6 months before it, is overlong, hyperindulgent and with CGI up to the eyeballs. My God, this stuff is doing my head in.Richard Donner had the idea of keep it real for his 2 outings. And I do find his approach to the special and optical effects to be the most appropriate. Brian Singer bombards us with so much CGI that it really takes you out of the story and constantly reminds you that you are watching a wannabe blockbuster that thinks that the only way to impress an audience is to spend 250 million a totally irresponsible amount of money on obnoxious visual effects that do not live up to the hype. We have seen everything and been everywhere that CGI can take us. There is no real atmosphere or involvement in this. And for a film that is 95 made up of this crap...well you figure it out.I have read so many reviews from fanboy critics about how the movie has soul or a human heart or tender character moments. Puhlease! We have already had brooding superheros silently screaming you would love me if you knew who I am dozens of times already in recent years and SR offers absolutely NOTHING new in this regard. Even the plot is recycled garbage. Lex Luthor a seriously miscast and hammy Kevin Spacey plotting to destroy the landmass of America was done in the first film already! And, well...that is your lot! It is amazing that they managed to draw out this junk to 2.5 painful hours! Even if the cast were likable it would make it less unbearable. But Brandon Routh has the on screen personality of a mahogany hatstand, Kate Bosworth is completely unconvincing as a Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist, James Marsden is 250 wooden, as usual and Kevin Spacey really needs to either fire his agent or acquire some better judgement. The only cast member I liked was the lovely Parker Posey. But I am into weirdlooking girls.Every year films like this get bigger and more bombastic. Pretty soon we will have 300 million films. Studios need to realise that maybe they should start looking down instead of looking up.

What matters is that Superman Returns is bad movie. In the beginning,a question for You Dear Readers, how many of You actually believe that Superman will be defeated by bald Kevin Spacey? Anyone? Just as I thought. No spoilers here. So let us get to some major issues right now.Firstly, this movie looks like commercial scene in the bar with SupermanClark Kent drinking Budweiser is only scene which looks as it supposed to. Imagine commercial of Superman, two and half hour long. Let us be serious this is not Amadeus or The Departed. You actually feel, that this movie is way too long. And special effects are not so special by the way.Secondly, scenario is silly. Sometimes even if something is acceptable in comic, in cinema it looks just stupid. And it is like that in this case. Of course dialogs are disgrace. I cannot believe somebody took money to write them. How many times we will be fed with villain making speeches? How many times laws of physics will be raped? Jesus, it is not only the matter of Supermans strength but also a resistance of materials his dealing with. How many times Lois Lane will be fooled by Kent? How many times Hollywood producers will seek for a story in a trashy comic books? Since there is hard to make a good story, why having a weak story for a starter? It just does not work. Guys, get a grip. Try harder, please. Or just stay on this strike forever, who cares. I got the feeling that WGA is permanently on strike. No offense. I am not questioning the lame money those people are paid, but the quality of the product they deliver. In this case there is no quality at all. At this point You may ask yourself is it that bad? Yes it is.Thirdly, acting is weak, which is quite a surprise since Bryan Singer Usual Suspects is directing. Kevin Spacey is having fun, but he is the only one. Audience is rather not in the mood for jokes. Thing is that comic book hero can be developed into real personality, with clear motivations but also with doubts, fears, some depth. In this case nobody did that job, and characters are not really interesting.Finally, whole effort of creators turns this movie into parody. Second unit is so bad that attracts attention, since there is nothing interesting going on on screen anyway. The harder they try if they try, the funnier it gets but it is not laugh You could expect.Final conclusion? One word shame. This particular movie, ladies and gents, is camp.

I stood and watched everyone waddle out of the theater, their faces drained like their lives flashed before their eyes  eyes wandering at their neighbor, wondering if it was just them. I mean, how could the movie really be bad. Nobodyll admit it, it is a classic case of The Emperor Wears No Clothes. Who am I to question a movie containing a guy who stops a jet liner? But the fact remains, every member of the audience is thinking what I am writing right now. I actually plagiarized their faces.Obviously Lois is only aroused by power, she will not even have a cup of coffee with the Superman With Glasses who does not stop jet liners. It cannot be the look in his eyes to the depths of his soul or anything like that. In the old Supermans, she had some level of connection with him, he was not priority number 1, obviously, but it strengthened her character that she was torn. I bet Henry Kissinger would have even won this Lois over before Clark Kent.And now it is official, Kryptonite does to Superman what eating at McDonalds does to the avg. person.SUPERMAN ONE He loses his earth dad, then finds his real super dad, the story is captivating every step of the way. He is human, he relates to people and he feels love for people, he relates to highschool students, he relates to people who feel different. He relates. The Superman Returns superman seems to relate only to Superpeople and it seems he is just doing a job when he is saving people.There is something about Clark that Lois likes, she is really internally in love with him but cannot admit it, and when he comes into the picture as Superman, it throws a kink in the ontherocks love. Without Superman, she would have fallen in love with Clark at least that is what the movie points to, whether it was the intention or not. Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and SUPERMAN, Clark is like a pile of horse maneur to Lois. Literally.SUPERMAN TWO I just watched it again. As a kid, I thought I enjoyed the action, but now I know it was the STORY that held me then too, watching it over and over again. If I saw Superman Returns as a child, I would have hated it then too, I think.There is so much heart and soul and superpower going around in this movie, it is sick. Superman gives up his powers for love as a world plot is going on and meanwhile, MEANWHILE, Lex Luthers got something fantastic up his sleeve.SUPERMAN THREE Now there is a threeway love story between Superman and Lana and Clark, only humanity wins and Clarks inner nature beats Supermans power, because when his SUPERmoral nature is gone and he is SuperHUMAN who does human things with his superpowers, she sees it is not the power of Superman that she is in love with, it is not SUPERpowerman, but SUPERMORTALman that she loves  and who is really SUPER. And when she tells Clark she prefers him to Superman, he is elated, he has made a human connection again. He wants to be accepted for who he is, not just for his ability to bend steel. THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF That is MISSING FROM SUPERMAN RETURNS.Clark supersneezes to help the kid get a strike  humanity again. Plus, it is an INERESTING use of superpowers. He is not just using straight brute strength.He crushes the coal into a diamond for his woman because she had to sell hers, love is the only thing that drives him to use his powers other than for saving.It seems there is nothing at stake in Superman Returns. Even in Superman Three, we see the damages caused by the nemesis world domination plot.. we see suffering, we see how it effects Pryor and others and people in the middle of it.. there is no damage, esp. emotional from Lexs plot to sink the US. We see a glob of crystal thrown into space.. Superman had to get very creative in the first three Supermans in order to stop the plot against him, he could not just access his superpowers. In the first one, he had to stop two missiles going in different directions and then break his universal mandate and erase history to save Lois life... this was THIRTY YEARS AGO!! In the second one, he had to outsmart three guys that he was already more POWERFUL than, but combined with Lexs genius, and the villains immoral tactics, Supermans overpowering was not enough, he had to work one against the other and outsmart them... In Superman III, again, his superpowers were not enough to win.. He had to outsmart a computer that calculated everything it saw. He could not use straight aggression on the computer because it calculated it in advance, so he had to use a benign acid that would only become deadly to the computer after the computer responded to the aggression. And he found that acid earlier when he could not simply use his superpowers to BLOW out a fire because it was a chemical fire, so he had to use his superbrains  he could not carry water, so he froze a lake and dropped it on the fire.. Now in Superman Returns, he simply lunges the island into outerspace, like a night temp for UPS. He does not need to figure anything out, he just uses his super strength. And Lex Luthers brilliance was shown at the premeditation level of a junkie who just ran out of junk.To say nothing of the fact that he threw that island into outerspace after getting stabbed with a KNIFE of kyrptonite right in the bloodstream AND the island itself was dripping kryptonite spores in his face, but he just averted his eyes and nose like it was not Grey Poupon he was looking at.","label":0},{"index":10081,"txt":"I saw the movie last night and I really wanted to like it. My expectations for the movie had been going up and down ever since I heard it was being made. Some days I would see something spectacular and some days I would be disappointed.Yet being the kind of fan I am, I had high hopes for this movie but in the end I was sorely disappointed.While I love the Richard Donner movies I did not like their sometimes campy nature or the changes they made to Supermans character and his powers.Singer however chose to take the worst elements of the Donner movies and put them in his version.While his Lex Luthor is slightly darker he is still nothing more than a shyster, a conman and a common criminal. He is no more intelligent than when Gene Hackman played him. Kevin Spacey does his best to play Luthor well but ultimately he falls victim to shoddy writing and unremarkable dialog.His henchmen are more two dimensional than even comic book henchmen. Most of them literally have no dialog in the movie.SPOILERS AHEAD Kitty Kowalski is almost exactly the same character as Ms. Tesmacher. She seems to be as evil and cold as Lex Luthor but she proves to be just an underling who melts after seeing Superman in trouble and quite predictably betrays Luthor.The biggest disappointment in the movie was Frank Langella as Perry White. I was not a huge fan of the over the top Perry White in the Donner movies but at least he had a soul. He was after all said and done, a veteran reporter who cared about the truth and a good story. Langellas Perry White is nothing but a corporate stooge. He wants everyone to concentrate on the Superman related stories because they sell papers even though every other paper is doing the same thing. He does not care about the real stories, the real mysteries like the black out and what Lex Luthor is up to now that he is out of prison.The worst thing about Langella is that he is DULL! Some actors can be quiet and sober and yet have an undercurrent that lets you know that still waters run deep. Frank Langella is puddle.Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. He is OK but again there is not a single memorable line in the whole movie. Not the actors fault. His movements are clearly meant to look graceful, like even the slightest movement of his fingers effects the way he flies. But it still looks choreographed and artificial.Lois Lane while badly written was surprisingly well acted by Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, again, for a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and writer, she is about as eloquent as any teenage on Dawsons Creek.James Marsden was my favorite actor in the whole movie, mostly because he looks more like Superman than even Routh. Without any superpowers he manages to figure out Lois Lanes message, flies a plane to the location, gets on board Luthors yacht and rescues Lois and her son.The only moving moment in the movie is when they are all trapped pantry as it is flooding with water and the ship is sinking. You see them slowly going being immersed in the water. You know Supermans going to come by at the last moment to rescue them but still you cannot help but feel sorry for them.As I said before the plot is very haphazard. Unlike Singer has said, this is not a movie about a superhero returning and trying to find his place in the world. As soon as he returns the world welcomes him back with open arms. Lois is the only one who is not happy to see him back. Even Luthor is happy to have Superman back because it gives him a chance to settle the score with the man of steel.Superman is shown to be probably one of the dumbest heroes in the universe. A big green piece of meteorite is stolen from a museum, Lex Luthor is out of prison, he now has knowledge about Supermans powers and weaknesses, and yet he is still not able to connect the dots enough to know Luthor would be using kryptonite against him.According to the movie the only thing Superman is good for is lifting really, really heavy things. The action sequences are all incredibly predictable.","label":0},{"index":10082,"txt":"I guess this movie is a fitting tribute to the first Superman film,as it is just as crummy and painfully long as the original.After an opening scene consisting solely of murky intergalactic visuals, the credits pay homage to the evencrummylookingfortheirtime futuristic sweeping credits of the original Superman film.Then there is some more murky stuff. Ma Kent sees some kind of murky ruckus on the farm, and spends a good portion of my life slowly walking up to some debris in the cornfield. Then Superman sneaks up on her and faints.Next we catch up with Lex Luthor in a scene about many murky closeups of an old lady as she dies. We do not see Luthors face until the end of the scene, an early instance of the films drive to leave no hackneyed stone unturned. Lex Luthor is a guy who does not like Superman because he is not human. Also, he probably does not like humans either, as the movie occasionally features some kind of plot about Lex Luthor planning to kill most of Earths population.After a while, Clark Kent shows up back at his old job I forgot to mention, he had been away on a five year trip where nothing happened. Then he finds out Lois Lane has an illegitimate kid and is dating Cyclops. It upsets him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame.At this point we see that Miss Lane is on some kind of jet attached to some kind of space shuttle. It is some kind of important event on account of it is on television. Then we learn that there are people in a control room monitoring this event. There are also people watching it on television and there are pilots in the cockpit. The film then reminds us that these people are involved by cutting between them for most of the summer.As the events leading up to the inevitable disaster started to build, I excused myself to get a soda. I accidentally walked back into the wrong theater and watched that movie about Al Gore showing slides in its entirety. I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns, but I somehow wandered into Prairie Home Companion, which I watched twice in a row. Then it was time to stop messing around.I walked back into the first theater, found my seat, and looked up to see that the impending Lois Lane space shuttle disaster was almost upon us. Still, it seemed to be taking forever, so I wandered around the theater, met a girl, got married, raised a son and sent him off to college. While attending my sons medical school graduation, I remembered that I should probably check in on Superman Returns, so I excused myself and raced back to the theater only to learn there was no need to hurry. It still took about another half hour before things went wrong for Space Shuttle Lane. When they did, Superman saved everybody, which was pretty cool.. And then there is a a subplot where Superman turns really creepy and starts stalking Lois Lane and her family with his xray vision and superhearing. Then he tries to get her to cheat on Cyclops, who seems like a good guy.Meanwhile, Lex Luthor is involved in some kind of contest to display every possible generic villain behavior before the end of the movie. I forgot to bring my scorecard home with me they give you one at the door, but I think he scored damn close to one hundred percent. I hope he wins the million dollars.At this point, things start to gear up for the big murky finale. I think maybe the projector was broken, on account of the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here. I remember seeing murky things growing out of the water, Superman getting sick, Superman getting better, back to the murky things, he is sick again, no wait, he is okay again.Then Lex Luthor unleashed his final bad guy move yelling at his girlfriend a little bit.Then Superman died and came back to life. I thought the movie was over, so I left.Ninety years later, the nursing home where I lived felt a little chilly. I realized I left my sweatshirt back in the theater, and I went to retrieve it. When I did, I was slightly surprised to find that Superman Returns was not over yet. I tried to ask some of the viewers what I missed, but most of them were only skeletons with long gray beards by now.I sat back in my old seat and watched as Lois Lane puttered around her house for a while. Then Superman showed up and started quoting the beginning of the movie, and since I already saw that part I thought it was okay to leave.So that is my review of Superman Returns.Oh, also, if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about one dog eating another dog, you will love this movie. On account of there are two jokes like that in it.","label":0},{"index":10083,"txt":"Special effects? Good.Script? Terrible. No plot. No depth. No meaning. This film rendered Superman as a meaningless hero, a hero with no archetype. In the original film, he represented America in the Cold War. Here, he represented nothing but a Hulk.Sure, the actors were fine. Kevin Spacey was a fine choice, among others.This still does not resolve the problem that this film had no depth whatsoever. I cannot see how anyone can come away with anything meaningful from this film, when Superman was, and is, daily created to be a meaningful hero in not only comics but also in peoples minds. This was a real waste of money considering how many directions this film could have taken.Just a few instances Lex Luthor could have been a villain of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism, and on and on and on. He was just another goofball Hackman incarnation.And Superman? For what did he stand in this film? Nothing but another hack savior figure.Wait until it comes to the dollar theater if you see it at all.","label":0},{"index":10084,"txt":"First, let me just comment on what I liked about the movie. The special effects were fantastic, and very rarely did I feel like I was watching a video game. There, that is the last nice thing I have to say about this film. In fact, I would just like everyone reading this to take note that I cannot even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing. I have innumerable complaints about the film, but four major complaints jump to mind. My first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the plot twist if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away where Loiss 5 yearold son turns out to be the superpowered child of Superman. When the crying superchild throws a piano at Lexs henchman to save his mother, I almost got up and left the theater. Singer could have made a much better Superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently superpowered illegitimate child. It is been 5 days since I saw the movie and I still want to vomit. My next major complaint has to do with the fact that Superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space. It does not take comic book guy from the Simpsons to point out what is wrong with that. I do not know how many comic books Brian Singer has read, but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. Whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any Supermanrelated projects ever again. The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun. Why not just have Superman eat kryptonite? He can eat it and then brush his teeth with it, and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. That is not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in reentry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground. My third major complaint has to do with the fact that Singer slaps moviegoers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie. I have to take issue with his characterization of Superman as the only son of a Godlike Jorel sent to Earth to be a savior. Jorel was not allwise, he was just a scientist. And he did not send his son to earth to be a savior, he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode. I will buy the Christ allegory if Brian Singer can show me the part in the Bible where God sends Christ to Earth because Heaven was about to explode, and then radioactive pieces of Heaven become Christs primary weakness. Furthermore, the crucifixion scene where Luthor stabs Superman in the side with a kryptonite spear just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until I am too braindead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future. They might as well rename this movie Superman Returns the Passion of the Christ.And speaking of Luthor, my last major complaint has to do with Singers depiction of Lex Luthor. Lex Luthor is a shrewd, coldhearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for President which he does in the comics than try to destroy the world. The man wants money and power; he wants to be in charge, not wreck everything. Yet the Luthor we see Superman Returns, as well as all the previous Superman movies, is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world. If Singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the quite awful previous Superman movies, this film might not be such an unbearable travesty. Maybe Singers next project can be a Batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of Batman from 1960s TV show. ZAM! WHAP! POW!!To summarize, I do not know what I hate more, the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but if you do not hate this movie then your opinion is wrong. I sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you have not already. Do not see it, do not buy it when it comes out on DVD, do not rent it...basically do not contribute any money towards it in any way. This movie does not deserve to make any money. In fact, I think that for every person that sees this movie, Bryan Singer should be fined 45 billion dollars. If you are a Superman fan and you really want to see this movie, just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you will get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time.","label":0},{"index":10085,"txt":"Along with 2 days in the Valley, I think this is one of worst movies I have ever seen. Just another of the long line of Tarantino ripoffs that have emerged since Pulp Fiction.

Others of note are Wild at Heart, From Dusk Til Dawn, and to a certain extent Natural Born Killers. Good films like those spawned junk like Highway 666, Destiny Turns on the Radio and this ineptly surreal antimasterpiece Under The Hula Moon. It is a comedy that aims for a certain emotional tone, attains it, but keeps going to the point of irritation. While the pursuit across the spiritworld of the desert and the casting of Chris Penn are good ideas, the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime movie, and is not focused enough on laughs to really be a comedy. I will not blow the ending, but let us just say it is bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of genrecancer.

The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares, but at least it was welldirected, suspenseful, and visually interesting, with solid acting by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a miniseries.However, the second story in the series was just dreadful, and not in the good way. The screenplay is bad, requiring the shallow, unlikable protagonists to act illogically in order to move the plot, and having characters ramble on endlessly for the purposes of clunky, unnecessary exposition. The acting is overdone and unconvincing, and I felt far more empathy for a coldblooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second. The director used a million tricks to try to make the narrative spooky, but with the amateurish acting and writing, the end result looks like a freshmanyear film school project, with camera moves for their own sake, and little in the way of plot or tension.If the rest of the series continues like this, I will be sorely let down. I look forward to William H. Macys installment, and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment. So far the quality is far too inconsistent to predict either way.","label":0},{"index":10089,"txt":"With its companion piece MASTERS OF HORROR, NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES can only be seen as the absolute nadir of the genre that began so auspiciously with THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE OUTER LIMITS.Of course, part of the problem is that it does nothing to be of any interest to a comparatively adult audience, instead aiming at TENYEAROLDS, who are only able to count bodybags, and scarcely that. And so grossness is king, and King is grossness.Stephen King is simply illiterate \u0096 in general he has the aptitude for storytelling of Bart Simpson. Since he cannot read his sole inspiration is the movies.True, the cinema is not such a bad place to start, since it has generally escaped the onslaught of Realism. But these films are only the rumor, not the thing, and if you want to WRITE, you have to dig deeper.Of course, only PICKMAN had monsters as close acquaintances. But even so, it should be clear to any undergraduate that vampires are not Dracula and Lugosi.At least AUTOPSY ROOM FOUR is a clear indication of what is wrong. One can almost imagine this pathetic dolt sitting as his desk trying to come up with something SCARY.Not, mind you, trying to describe accurately the horror of the system of which he is an integral part, making the stupid stupider, but trying to come up with a scary story for his little nephew. Suppose, you were paralyzed, and people thought you were dead and started to cut you open like they do at those autopsy things! Would not that be gross? And that, boys and girls, is the story.What about characterization? Oh yes, he is one of these suits, who never really appreciated life, you know, and now it is too late, right? And he is shouting \u0096 well, they cannot actually hear him, you know \u0096 he is saying that he is going to sue the hospital, but he is not such a big shot anymore, you see, lying there or is it laying, I can never remember and all. And he is thinking Oh no please, please do not cut me and this is terrible, lying or laying like that \u0096 now, would not that be a great story? You know I read somewhere that a snake bite can do that, I think it was that great medical authority Agatha Christie. What was the name of that snake again, oh yeah, a BOOMSLANG \u0096 has quite a ring to it, does not it.Let us make it a PERUVIAN BOOMSLANG! Sure, Steve, that is great \u0096 except that BOOMSLANG is Afrikaans, you moron! But how can you really tell that the target audience is children, and not simply mental defects? It is easy There is no sex.Well, there is, but it is the kind glimpsed through a crack in the door to our parents bedroom. Modern filmmakers are really big on the erotic aspects of the genre, the monster, the female victim, the chase.But unlike UNIVERSAL and LEWTON they have no idea what is going on. All that is really left is the giggling outside the SM club and the Fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are intrinsically evil.In spite of a certain discrepancy in size, King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay Wray. Freddy Krueger can only kill her.And since there is no real titillation in that, he has to torture her first \u0096 not in any way that might excite her, you understand, since that would upset our puritan sentiments. And so, horror and romanticism become simply unpleasantness and the grooming of psychopaths.Our hero, you see, is a rubber fetishist, and can only get a boner if someone touches him you know down there with you know \u0096 rubber gloves giggle. And that is what they use in autopsies, and that is how they discover that he is, in fact, you know.Obviously, this is the author at the height of his inspirational powers.

The dialog was stilted and downright cringe worthy. The acting was tragic. Eion Bailey, despite his best attempts to be dramatic, remains mostly expressionless. His eyebrows hint at a recent botox treatment. Claire Forlani could have just as easily been playing the damsel in distress in a silent movie. The characters were cartoons, each playing their stereotypical cog in the plot mostly random, meandering plot. Cheesy special effects can be excused given the TV miniseries budget. But attempts to create suspense and surprise through distracting cinematography added to the unwatchability. I get the feeling that the ending was supposed to be witty and surprising, but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story. If I had to compare it is overall quality to something else, I would put this episode of Nightmares and Dreamscapes on par with the NBCs Hercules.","label":0},{"index":10091,"txt":"I just saw the third week of Stephen Kings Nightmares and Dreamscapes mini series; meaning, I saw 6 episodes so far. I have to say that the stories are really weak. I have read Stephen Kings Skeleton Crew, a collection of his short stories that was published way back. I recall most of the stories were average to poor but there was one that was really excellent, if not outstanding.What I am trying to say is that just because this mini series is from a collection of stories from Stephen King does not mean that it will be any good. In fact, if his previous collection of short stories are of any indication, then most of this mini series will be average to poor.In Stephen Kings defense, I have not read these new short stories. Perhaps they are good as stories in a book and not readily adaptable to television, or perhaps it was the fault of the scriptwriters in trying to write an interesting script. Who knows. Also, these short stories may have been made exclusively for this mini series and not not for print purpose. Maybe that may have been the problem. If Stephen King had submitted these crap stories to an editor, I am sure the editor would have immediately told him to make it more interesting because as is, it is simply boring.What is clear from all of this is that the problem is with the storiesscript and not the actors and actresses because this mini series has some excellent people acting on it.Seeing this mini series really makes me appreciate those old Twilight Zone series. Each series was only half an hour but it was compelling and riveting. I do not understand why this mini series could not accomplish similar feat. I am sure this mini series had a good deal of money to make a good mini series but unfortunately, something must not have clicked.For instance, this week there were two episodes shown. The first involved a horror story writer who buys a picture drawn by an artist who committed suicide. The writer begins to see changes in the picture as he is driving homeward. Feeling uncomfortable, he throws away the painting but it keeps appearing near him. Also, the portrait of an individual in that picture is killing people and is out to kill him. I will not even mention the second episode for this week involving criminals and their loot because it was even more boring than this episode!This premise is interesting and so the story should be good but after seeing it, I was frustrated because there were too many gaps in the story as well as extraneous materials that was shown that did nothing to help the story. After the last scene, I was left with more questions than answers.I tried for 3 weeks to get into this mini series but it was just too aggravating due to poor storiesscript. If this was a movie, I would have recommended that people should wait for the movie to come out on cable or such. I would not even recommend that it be rented in your video store. However, given that this is on TNT, a cable channel, I would say if you have not seen it already, then try it for one week. If you do not like it that week, then you will not like the past series nor the future ones, since they all share the same boring trait.","label":0},{"index":10092,"txt":"i usually do not write reviews but i cannot understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers since i can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average TV watchers.i have only watched the first two episodes but those two were so clich\u00e9, it was not even funny any more. the same old stories you have probably seenread a couple of times already  living toys, evil things from other dimensions... and it is not just that these stories are not innovative, they are also pretty bad versions of those clich\u00e9s. i would prefer e.g. chucky and silent hill over those two episodes anytime. and do not even ask about the visual effects... the ones in the first episode are alright but the ones in the second... awful. looks like some film students project gone wrong. blood... or gore... erm... nothing worth mentioning.it might be interesting for some ten year old kid who probably has not seenread that many scary stories yet although i would rather recommend beyond belief  now that is what i call a decent mystery TV show. but for an adult horror fan this is worthless. i only gave the 3 points because there is in fact some beautiful cinematography especially in the second episode and some nice acting.","label":0},{"index":10093,"txt":"Man, I really wanted to like these shows. I am starving for some good television and I applaud TNT for providing these opportunites. But, sadly, I am in the minority I guess when it comes to the Cinematic Stephen King. As brilliant as Kings writing is, the irony is that it simply does not translate well to the screen, big or small. With few exceptions very few, the King experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read. Many people would disagree with this, but I am sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed King story is but a pale memory of the one they read. The reason is simple. The average King story takes place in the mindscape of the characters in the story. He gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view. In short, King takes the reader places where you cannot put a Panavision camera. As an audience watching the filmed King, we are left with less than half the information than the reader has access to. It is not too far a stretch to claim that One becomes a character in a King story they read, whereas One is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed. For as long as King writes, Hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor, without any regard to whether or not they should. I do not blame the filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive Stephen King adaptation that works.

I think the writerUmney should have appeared in the story sooner into the private eyeUmney beginning because he was the actual reality of the story, and anyone familiar with the King short story probably half, if not more of the audience knew the Chandleresque setup was due to get interrupted by the writers reality, so let us get on with it already, and cutout the cute and clever hardboiled repartee Private Dick banter already. Once the writerUmneys family tragedy began to reveal though, I thought the show developed an emotional connection that made the viewer me, at least, feel sympathy for the reallife Macys attempt to escape his sorrows by usurping his fictional creations exciting life. 610 The End Of The Whole Mess Uh, this title is how I felt about this episode when it was over. After twenty minutes, I was ready to scream at the TVOK, we get it already, the younger brother is a Mega Mensa Genius Prodigy Extraordinaire! We know from Ron Livingston talking to the camera time is running out for menot fast enough, I thought that the young whiz kid is going to discover something really bad for humanitywe know this because he is already built an airplane but almost died because he could not steer it out of the path of a tree; and, he blew up his chemistry lab while teaching himself chemistry to think the end of the world could have been prevented if only this kid had some more parental supervision.

They could have gone a long way towards filming the Crouch End sequence at night instead of in daylight, too. Things you might unintentionally find funny can become scarier when you see them in the night shadows. But I guess the budget was not high enough to shoot at night on the fake London sets they slapped together for this one.

As he and the driver approach a roadblock he plays around with his drivers I.D. not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver cannot identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers they will be killed.

Suddenly realizes that every Rawandan including his driver is involved and that the Europeans soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help. The media cameras cannot stop machetes, and there is too many machete wielding militiamen too shoot. the title comes from the armies captain saying he is going to shoot the dogs eating the deadbodies around his compound, but will not shoot the Militiamen that are killing people around the compound. Mainly because they have not fired at the soldiers yet. Finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims, flees with his tail inbetween his legs, rather than face immanent death with the school kids he is promised not to leave behind.It is more of character study, and a come to Jesus moment for one character, than a story about the genocide in RAWANDA.

Everything about it  budget, script, plot, casting, and acting  was inferior to the original. Gale Sondergaard as Elk Woman, an elder of the Yellow Hand tribe, looks nothing like an Indian, and neither do half of the other Indians, who were played by Italians, Mexicans, and Latinos with cheap wigs. And the old guy who played the chief acted more like a fat old squaw than a fierce leader of warriors. He even used the bow like a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who did such a superb job in the original, seems to be coasting this time around. I guess he could not resist the easy paycheck he got for reprising his role as Horse.To be fair, there are some interesting moments in the movie, such as Horses undergoing a painful purification ritual to find his vision and rally the Yellow Hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors, but on the whole, Return is uneven, boring, corny, and predictable  just like most sequels.","label":0},{"index":10101,"txt":"Caught this by accident on a t.v. showing  and could hardly believe how utterly awful the whole experience was.

It was bad enough to have some kind of a story presented with all the impact of a wet loaf of bread, but that error was compounded by the obvious lack of subtitles throughout whenever the socalled Sioux spoke. For goodness sake, could not the filmmakers have found enough North American Indians who were also actors and nearactors to perform as Indians in this farrago instead of the imposters they actually used?

In this film the tribe is lost and abandoned, having lost their homelands, modern life has encroached on paradise and they are living in abject misery and poverty. Perhaps this is the point the first film took us to a place where we would want to be, a simpler time. This takes us to broken Indians in a miserable world and the White Man is the hero and savior which rather negates the whole idea of the film.The beauty of the first lay in the fact that the white man learnt and discovered that real civilization lies in values rather than western materialism.

The same is true for the majority of lowrent horror flicks, especially those Roger Ebert has dubbed Dead Teenager Movies. The Hills Have Eyes 2 definitely qualifies as a Dead Teenager Movie, only here, the teenagers have been given the superficial appearance of military trainees.Some will argue the line it is only a movie when questionable facts are raised in a movie review, but I have always been a firm believer that all good fantasy must be rooted in reality in order to be effective. In the Hills Have Eyes 2, we are to believe the main characters are military people on a training exercise, but they look and talk like high school kids camping in the desert. The dialog is awful and frequently vulgar to excess. Though the films are not nearly comparable, I kept imagining these soldiers being in Platoon, and shuddering with dread.Very little about the characters evokes a soldier other than rifles and fatigues radio transmissions are carried out like teenage phone conversations; a Colonel is addresses as hey, asshole by a Private. And nobody seems to have the slightest idea what to do, or any sense of command structure, when things begin to go wrong. I think of the soldiers in James Camerons Aliens, a film of pure fantasy, and how even those futuristic Marines behaved like real soldiers despite their fantastic situations. Fantasy rooted in reality.I try to begin watching a movie as a 5 on a scale of 10, and judge it is strengths and weaknesses from there. You have to allow concessions for the material; there is no way Star Wars is as good of a movie as The Godfather, on equal terms. But both are excellent examples of their type.In that respect, while the Hills Have Eyes 2 is a pretty dreadful exercise in amateur and immature writing, it is only modestly worse in that regard than the typical Dead Teenager Movie. On a technical side, the movie appears to have decent production values and is pretty well made from that perspective. Scenes that are intended to shock, or which are intended to evoke urgency or suspense generally work. So, while watching The Hills Have Eyes 2 may indeed be a fate worse than death, there are certainly far worse horror flicks in circulation.It is worth a watch for those who enjoy this type of stuff without the usual fanboy baggage, or those who do not tend towards thinking every movie they see is either the Best Ever or the Worst Ever of all time. If you do not get horror, especially the Dead Teenager variety, you are not likely to have a good time with this one.410","label":0},{"index":10104,"txt":"THHE remake was a superior movie remake in every way. Most remakes end up being total garbage but under the very talented direction of Alexandre Aja became one of the best ever made in terms of remakes and also as far as the mutant inbreed human subgenre of horror is concerned. In steps part 2 directed by another individual Martin Weisz and written by the father and son combo of Jonathan and Wes I cannot make a good horror movie to save my life anymore Craven and if this is any indication of Weisz directing skills and young Cravens writing skills we are all in for a painful future as THHE 2 not only fails to be as good as the first but also fails to entertain on ANY level.We start off with a fairly graphic mutant baby birth which though is rather cool will not prepare you for the utter garbage that is to come, only hint to what could have been in this film. We then get to see a crew of scientists who all to briefly are introduced and dispatched by our radiated rejects. In steps our main cast of army reservist to save the day, this is where the major problems begin.From very sub par acting yes even for this kind of movie to the horrible characters to the lack of true carnage for most of its running time THHE 2 becomes a labor to watch as a lot of nothing happens as idiotic soldiers make mistake after mistake only to meet there demise not by the mutants but themselves. Think the Marines in Aliens only the exact opposite and you have the idea of how well these soldiers are trained. This is the true shame of the film as most of the Hills occupants do not get the kills you would like to see, like in the first film, in fact if this did not have THHE 2 attachment in the beginning and the brief overview in the beginning tying this loosely to the first this could have nearly been a SciFi Channel original.The Mutant Mountainbillies as well are not as amusing this time around in fact in a lot of way they are far inferior to our prior batch as they all come off as being rather under designed and uninteresting. Also the one that took the cake was the Slothlike Mutant you know Sloth from the Goonies who helps them out in the 3rd act. I was waiting for him to ask for a Baby Ruth or start going on about Rocky Road Ice Cream. Truly disappointing and shameful is the only way to describe most of the goings on here.The gore is in the film but not nearly as visceral as the original in fact it seemed toned down for the most part as other than the mutant baby birth scene there really is not anything that stood out like in the first. Another major strike against this movie. So what did work here, the answer is nothing at all. This felt like a sequel designed specifically to make money off the success of the first and not to make an actually good film.I can go on about the crappy Drill SGT., the radio man that has a speech impediment that is right, he is the kind of guy I want radioing in for help in a real crisis or the pacifist fighter that resembles the exact same character mold as our hero in the first film but I believe you get the point. This movie is not even in the same league or even the same planet as the first. It should have been given another title and been added to the Saturday Night Line up on The SciFi Channel. A true shame as a solid sequel could have been made but alas it looks like another horror movie that drops the ball on nearly every level and will get one of my lowest scores as I give THHE 2 the same score as its part 210 Dreadful Words cannot describe how bad this movie is a total polar opposite of its predecessor in every way, uninspired and downright unnecessary. Next time guys if your going to make a sequel this bad...do not even bother.

I really enjoyed the original, and the remake was fairly entertaining. They obviously had more money to throw around than Wes Craven did on special effects the second time around. Even though I still prefer the original film, the remake was done well, and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me. Bloody, intense, and great special effects. In short, a great popcorn movie for any horror fan.Which brings us to The Hills have eyes 2. Man, where do I start? The plot, or lack of one, is paper thin. We are not exactly breaking new ground here.The military has decided to monitor the area, and all of these people turn up missing. So what do we do now? Let us send in the National Guard to investigate. In true Hollywood fashion we need to make them the dumbest, and worst soldiers ever seen. Gee, I have never seen that premise before. To make a long story short, you have the mutants killing off the moron soldiers one at a time in graphic fashion. Once again the special effects by Nicotero are great, but the kills no matter how graphic become boring, and predictable. Honestly it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck. It was bloody, and graphic, but I found it predictable, boring, and not scary at all.

Sure, The Hills Have Eyes 2 has its moments. It has a very cool and welldeveloped storyline that ties in well with the actual product itself, but the whole thing is so selfindulged that it becomes so hard to follow. And if it were not for Wes Cravens production on this film, it would not be anything to do with The original remake. But the whole thing makes you go Is this supposed to be horror or COMEDY? because there are lots of ridiculous, randomly placed jump moments and stupid one liners I.E. There is a hand in the sher! or You motherfuer! I will kill you all damn sons of btches! and the acting God do not even remind me how bad it was.STORYLINE this part contains spoilers, beware! The movie begins with a woman giving birth to a mutant baby ooh la la!, and then the screen fades to black with the movies title appearing, and a monologue. Then we go to this office where there are randomly placed war veteran mannequins. We find that this is for this one scientist keeping track of people looking for mutants. The box to keep track of audio feeds is gone, and everyone dies! After that tonesetting opening, you would expect more.Then, we go to this one team of military recruits training in Baghdad. As the captain parades them A good job at stupidity, their last day of training is in New Mexico, the desert where the family in the last THHE had stayed because they were stuck. While in training, things go ultimately wrong, people die, and... do I need to tell you any more? Because right now I have the attention span of a goldfish just forcing myself to sit here and type this.The thing that is wrong with THHE2 is that it just dosent work. No flashbacks here, and the ending is pretty safe... but with a twist! A stupid one, that is. I am pretty sure the Ultra Super Directors Cut with a holographic cover and a ticket to The Hills Have Eyes 3 will showcase all of it is alternate endings, but at this point, I am not sure if I care.

Semra Turan, the actress that playing the role of a teenage girl, maybe can do a lot of things, but one thing she cannot do is to act. Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy, the dramatic situations, in which she tries to show some emotions, are dreadful, her body and facial language are of amateur actress, badly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a little better, but they just cannot save this clich\u00e9 movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot. Besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer.Even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this, it is just so boring. The slow motion was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration, and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions, not actually fighting.

So, I saw the first movie. It was gruesome, and tense, but not my taste. Still good though. For similar reasons, at this very moment, I am being exposed to a sequel.The premise itself is beyond absurd. I can buy that disasters occur in the desert. I can buy that mutants exists. I can even buy that the events might be so weird and strange that the military may decide to get involved. It is unlikely, yes, but I am willing to suspend my belief.HOWEVER, under no circumstances am I willing to believe that the military squad assigned to recon such an area would be unable to fend off the mutants. Being a member of the United States Army, I can assure that while fresh recruits may lack the seasoned eyes and experience of combat soldiers, any such recruits would be integrated into a capable squad.A squad of armed soldiers is not about to be taken out by a few mutants with knives. That is just the way it works. Squad movements, vastly superior firepower, and of course, radio support, would ensure nothing less than total victory. I am not saying you would not have casualties, but as soon as the area was verified as hostile, military training would take precedence, noone would go off on their own even to use the bathroom.And if it were discovered that the area was so infested with hostiles that the squad was unable to handle the danger, they would radio in for backup. And believe me, their radios would not be jammed, if there was a chance that normal radios would not do, the squad would have a military issue satellite phone. Chances are, if they were unable to check in every hour, a search would be called.In order to accept this movie, you must accept that our soldiers are incompetent fools, with incompetent leaders, and an incompetent chain of command. While it may still be true that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and compass, our military forces are filled with intelligent, welltrained, competent soldiers. Mutants with knives are far below our ability to deal with.With the whole execution of the movie depending solidly on the impossible to imagine, the film fails to deliver.

And now that we have a sequel to a remake and the fact that this sequel is named exactly as the sequel to the original HHE1...it just makes it worse! But anyways..Wes Cravens original Hills Have Eyes was decent. In the end, though, the idea was better than the presentation, but he most likely had a low budget. To be quite honest, Wes Craven is not that good of a horror director. He is only made a few good horror movies Nightmare on Elm St., New Nightmare, a few alright ones Scream and a bunch of horrible ones Cursed, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn. Oh yeah, and he made Swamp Thing, as well...but the original HHE2 falls under the latter category. I have only seen a few minutes, but it was terrible.Now he has cowritten the new HHE2..and it is such a disappointment! Last years HHE remake was even better than the original film. It was tense. I guess it had to do with the fact that the main characters were a family, and not a bunch of beer and pot and sex crazy teenagers. It made us feel dirty. For the first hour, we were in hell, and finally in the last few moments, the good guys got revenge on the bad guys and it felt good..This new film has no tension. No suspense whatsoever.

And then when you think people would have learned, someone else goes of by themselves! Seriously, is not more scary when the characters are bringing their Agame and still losing? I would think so...It even under delivers. It should have made the first remake look like The Fog remake which was less menacing than an episode of Becker. More bad guys. More time in the caves. More tension. More of everything.But it actually downgrades. Less bad guys. No tension. Sure we have more time in the caves, but not a whole lot happens there. In the end, it only seems like there is two or three bad guys. The last film made it seem like a whole tribe of people. Where is this tribe? Who keeps on watching them through binoculars?

This movie was awful. I cannot complain about it too much. I went to see it just to be grossed out. It did suffice, sort of. It is funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was in the very, very beginning where the woman is extremely vividly forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby.I also think that it is funny that the most notable actor in the movie was the Hispanic soldier, who was a supporting actor in Next Friday. Everyone in the movie did a horrible acting job. It was some of the worst acting I have ever paid to see. I also expected that it would be much more gruesome than the first one. It was not. I expected it to be more gruesome because it is a sequel and horror movie sequels are usually much less successful than their predecessors. I expected it to be more gruesome since gore and violence usually sell a horror movie these days Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1  2, Dead Silence, but It actually was not nearly as gruesome as the first one, which was yet another disappointment. The mutants in the first one were kind of disturbing but the filmmakers were trying so hard in this one to make them creepy that they were absolutely hilarious.I also hated the entire concept of showing the clip of the female soldiers son on her cameraphone saying I love you, mommy FOUR TIMES. It was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers, and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel even WORSE for her by showing it three more times for no reason. This movie was a joke.","label":0},{"index":10120,"txt":"This ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of Hamlet to ever reach the screen. Branaghs approach to the material can only be described as vulgar; going to such lengths as depicting Ophelia in a straight jacket, having Fortinbras army appear suddenly on the horizon looking very much like the climax of Monty Python and the Holy Grail when the palace is apparently guarded only by Francisco who shouts the very unShakespearean cry of ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack before being gunned down, and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of Jimmy Cagneys Bottom and Mary Pickfords Kate.Branagh chose to set his film in an Edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text, so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in Elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed. And Branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of Hamlet and Olphelias relationship, treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window.The uncut text does allow Branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime more footage of Kenneth Branagh. This is never so apparent as in the How All Occasions Inform Against Me speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film at least that is how it feels, which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of Gone With The Winds I will never be hungry again. This may serve Branaghs ego, but it does not serve Shakespeare or the speech when I saw the film in the theater, I leaned over to my companion and snickered Great Moments With Mr. Hamlet. Branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last, when he attempts to outdo the Olivier film and its justly celebrated death of Claudius by having Hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch, impaling him with a sword. Branaghs Dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through Claudius heart with a super heros bulls eye. The only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so offthewall funny.While this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy, it is in fact nothing but a starstudded display of a oncetalented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism. The Emperor has no clothes, and this Hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one mans ego out of control.","label":0},{"index":10121,"txt":"Martin Weisz, who directed the solid Rohtenburg, will be taking the heat, with Wes Craven, for another shabby The Hills Have Eyes 2. The memory of the legendary original, which boasted an unbelievable storyline and a dog having a flashback, will be erased forever by this more technically polished remake in name only. A bunch of National Guardsmen and women are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants. One by one the weekend soldiers are picked off. That is it. There is some hardcore violence and a reasonably brutal rape scene, but there is precious little else to get excited about. The films heroes are the usual bunch of clich\u00e9s and the mutants, a far cry from Cravens original family, mostly resemble Brian Thompson from Cobra coupled with some creatures Stan Winston had left over from the Wrong Turn shoot. Much of the action takes place in caves, ala The Descent, and is well shot by Sam McCurdy. A laughable aspect is Wes and Jonathan Cravens addition of a sympathetic mutant who skulks around his cave like Leatherface in Hoopers original Chainsaw. Weisz will be blamed for this dull debacle, but he is not really at fault because he does his best to maintain suspense and squeeze some freshness out of the contrived situations. Not a fan, unfortunately.","label":0},{"index":10122,"txt":"The premise of this awaited sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake I expected a lot sincerely.The sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and inept.

Also, the gore is not that abundant and when it happens it is truly bad.The violence is minimal and it is a shame because there are many arguments that make you think that there is room for heavy violence. I mean, there is a SWAT team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants. You surely expect something different! When I watched it on the movies I wanted my money back.Anyways this is a clear example of how rushed out movies turn out to be a mess and demonstrate poor quality on all aspects.A mess that let down the fans of the remake like me. That is why sequels are never welcomed; at least this movie is not as terrible as the 1985 sequel to the original.","label":0},{"index":10123,"txt":"Okay, let us not get confused here. If this is a sequel to a remake of an original horror classic, does that mean it also automatically is a remake of the original horror classics sequel? Heres to hoping that is not a general rule, as Wes Cravens own sequel to the original The Hills have Eyes \u0096 released somewhere during the mid80s \u0096 is easily one of the worst and absolute most redundant horror movies ever made. Part two did not have an actual plot and reused footage of the original only to further exploit the success of the genuinely gritty and petrifying premise. Craven also wanted us to believe even dogs suffer from flashbacks and painful memories, as the loyal German Shepard of the Carter family reexperienced his bloody fight with one of the mountain hillbillies. There were quite a bit of alarming signs indicating us that this sequel would be a horrendous failure as well. The remake came out barely one year ago and heres the sequel already? The incredible speed of its release righteously causes you to question the quality of the script. Do not they need a little more time if they want to come up with a film that should be scary, menacing and disturbing? With his excellent film, Alexandre Aja nearly singlehandedly altered the general opinion about horror remakes, as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for. Also, Aja is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his French instant cult classic High Tension, but who is this new director? Ajas The Hills Have Eyes was an unexpected hit, appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and overenthusiast target groups. It is a really good film and, even though an avalanche of new sequels and clones will be inevitable, it is highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of Ajas smashing hit. Bearing all this in mind, plus a rather large dose of personal skepticism, I must admit this rushed sequel really is not as awful as anticipated. The screenplay is routine and clich\u00e9d horror fodder, introducing a fairly large number of characters with few or even no backbone and tastelessly depicting how they get slaughtered by traditionally repulsivelooking freaks. After the events of the first film, the US army has set up a camp in the middle of the New Mexican desert to investigate the effects of the nuclear tests, which took place there in the 50s and 60s. For the horribly mutated survivors of the miners community that stayed there during the radioactive testing, the scientists and researchers form a tasty starter until the main course of incompetent soldiers arrives by truck. They are just supposed to drop off food and supplies but encounter their ultimate military training exercise when faced with the relentless humanoids that live inside the remainders of the mines.This basically is just another bythenumbers slasher with dumb characters who are, even after losing several of their friends already, still stupid enough to separate themselves from the group and act like easy targets to kill. It is also very easy to point out which ones will make it out of this adventure alive, especially when one of the soldiers is against all types of violence and another one continuously stares at video images of her cute 3yearold son. The Hills Have Eyes II completely lacks \u0096 as to be expected \u0096 originality, logic and plausible situations. The mutated miners are not nearly as menacing as their colleagues in part one, mainly because they are not organized this time and only just behave like drooling and sexhungry prototype monsters. Since you do not care for the amateur G.I. Joe heroes and definitely do not feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills, this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last years original. Most peculiarly, this second film is not nearly as violent and gory as the first! Sequels usually compensate the lack of suspense and the absence of surprisetwists with extra bloodshed and more graphic killing sequences, but the action in this sequel is really tame compared to the sick footage featuring in its predecessor. There are a handful of scenes to satisfy the bloodthirsty horror fanatics \u0096 mainly showing soldiers falling down cliffs or getting shot by their own guns \u0096 but there sadly are not any outrageous pickaxe battles or virulent dog attacks. What a shame! What is the point of a sequel if it even fails to surpass the level of grossness andor gratuitous filth of the original? Luckily enough the film is never boring or unnecessarily sentimental, and you will have the most fun spotting all the things that do not make the slightest bit of sense! For example, wallets falling out of peoples bloodied heads, women without any muscle power cast as toughass soldiers and \u0096 my personal favorite \u0096 assigning the ONE soldier with a speaking disability to operate the radio communications.","label":0},{"index":10124,"txt":"THHE2 is entertaining in that you will laugh a lot and cringe and probably say oh sht! and get your face away from the goddamn hole you dumbs or things along those lines but I do not know if its really worth seeing I was very annoyed throughout the entirety with the horrible military characters who do not seem to know the first thing about combat.Yes there was more violence, gore, and a higher body count than the first one but I am still am debating whether that cancels out my feeling throughout the whole movie about how ridiculous it is and not a good ridiculousness like Dead Alive or Feast.

Alexandre Aja allowed for an admirable degree of character development and when the violence started it was mean and savage and all carried out in a landscape of impeccable photography and production design. I was one of the few people who actually thought that it was better than the original and looked forward to a second visit to the particularly dark and cruel world of the savage desert mutants.The Hills have Eyes 2, released just a year after the original, seems a rushed and illconceived attempt to cash in on the franchise with little thought to quality. Jonathan Cravens screenplay could have been written in a weekend, and given the speed with which this movie made it into cinemas, probably was. It falls back on every hackneyed genre clich\u00e9 in the book while offering absolutely nothing new to the desert mutant mythology. I always let out a groan of disappointment when a sequel replaces civilian characters with the military. Soldiers are always so lazily written and never fail to thoroughly bore with crude caricatures of strutting macho bullshit. In my mind, Aliens was the only movie to successfully make such a transition, due to James Camerons talent, not simply for directing the best action sequences around, but never forgetting that an audience has to care about the people being butchered. He was also ably assisted by some genuinely talented actors. With The Hills have Eyes 2, it is clear that video director Martin Weisz is no James Cameron, and the cast of television bitparters have not the talent or even the inclination to turn their cardboard cutout characters into anything approaching living, breathing human beings.Needless to say, every character is a broad and generic clich\u00e9. They act in dumb and illogical ways, making dumb and illogical decisions that lead them to predictably dumb and illogical deaths. The latter half of the movie becomes just another tedious chasedthroughdarkcorridors scenario. The Descent on which Sam McCurdy, coincidentally, also worked as cinematography proved that even this most derivative of sequences can still be carried out with genuine originality and suspense, but we see no such innovation here.The Hills Have Eyes 2 is just a very lazy movie, devoid of any suspense, tension, or surprise, with not a single individual involved remotely interested in producing anything of quality. It is a tame and tired excuse for a sequel and deserves to spend the rest of its life in a Blockbusters bargain bin.","label":0},{"index":10127,"txt":"The Hills Eyes II, one of the most pointless and blatantly stupid sequels to come around in some time, is 90 minutes of incompetent film making at its finest. Or worst, however you choose to look at it. While 2006s Hills remake was one of the years best, and truly frightening, horror films, this sequel takes every spark out of what made that such an accomplishment. Part 2 never gets off the ground, and neither does its mind numbing dialogue. Worst of all, it is not that scary.2006s remake followed a family who find themselves in the middle of the New Mexico desert, deserted, and one by one being picked off by deranged and sadistic hill people. People who, as a result of the military testing the atomic bomb on their land years ago, have become who they are. Surviving off travelers who wander into the region. The sequel puts audiences in the same desert, now occupied by the military as they covertly investigate the hills and what might have happened to that poor family. When a group of military trainees are brought to the campsite, they find it deserted with no signs of life. A grim reality soon befalls them, as they come to the realization that they are not alone. And the bloody fate that was handed to many before them will soon become their destiny.It does not take a genius to realize that Hills has no legitimate reason to exist. But because last years remake was received well both at the box office and by critics, it came to no surprise that a sequel would be rushed into production while there is still money to be earned. There is no rhyme or reason to it this time around, just an unbelievable and ridiculous setup to pave the way for thoughtless characters, unoriginal killings, a nonexistent story, and slipping interest. Originally, director Alexander Aja made Cravens cult classic into a remake that was a unique and thoroughly disturbing experience. One that gruesomely crossed the line on more than one occasions. Its frank display of violence, sadistic torture, wellrounded characterization, and whiteknuckled suspense were all effectively used to shock and repulse audiences. The second time around, it is rehashed handmedowns. There is no style, no grit. It tries to build up tension by dismembering bodies, when all it really does is make for a been there, done that kind film, where even the gore seems tame compared to more recent bloodbaths.It is a sad state of affairs when deformed mutants who capture women for breeding purposes fails to keep your attention. It is a bore, nothing more. Hills has no bite. Despite a jump or two here and there, there is nothing very scary about this bythenumbers horror flick. It feels like something you would see on the SciFi channel, only with some Fbombs, a blood splatter here and there, a rape, and a graphic birth scene that is more gross than shocking. It is cheap. And with Hills, you reap what you sew. With no effort given, you cannot expect anything in return.Replacing Aja with Martin Weisz as director was the films first big mistake, all he does is drain the film of any sort of emotional resonance. But even more shocking is the uncharacteristically bad script penned by Wes Craven and his son, Jonathan Craven. You ask, how bad could it possibly be? This is the kind of dialogue that makes any comparison look like Shakespeare. Craven has had his fair share of clunkers in the past, but I would never expect something like this from him. It is so unintentionally funny, you have to wonder, is Craven playing a joke on this? Or did he dump this one on his son after the studio payed him off? The films characters are onedimensional talking heads with no emotions or common sense. The acting is just as bad. The only character who may win you over is Napoleon Napoli, the scrawny kid who does not fit in with the others. Even the deranged and instinctdriven villains, who we might have found some favor with in the deepest of our thoughts a year ago, are met with indifferent. You do not hate them, you do not like them. You honestly could not care less. Just like this movie.Even if you were giddy with fear during The Hills Have Eyes, as I was, you will have a tough time finding anything to enjoy in this piece of garbage. It is as generic as generic gets, and there is absolutely nothing here we have not seen done many times already. I cannot express this enough, avoid The Hills Have Eyes II like the plague. It is frightless, unoriginal, frantic, and a bore. Stick to the remake or Cravens original vision.

I regret I have to be a voice of dissension with regard to Mr. Branaghs performance.This is really a glorious, sumptuous film, to say nothing of ambitious at over 4 hours long  beautifully shot and designed. Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie, Kate Winslet, Richard Briers, and many others do fine jobs. Then there is Kenneth Branagh. If ever there was a vanity project for an actor, this is it, and Mr. Branagh spares nothing in putting the ham in Hamlet. From the stunt casting which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast Jack Lemmon, to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of naturalness, to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others. His performance confirms that, while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary, he has never been a great film actor. The scenery budget could be charged to catering, Mr. Branagh eats so much of it. His performance is a perfect example of why people do not go to see Shakespeare  full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. And if there is fault to his direction, it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance.No matter what theories people may posit on the Bard, he was, after all is said and done, a playwright. The brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless. Although there is no right way to play his plays, there is most certainly great acting, good acting and bad acting. Shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of Hamlet itself. It amazes me how Mr. Branagh mouthed it, but did not hear it. It was an example of spending too much time working out how he is going to say something, and too little figuring out WHAT he is saying.While Mr. Branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions, he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it. His direction has always been better than his acting. I still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming Shakespeare. He set a great template for other productions. And, it would be interesting to see him onstage, from about 20 rows back. But, I do hope he chooses to direct more and act less.Is it worth seeing? Certainly.

It skips around a lot, and does not explain anything in detail. If someone was watching this movie without having first read the book, they would be confused. The most disappointing thing in this movie to me, was the ending. The ending in the book was the most powerful, and in the movie, they changed it! It was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of melting together, but instead, the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs.

It is more on the drama side, character developments than a horror flick.It is not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out, or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy.honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50sThis movie is about a family who has a dry field, and that is just that.","label":0},{"index":10143,"txt":"Animal Farm 1954 was a very good read about the dangers of totalitarianism.

He did not make the best experiences in life before and got serious selfesteem issues. After a rough start at his new school, he starts making friends, falls in love with a girl and does some American Pieish teenage stuff.Beside some comedy elements, the film is told in a very serious way, focussing on Benjamin and his problems.If you already do not like this story outline, save your time and watch something else. If you do, please be aware of the following1 Benjamin is a total loser. Whatever he does, he does it terribly wrong and then he goes for selfpity all the time. For me he was not that kind of charming loser who you can feel sympathy for and laugh with. Instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind I could barely stand watching.2 The film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters just are not except for Janosch maybe. And yes, I know this film is based on an autobiography written by a 17year old  but having some experiences with German schools and German youth myself, I do not believe him.3 Showing the sexual awakening really is an important thing for a film with this subject. But I doubt that teenage boys do an Ejaculate on the cookiecontest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during massmasturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the spermwet cookie afterwards. Although it kinda amused me in a contemptible way, it is nor funny neither underlining the serious attempts of this film.4 There is a subplot about Benjamins family and his father betraying his wife  still, I do not know why it is there and where to put it. It just bored me.Well, I personally hated this film for having the character of Benjamin, being without a message, concept, scheme, whatever and it is failing attempts to be dramatic and serious. However, I can image that some people may find it sensible and touching. If you liked The Other Sister you will probably like this one, too.

Then again, if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming, perhaps they are better actors than I give them credit for.The back of the DVD gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery... something along the lines of a historical Law and Order or National Treasure.

There is the love interest, who, when she first appears, the wind actually blows through her hair. Seriously.

You really empathize with the guy and you want to know what exactly is going on. Normally a person in his situation would have several options. Somehow he does not have those options. In this movie there only seems to be one solution even when it is clear it is not his fault. Out of the blue he encounters characters who talk about church,prayer and God. And they provide the answer for his problem. It should be obvious at a point in the movie what this solution is. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Since it always is helpful. But was it really necessary to disguise this message. This religious element actually ruined the viewing experience for me. While the message is good,it is simplicity cannot escape the fact that in real life more needs to happen to resolve issues presented in this movie. The mystery that is presented to us never gets solved. In stead you are forced to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot.

I thought it was awful, though given the ridiculous story and the nature of the characters, it probably could have been a much better and funnier movie. Maybe all they needed was a real budget.Munchies, as many viewers have pointed out already, is something of a Gremlins parody. Hence, all the references to the movie. The movie begins somewhere in Peru during an archeological dig. An annoying dufus named Paul, aspiring stand up comedian who offers no sarcasm or witty jokes during the movie despite his career plans, is holed up with his dad in the caves. His dad is an unconventional kind of archeologist, searching the caves not for artificats or mummies or anything, but proof of U.F.O.s. And that is where the Munchies come into the picture. Hidden in the crevice of a rock is an ugly little mutant that looks like a gyrating rubber doll with a Gizmo voice. They name him Arnold, stash him in a bag, and bring him home so Pauls dad can finally show proof of extra terrestrial life.Paul, the idiot that he is, breaks his promise to his dad to watch Arnold a wager he made with his dad, if he loses, it is off to community college to get a real career. The creepy next door neighbor with the bad rug, Cecil television veteran Harvey Korman, wonders what his neighbors are up to. So, he and his lazy son, some airhead hippie type who looks more like they should have made his character a biker or heavy metal enthusiast to go and snatch Arnold. Why? A get rich quick scheme of course. And of course, even Cecils son is too dumb to look after Arnold. And after a few pokes and prods at Arnold, he multiplies into more Munchies.This was not even a movie that was so bad it was good. It was just plain awful. I was hoping that the Munchies would have mutated and killed the morons that were always after them, even Paul and his girlfriend.

In more capable hands, Munchies could have been entertaining.After all, it starts out like many great adventure films. Simon Waterman Harvey Korman and his son Paul Charles Stratton are in Peru on an archaeological dig. Simon is a bit of a wacky archaeologist who is always floating theories about the connections between ancient sites and alien civilizations. For example, he thinks he sees evidence of lasercutting on ancient stonework. So they are at Machu Picchu looking for more evidence of Simons theories when they happen upon a secret chamber. Inside they quickly find the animal they later dub Arnold, one of the titular munchies.They take Arnold back home to their small California desert town. Simon, who thinks that Arnold is probably an alien creature, has to go off to a colleagues lecture, and he plans on telling the colleague that he finally has an alien specimen. Paul and his extremely cute girlfriend, Cindy Nadine Van der Velde, are left in charge of Arnold, but as they have not seen each other in a long time, they leave Arnold unsupervised while they hop in the sack.Meanwhile, Simons brother Cecil played also by Korman in a dual role, owner of a successful snack foods company, is eager to buy off Simons home and landthey are adjacent to his own. Simon does not want to sell, so Cecil hits upon a scheme to steal Arnold. Things gradually spiral out of control, and the munchies, who have a mean streak to go along with their cravings for junk food, begin to overrun the town.That reads better in a summary than it plays on the screen. The best shots in the film are those with natural landscapes in the background, such as when characters are driving on the outskirts of the desert town. Interiors, with the exception of Cecils home, tend to look like poorly decorated, cheap sets, and more importantly, they tend to show that Hirsch is not very skilled at blocking and setting up shots. Oddly, given the paucity of the production design overall, Cecils home is quite a gem, imbued as it is in overblown 1980s style down to the smallest details, and Cecils stepson, Dude Jon Stafford, was an amusing counterpoint. Too bad, then, that he is out of the film so quickly.At any rate, Korman is a fun actor, but he comes across much better here as Simon than as Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon ends up being absent for most of the film. Cecil, who is differentiated physically by a ridiculous wig and facial hair, is not only the evil capitalist of the film, he is one of Kormans classic inconsiderate, boorish charactersthat was one of his specialties, frequently capitalized on in Carol Burnett Show 1967 skits. Unlike The Carol Burnett Show, which tended to succeed because directors Clark Jones and Dave Powers had a studied way of pushing the skits just to the brink of chaos, Hirsch reins Korman in way too far, and the Cecil character just does not work the way it should.There are a lot of other directorrelated problems, not the least of which is wonky pacing and editing, which completely sap any possible suspense or compelling dramatic impact from the film. Even scenes that should have been shoeins for amping up the dramasuch as when the munchies are harassing an old lady on the roadare put together far too awkwardly to have much affect.There are also serious logical problems with the story as it stands. Where did the munchie in the chamber at Machu Picchu come from? The films trailer seems to show an answer to this, but it was edited out of the final cut. A more serious problem is that, unlike gremlins, there is no clear reason for munchies to go from cute, cuddly furballs to menacing monsters. It just happens. Further, because Munchies was kept PG, and the violence remains toned down, when the creatures are in their monster phase, they are never very threatening. They are also easily dispatched, at least temporarily.Admittedly, the gist of the film is not suspense, horror, compelling drama or any of that other stuff, but humor. It is intended more as a spoof of Gremlins and the countless ripoffs in its wake. The only problem with that is that the film just is not funny, even though I chuckled a couple times. A surprisingly high percentage of the jokes are bland clich\u00e9s. Too much of the remaining material consists of nonsequiturs. Given bad timing from Hirsch, it all just falls flat. There was potential to make a film that while a spoof, was both funny and frightening, hilarious and disturbing, cheesy and suspenseful, all at the same time, ala Killer Klowns from Outer Space 1988. Too bad, then, that Munchies comes nowhere near that.","label":0},{"index":10168,"txt":"Cute and playful, but lame and cheap. Munchies is another Gremlins clone to come out from the 80s. I am not much of a fan of the imitations.First it was the excellent Gremlins.Then came the very average Critters.Lets not forget the lousy Ghoulies.But the complete pits would have to go to Hobgoblins.Is there more?? Now Munchies for me would have to fall somewhere between Ghoulies and Hobgoblins. Actually I probably found it more entertaining than Ghoulies, but I preferred thst ones darker tone. From the getgo it plays up its goofy nature which it is better for it, but due to that nature the hammy acting Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips, can get rather overbearing that you rather just see the munchies running amok. That is where the fun occurs. Mostly lighthearted fluff though, as the story mainly centres on the munchies who are either hungry, horny and destructive in a whole bunch of supposed comical encounters some moments do work in the small desert town as a couple of people are on the chase. It is silly, but strangely engaging thanks to the zippy pacing. The creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed, as they are basic dolls being chucked about. Where their personalities arrived from is that they can actually speak... and with attitude.Charlie Stratton and a feisty Nadine Van der Velde who was in Critters were fair leads. Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles. Robert Picardo also pops up.Amusingly lowcut entertainment for the undemanding.","label":0},{"index":10169,"txt":"I think i watched this movie, but do not quote me, as i may have fallen asleep during watching it as it did not exactly grip my excitement and imagination.

The script by Lance Smith is so unfunny it is painful. Every joke in Munchies misses the target by the proverbial mile, I doubt the humour in this piece of crap would even appeal to preteens. There just is not anything even remotely funny or even amusing in Munchies as far as I am concerned. The basic story is crap too, they just happen to find this creature running around with no explanation of what it is, why noones ever seen it before, how it manages to learn English so quickly  how it learns to drive etc. The whole thing is a big Gremlins 1984 ripoff with none of the elements that made that film so good. The characters are moronic, the stupid Deputy Charlie Phillips  his dad Hardy Rawls, Cecil wearing an embarrassing wig  fake moustache  his air head wife Melvis Alix Elias  more besides. They just plain embarrass  are ridiculous, I defy anyone to find any of this rancid rubbish funny. Basically Munchies fails spectacularly at being either a comedy or horror  ends up being, yes you have guessed it, crap.Director Hirsch was obviously working with a low budget here  it shows, the entire thing takes place in two houses, the desert, some caves  a miniature golf course. This is really cheap  incompetent filmmaking. The special effects on the Munchies themselves are really awful, their just dolls that have no movement unless someone off camera pulls a string attached to it is arm.

It is not a very good knockoff either, on par with Ghoulies, but with a much lighter tone to it as it is no where near as dark as that movie got. In fact, this one is too light and frothy, and unfortunately many of the jokes end up falling flat. Though I did give it a 3 for a score, this is only because there is a movie that is even a worse Gremlin knockoff. If you watched Mystery Science Theater 3000 you know the one I am talking about...the infamous Hobgoblins. This one has a guy finding a little critter in some underground place I only saw this movie once a long time ago so I do not remember everything to clearly and it starts out friendly enough. However, this creature quickly becomes unfriendly and of course more are spawned and that is the movie.

He was not crazy. He was just an annoying guy with a couple of swords he did not even know how to use properly.Gambit was boring.

I am no Marvel expert, but I did grow up with the adventures of the XMen and definitely approved of Hugh Jackmans now widely known portrayal of the scruffy Logan. I enjoyed the first XMen, found the sequel too heavy and messy and liked the third one as comic book entertainment. All through the three movies, I probably enjoyed Jackman more than anything else. I figured the idea of making an originsmovie about Wolverine could very well end up being a better movie than all of the three XMen movies. If we concentrate on one character, I figured there could be a movie that achieves what I found the second movie failed at  being a fairly complex and character driven comic book adventure.The reason that the Wolverinemovie fails is not because the competition is tougher after The Dark Knight. It is not even because of a plot development that is beyond obvious and rudimentary  even though that certainly is not good  no, it is because the movie does not even seem to try. To begin with, this does not qualify as good entertainment. There is something about the action in this movie that comes off as so very, very automatic. With no greater special effects or elements of suspense, and when one event will make you predict the following five, it almost feels like an Uwe Boll movie, imitating an actionadventure movie concept that you have seen a dozen times before. Of course, nothing in this movie is as downright awful as a piece of Bollst but when everybodys talking clich\u00e9s as if they are part of a chain of events that is so standard, you at least make the connection and that surely is bad enough.But there is an even bigger problem. Even a generic action movie is a generic action movie and, by the way, that makes you forgive a lot of plot holes and character stupidities. I think you find the most fundamental flaw in the very title. I mean, Origins. Really? What to the people behind this movie think about that title? What do they mean?? You want to know the origins of Wolverine? He grew up with his brother. They ran away from home during dramatic circumstances. Then they went off to war. All of them! The Civil War, World War I and II and Vietnam too. Why did they do this? Still unknown. Eventually, the brother Sabertooth, played by Liev Shrieber became evil. How? you ask. I do not know, it was somewhere between Omaha Beach and Hanoi. Yeah, but why? you still ask. I just said I do not know!! The movie does not explain. He is evil alright! Yeah, but... you know, origins... Yeah, well that is an origin! I mean, duh! Anyway, eventually they end up with a super secret team of mutant elite soldiers. Something with the government, hohum. Wolvie gets enough and leave his brother. For six years he is a happy lumberjack with a loved one, who ends up a little defenseless around the time Sabretooth suddenly appears again. Yeaaah... but... whyyyy?  Oh shut up!  and Wolvie decides to be a guinneapig for a bunch of evil scientist who make him a fleshcovered metal war animal. He goes after all the bad guys and they come after him and after all the fighting he ends up with his memory wiped, cue XMen the first movie.There. That is the origin.

Do we really want to know how the Joker got his scars?","label":0},{"index":10183,"txt":"Where to begin? How about with the erroneous synopsis XMen Origins Wolverine tells the story of Wolverines epically violent and romantic past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed, and the ominous Weapon X program.His epically violent past turns out to exceptionally nonviolent.His relationship with Creed is so glossed over it is difficult to understand how they have any connection at all. We are thrown from one point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run, to a montage of war scenes that they have fought in throughout their long lifespan, and finally to the present where they are a part of a hardcore government team of assassins.There is nothing by way of showing their relationship as brothers at all. Nothing complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving. The romantic element of the movie between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and abrupt. We are thrown into a romance so fast that it is over before you can blink an eye. Having just introduced the character, Silverfox is killed off roughly fifteen minutes later. We are left wondering why we should care about this. Who was she anyway?For a pivotal element of this weak revenge driven story, the romance is surprisingly unexplored. It was rushed in simply because it was required.Oddly enough, when Wolverine finds that his love is dead he leaves her in the woods to rot as he goes off to find Sabertooth. Being the romantic that he is this was out of character for him yet necessary to serve the plot in pulling off a very predictable surprise.As for the weapon X program, lets just say that after the painfully crippling procedure Wolverine is up and running. Eventually he arrives at the home of a conveniently old yet overwhelmingly loving couple. Surprisingly Ma and Pa Kent are not alarmed when finding a naked sweaty man in their barn. Is it any wonder what fate awaits them?In the previous films and the comic books, the main reason that Wolverines amnesia plagued him partly hinged on the fact that he was said to have been viciously evil and coldblooded.Knowing this was the case...did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world alongside his team mates?As hinted to in X2 Xmen United when Stryker gives up some of his secrets it is said that Wolverine would be disturbed if he had known of the evil works they committed together. This film sets up the team fairly well only they do not really do much of anything. No disturbing violence, no ruthless actions, they merely harass a few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen. It seems that Wolverine was not an evil man under Stryker at all. Instead he was constantly trying to put a leash on his brother Sabertooth which consequently WAS the violent agent we all thought Wolverine was. Eventually he just leaves all together.No conflict of duality here at all.Idiotically REMOVING that character conflict of good and evil DULLED the story immensely. They may as well have given him rubber claws.There were a ton of other errors in this film that contradicted the XMen trilogy, including the introduction of one of the lamest Deus Ex Machinas to ever hit a script.Magic memoryerasing bullets. Really?Apparently they are the only thing to bring down Wolverine. Yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at all.Another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on Wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all. Interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story. Most were in the film for 510 minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of Wolverine.Fred Dukes the Blob but not the comic version can punch a launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all, but a simple headbutt from Wolverines metal noggin is enough to daze him?Cyclops optic beams which instead of being concussive force are now more akin to lasers can burn through buildings but when fired at Sabertooth directly it simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging his clothes. Adamantium trench coats anyone?The gravity defying mutant Gambit, instead of utilizing his signature cards, is made into some sort of crazy acrobat. In one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by Wolverine...then amazingly enough a few minutes later he is on a rooftop running TOWARDS Wolverine. How he regained consciousness, ran away a few blocks, climbed up a building, then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match is a mystery yet to be explained.Some have excused this films weakness by claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash. The idea that this movie being a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrect.The comic book source material, the REAL origin of Wolverine...is a story worth bringing to the screen. It does not sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless CGI junkies. It is a well crafted story and although retold and readjusted over time, began with WEAPON X by Barry WindsorSmith.

This film should serve as a lesson to all past, present and future film makers...when you have a film as successful as the original Corpse Grinders was you should probably leave sleeping dogs lie and you should definitely not try to revitalize it over twenty years later unless you have the financial backing to pull of a superior sequel such as Herschel Gordon Lewis did with Blood Feast 2 All U can Eat Even if you do decide to do this you should probably spend a little bit more money than you did on the original and for gods sake...NEVER film a movie onto video...why do film makers even attempt to do this when everyone knows the quality is going to turn out hideous...I personally have yet to see one film made in this fashion that is even worth the powder to blow it to hell...if you cannot afford to make a sequel that is better than your original film then sell the rights of the film to someone who can...and what was Ted V Mikels thinking about or smoking when he wrote this godawful script?

The plot is pretty much a mixture of nonsensical business dealings among people who grind corpses into cat food while cat aliens, who are losing a war with dog aliens, looking to get some of this cat food. Watching this movie, I began to look for any kind of distraction, anything to reassure myself that I was doing something else besides losing my mind from the inside out.Several scenes go on for far too long, as characters take forever to do simple things. I have heard that Mr. Mikels does not like to use jump cuts too often, fearful that they will confuse his audience. I am not sure if this attitude is avantgarde or just stupid. Try as I might, I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters in the unnecessarily huge cast, well with the possible exception of the old men who are the caretakers of the factory. The majority of the cast are a bunch of notalent amateurs who do not even bother to learn the lyrics to Amazing Grace before they have to sing it on camera. Although perhaps the blame should go to the poor sound quality, since I only actually heard around 80 of the dialogue while watching the DVD.This is quite possibly the worst film to ever be shot. I have listened to snippets of the commentary,and Mr. Mikels comes off as a surprisingly sweet old man, what the hell was he doing making this kind of trash? I would like to hear the explanations from the old men who had to lie shirtless on a metal conveyor belt waiting to be ground up. Movies I have long hated suddenly seem a lot better.

In years to come the role of these films would be taken over by TV shows like Gunsmoke, Bonanza, etc  and these actually did the job better. Randolph Scott, looking particularly grizzled in this, is the good guy, struggling against the bad guys against whom he will eventually prevail. There is no more interest in what he goes through emotionally than in what his horse is feeling, unless you count wondering whether he will sort out the initial misunderstanding with the female lead by the end. The music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the characters than the acting is.

I have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made. Several times I felt like turning it off, and finally I did, halfway through, something I hardly ever do.Scott seemed unusually oily in charming the girls, his two sidekicks were annoying and so was the Mexican bandit lad.

The directing is pedestrian, and only accentuates how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it. I have seen plenty of thoroughly enjoyable soundstage productions before, but this is not one of them. All it does is make you appreciate the gritty ScottBoetticher films all the more.Randolph Scott is tanned, trim, and shines that million dollar smile throughout. He is always a pleasure...even in the worst of his films. Aside from Scott, the other main reason I wanted to see this movie was due to how much I enjoyed Ms. Wymore in Errol Flynns movie, Rocky Mountian. In Man Behind the Gun, she is just as beautiful, and you can tell she is a good actress, but she was forced to say some pretty dumb lines, and the blocking she was given by the director was truly awful. I have only seen Phil Carey in Operation Pacific, and he plays the exact same character here...an arrogant paininthebutt you want to beat into unconsciousness. I guess it proves he is a good actor...he made me hate him. There are some lame attempts at comic relief that only detract from the film, in my opinion. Although there are many elements to knock, I must say that I found myself truly enjoying the two Spanish songs sung in the musical numbers...but that is not why we go to see Randolph Scott movies, right?There are definitely worse Scott films out there, and this one certainly is not unbearable, but it also certainly could not be deemed anything beyond mediocre.","label":0},{"index":10203,"txt":"A family traveling for their daughters softball league decide to take the scenic route and end up in the middle of nowhere.

Somehow, according to the plot, god is outraged that society has chosen to rid it is self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds. Yet this same god has no indignation for the acts of the killer. The lead character, an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman, ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsuccessfully save this convicted killer. In other threads of the underdeveloped plot Jesus comes back as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of God.

I would like to do that but Hou gives us nothing to feel in Cafe Lumiere beyond a bland photo essay of Life in Tokyo Circa 2003 and the flabbergasting observation that people are ships that pass in the night, no, make that trains that pass in the day, never connecting, each hurtling to its own destination, usually some variant of a dark tunnel or maybe a bridge if they are lucky. Yikes. Flowers of Shanghai is one of the most rarefied, technically accomplished and mesmerizing films of all time. How could the same director who created the opening shot of that film, which features about twelve actors conversing at machinegun speed for about ten straight minutes  an impossible directorial feat  get trapped making this laconic subJarmusch reality porn for two films in a row now? Millennium Mambo may be dead weight, but at least it has two great shots, shots that hint at Hous true calling as the film equivalent of Odilon Redon Those shots are the sex scene with the arrhythmically blinking lights and the opening shot of Shu Qi floating down a blue corridor. His M.O. while making Cafe Lumiere seems to have been to remove the two great shots from Millennium Mambo to make it more consistent. You be the judge if that sounds appealing. Hou does not need to refine  you cannot refine the limbo idea further than Flowers of Shanghai. He needs to expand, to bloat outwards, to release the inner expressionist and genrerevitalizer that is being squandered so senselessly on clich\u00e9d minimalism. It is time for him to do a liveaction remake of Akira or something. This kind of art film where the actors are supposed to be authentic because they are held facelessly in longshot and speak in monosyllables is now every last bit as safe, ghettoized and stagnant as the Hollywood action blockbuster.  What is the connection between reality and people who cannot talk? It seems to me that people in real life never stop jabbering.  Then again, considering that 2005 alone brought bigbudget movies as diverse and rich in ideas as Aeon Flux, The Island, and King Kong, it is now safe to say that even Michael Bay has surpassed Hou, and that is really sad.The good news is that, though Hou is in his 50s, it frankly feels to me as if he has not even begun. There are a couple moments in this film that show the promise is still there, such as a moody bit early on in the bookstore when the room dims to a bloody sunsetred while Hitoto talks about babies with the faces of goblins. But whatever fear is holding him back, however comfortable it is to make the same film over and over and be hailed by the gullible and pretentious as the savior of cinema, Hou, your time as the darling of the Rotterdam, Venice, Toronto, Berlin and whatever else film festivals is almost up and people are catching onto your ruse doublequick. Two words for you Atom Egoyan. Two more words, or maybe three Tsai MingLiang. You are now cribbing from both of these tedious frauds who are about to go up their own dark tunnels forever. Risk your shirt on a scifi epic, sell out, be reviled  but leave the social critiques to people that have no eye and no heart. Let your painterly talent express itself to the full.

One of the things he misses entirely is Ozus attention to character  we are not even introduced by Hou to his lead character a perfect blank page. There are no medium or close shots of his people.

Having now seen several of his landmark films such as 1949s Late Spring and 1953s Tokyo Story, I am convinced that Ozu had a particularly idiosyncratic gift of conveying the range of feelings arising from intergenerational conflict through elliptical narratives and subtle imagery. It is Taiwanese director Hou Hsiaohsiens keen aspiration to pay homage to Ozu on his centenary with this generally enervating 2003 film. Among with coscreenwriter Tienwen Chu, Hsiaohsien appears to get the visuals right but does not capture the requisite emotional weight that would have made the glacial pacing tolerable.The story concerns Y\u00f4ko, a young Japanese writer researching the life of mid20th century Taiwanese composer Jiang WenYe in Tokyo after coming back from Taiwan where she taught Japanese. After 25 drawnout minutes of character setup, she reveals to her father and stepmother that she is pregnant by one of her students in Taiwan. At the same time, Y\u00f4kos coffeehouse friend Hajime, who runs a used bookstore, has an obsession for trains and seems likely to be in love with her. Hsiaohsien connects this slim plot line with a series of shots held for inordinately lengthy takes as the frame composition changes. There are also long stretches of silence as well as an abundance of scenes featuring trains. While these techniques are consistent with Ozus style, Hsiaohsien cannot seem to dive into the characters psyches the way Ozu did with maximal fluidity and minimal theatrics, in particular, Y\u00f4kos plight seems rather noncommittal in the scheme of the drama presented and her parents reaction overly passive to hold much interest. In fact, the whole film has an atmosphere of exhaustion about it, which makes the film feel interminable.The performances are unobtrusive though hardly memorable. Jpop music star Yo Hitoto brings a natural ease to Y\u00f4ko, while Tadanobu Asano is something of a cipher as Hajime. The rest of the characters barely register, even Nenji Kobayashi and Kimiko Yo as Y\u00f4kos parents. Cinematographer Lee PingBing provides expert work though he violates a cardinal rule of Ozu films by not keeping the camera stable during shots. Hitoto speaksings the fetching pop song used over he ending credits, HitoShian. The DVD includes an hour long, Frenchmade documentary, M\u00e9tro Lumi\u00e8re, which actually does help provide some of the context for Hsiaohsiens approach to the film. It includes excerpts from Ozus films, in particular, Equinox Flower, to show the parallels with this film though surprisingly no mention of either Tokyo Story or Early Summer, the obvious basis for some of the scenes and situation setups. There are also edited interview clips of Hitoto, Asano and Hsiaohsien, as well as the films trailer.","label":0},{"index":10224,"txt":"While the acting and directing could be argued as having some merit  the storyline is a very poor wannabe Vietnam movie with the country name simply changed.At the very least, for a movie to hold some credibility, try and have some semblance of accuracy in equipment, weapons and tactics.

What is really amazing is that there were some actual professionals who were involved in this glop.

The science here was  to say the least  a bit rough around the edges thus science fiction, with the emphasis on the fiction but somehow Rukh harnesses some sort of ray from Andromeda that allows him to look at the earth several thousand million years ago. In that pre historic time, a huge meteorite slammed into Africa, leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call Radium X  which can heal and destroy. A large portion of the movie is set rather tediously in Africa, on a search for the meteorite deposits, which Rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon, unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well.Karloff and Lugosi were both pretty good here. Lugosi pulls off a role in which he is the good guy pretty well, although I frankly found him a bit unconvincing  especially during the scenes set in Africa. The story also plodded along a bit, and while it held my attention it did not captivate me.

Romero and Stephen King Creepshow 2. This time there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories is really original or distinguished either. The first story is a horror staple, formulaic story about a wooden Indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners. The effects are really neat in this story, but it is just too familiar to be compelling enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the elderly store owners. The second story, The Raft, is a Stephen King story. It is about four teenagers that unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon the kids are screaming for their lives as a watery blob does each of them in for no apparent reason. However, instead of being suspenseful, the kids are saddled with bad dialog and dopeyheaded behavior, preventing us from really caring about what happens next. There is also some unintentional humor in this segment. The third and final story is The Hitchhiker, which is actually a retread readapted for Creepshow 2. The original story, by Lucille Fletcher, was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film. Then it was adapted for a famous Twilight Zone episode featuring Inger Stevens. The Hitchhiker works the best out of these three offerings, but it is not without its problems either. Lois Chiles plays a cheating spouse, who ends up running over a hitchhiker, or so she thinks. However, we do not know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her. As in many average stories of this type, the characters exist merely to tell the stories with their twists and turns.

It even amplifies the flaws of its predecessor, which was often predictable and heavyhanded. Still, the first time around, there were enough thrills to make up for it is periodic lulls, resulting in an uneven but overall fairly entertaining effort. The sequel has few worthwhile moments, so the transparency of the stories are even more apparent. Once in a while, it delivers, but most of the time, it just lingers there.As in the original, all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just desserts. A wooden Indian comes to life, wreaking vengeance upon the killers of its owner. Teenagers are devoured by an aquatic monster. A hitchhiker returns from the dead to pursue a careless motorist. None of these premises are inherently bad in themselves, but they are utterly lacking in inspiration. There are few surprises and no scares. This a textbook example of unmotivated, bythenumbers filmmaking. It does not help that this cheaplooking movie suffers from a flat directorial style, although to be honest, there was not much to work with. In the end, the second story comes off best, but not by much. For the most part, the performances are okay at best. George Kennedy, as the illfated general store owner, does an adequate, if not particularly inspired job. Dorothy Lamour, on the other hand, is quite good as the guiltridden motorist, evoking sympathy for her plight despite the predictable, redundant material. However, most of the characters are pretty thin overall. One would think that Creepshow 2 would have turned out better. George Romero, who directed the original, returned to pen the screenplay, based on more of Stephen Kings stories. Makeup effects artist Tom Savini turns in some good, gory work. So why is the film a letdown? I guess Romero did not really want to make a second film, but was forced to do so for financial reasons. It was a decade of horror sequels, clones, ripoffs, and whatnot, so this one was certainly inevitable. I can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry, picking up his paycheck, and running off.

Any sequel following a Romero film that is not directed by Romero himself has got some large shoes to fill, mostly because of the Romero fans out there who think he is God. I did not care much for the first film and funny enough, I did not care much for the sequel. The film series had so much potential but it was shortlived because both films were less than stellar. The biggest problem with CREEPSHOW 2 was that it only had three stories excluding the inbetween story, and because the first story sucked beyond belief, it only left the chance for almost half of the movie to be really good. I saw CS 2 at the movies and the first segment was a real groaner. Anything dramatic with George I cannot act Kennedy is automatically doomed and the Indian Statue story was too hokey and simply did not belong in this sequel. So after a really trite and dull start, there were only two other stories left to reverse the fiasco of the aborted beginning and unfortunately the two other stories were not great enough for me to forget the first story. THE RAFT and THE HITCHHIKER are moderately successful, moderately because though the two other segments have their moments, they still sorta fall flat. The two last stories are basically stretched out for too long. It is not that I wanted the stories to happen at a dizzying pace and end fast, but both good ideas found within those stories were sorta nullified by the fact that they were slow and padded and eventually fell flat when the segments needed to be more energized, more erratic and with punchier endings. Also, if the two last stories had not been stretched out to pad the movie or had all three segments been more brief with better editing and direction, they could have added a much needed fourth story to the bunch. Having only three padded segments made for a boring feast.The acting and writing in both THE RAFT and THE HITCHHIKER segments are from awful to good. I like Lois Chiles in the last segment. It is probably her best moment on screen aside from her role as Bond Girl Holly Goodhead in MOONRAKER and in DEATH ON THE NILE. But even her role is difficult to understand at times because of the serviceable direction and the unfocused story. Are we supposed to hate her or sympathize with her? Are we supposed to sympathize with the annoying hitchhiker? If the hitchhikers body was found by other people on the road, what was he when he attacked Chiles? Was he a ghost or a zombie or what? How did the body eventually left the presence of the other people who found him dead in order to attack Chiles? The whole thing is not very clear, even for a supernatural story. And the ending is rather dull and uneventful.As for the infamous THE RAFT story, well, the acting is mostly on the awful side and none of the characters are sympathetic or interesting. The characters would have been more interesting had the actors played themselves. None of the actors are convincing in their specific roles. Paul Satterfield looks smarter than the dumb jock he is playing and the actress who plays his girlfriend is not very convincing as the typical bitchy slut. She seems too timid. The same could be said with the two others who play the plain teens. The idea of the killer oil slick is interesting and creepy but not well executed. There should have been a fifth character to the story, maybe a homeless man or a ranger who lurks around the lake and knows about the oil slick and could have been the watery monsters alter ego of sorts. As creepy as the oil slick is, it does not make for a compelling character. And the way the story ends, everything seems pointless. No punch to it whatsoever.Except for the few titillating aspects which always seems to make boring things worthwhile, seeing CREEPSHOW 2 at a theater was basically a waste of money and time.

And to think I was going into this expecting to like this one more. Five years after its predecessor, George Romero gets back on board the EC Comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for Steve Kings three stories. Though, the direction is handed off to Michael Gornick. The film mostly falters in that aspect with uneven brushes by Gornick. But most of the blame would have to go to Romeros dreadfully static and unbearably cringelike script especially in those dialogues streaming through the first and final story. Moralistic messages that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters simply took over the black humour. Oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rotten music score accompanying the picture. Loosely linking the three tales Old Chief Woodenhead, The Raft and The Hitchhiker together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia 80s animation form. I rather liked this segment and the wisecracking Creep character was a glowing light.  The first story Old Chief Woodenhead sees two elderly proprietors George Kennedy  Dorothy Lamour of a general store in a dying native community, Dead River. Get robbed and eventually killed by a couple of punks dying to live it up in Hollywood. In front of the store is a wooden statue of an Indian Chief that comes to live to avenge their deaths. Listen to George Kennedy waffle.. And waffle on for 10 minutes about how he is committed to his great community. What a nice touchy feely time. Well, just like Kennedys speeches, this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never makes good of a fine premise. The overbearing script is plain inane and the performances are suitably so. These two factors really added to my headache. When the Indian comes alive and turns avenger, the goons meet a very quick though grisly death in the proper fashion. The effects were commendably done, but what about that free flowing hair. How could Hollywood knock that lock of hair back? Ugh!  Second story The Raft follows a group of dope smoking and yahoo teens heading up to a secluded lake. After swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake, they get trapped on the platform because of an ominous looking creature lurking in the water. Now this is much better, MUCH better. What starts of as your basic teens run afoul turns into a mysteriously creepy setup that is full of tight and claustrophobic tension. And it does not even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful splatter. Quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense of humour too. The surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it. The performances from the nobodies are acceptable without making a huge mark. Gornicks direction sticks to the nasty and rather gooey side. While, the alarming music score on this occasion pressed the right chords. The sludgelike creature in the lake like many have mentioned looks like an icky black tarpaulin yeah you are reading that right! floating on the water.  Finally number three concludes with The Hitchhiker. A wealthy, but sexually lacking woman is on her way back home after being with her male gigolo, but she is is running late. Thinking of some ideas to explain for her lateness if needed, she skids off the road and accidentally hit is a hitchhiker. Instead of checking or getting help, she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband. Soon enough she is being terrorised by the mangled corpse of the dead hitchhiker.Not awful, but I really did not get into this laughably ludicrous exercise at all. Compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to tickle the funny bone instead. Lois Chiles was okay in the lead role, but that constant assuring and the little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and downright tired. The vivid makeup effects are welldisplayed and dripping with vision. When she hit is the hitchhiker that is when it becomes hectic, cheesy and overthetop in its execution. From there onwards we endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat and repeat\u0085 and repeat the line, Thanks for the ride lady! This happens every time she decides to run over him. Have a little courtesy for the dead darling. In all, the second short story The Raft and the unpleasantly, wellconceived effects is what lifts this extremely inferior sequel.","label":0},{"index":10240,"txt":"We have all been there, sitting with some friends watching a bad movie, laughing at how terribly it was made and how poor the acting was; eventually the credits roll and everyone looks around and says how is it possible such a movie was made? who paid money to have this script made into a feature film? Well Jigsaw is not that kind of film, instead of asking how this garbage was budgeted you wonder why the makers were shot out of a cannon into the sun. Yes, Jigsaw is quite possibly the worst movie ever made or conceived, this coming from a guy who has seen Campfire Stories and Fever Lake. The film starts out in some kind of college class, what kind of class I am unsure, but it is imagined to be an art class. Now these dorks have been given a final project by their idiot teacher, five of them are given pieces of a mannequin and told to design it in any way they see fit, and since there are only five pieces the other students in the class receive and automatic A, oddly enough there are only six students in this entire class so the one goth chic gets a free A, good for her! A week passes and the five students, plus teacher, plus one hillbilly husband meet in a bar to discuss their and complete their project, they put the pieces together, head, arms, legs and inform the others why they chose their specifics designs, now these creative geniuses used the week to their full advantage, one puts a saw blade in the left hand, the other gets a sawed off shotgun, the right leg gets a bunch of broken ceramic glued to it and the left some magazine clippings, the head is the worst getting a camera in the eye, ala Hellraiser 3, with some bottle rockets for a stylish mohawk. After they have all spilled their guts about their specifics designs the now drunk teacher says they are to burn the mannequin, now aptly named Jigsaw. Now up to this point it has been standard horrible movie fair, bad acting, dialog and everything else, but has still been pretty plausible, yet after Jigsaw catches fire things take a turn for the worst...Jigsaw comes alive.. How you ask? I have no idea, he just does because the writers could not think of a realistic way for two pounds worth of molded plastic to become alive Come on guys, a bolt of lighting, a traveling voodoo priest, anything could have worked. So once Jigsaw comes to life he uses his new abilities of walking very slow and stilted with the use of his molded fingers to wreak havoc. First he kills the cool guy with some barb wire, this guy who was about to get it on with a hot chic decides drinking ground beer off in the distance is more important than what is in front of him. With him gone Jigsaw shoots the sexy girl in the face and then gives an old man a heart attack with a slight twist of his head, he then saws up a nasty looking southern woman and then her hillbilly husband; Jigsaw then kills the nerdy guy with some headless deception. Did I mention Jigsaw was taking body parts off his victims to make a human version of himself? No! Well its not important they do not even show his macabre creation, they do not even show him steal away a torso from his poor creators Maybe he was trying to create the head detective from In Living Color. So after these five have been killed the teacher and the nerdy girl are all who is left, the teacher figures out that Jigsaw only needs a head to finish his masterpiece, since he is still uninterested in that torso thing. So being the coward he is the teacher ties up the girl as a sacrifice to Jigsaw who comes in only to go for the teacher with his electric buzz saw which is not even plugged in. That is where the freaking movie ends, we do not even get to see the teacher get killed or what happens to the girl, let alone an explanation why Jigsaw came to life or how he cleaned himself off after being burned. This movie is so shameful it has too be seen, it is only 71 minutes so it is a small part of your day; For the memories of a lifetime, Jigsaw, Jigsaw, Jigsaw. Thank you Total Recall!

There is a subplot regarding missing drug money, but it is just a throwaway. No chases, no cliffhanging sequences, and no suspense. Just some dull beatings and a lot of chat by boring characters.

Encouraging the Big Bang, a world come from evolution, instead of seeing the beauty of creation. The film depicts a theologian bringing some modern findings to the actor who plays Jesus in the Passion Play, who happily incorporates them in his play.The depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the Passion Play is performed in Montreal has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the Passion Play instead of showing his love for God through celibacy. More often than not the directors abhorrence of the Church is clearly visible.The director has tried to make a parallel between Jesus life and the Passion Play actors life. This is an admirable attempt, but depicting the Resurrection with the transplantation of the Passion Play actors organs in other bodies signifies how the director thinks about Jesus.My opinion is not important, Gods opinion is, but I would not want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before Jesus throne.","label":0},{"index":10250,"txt":"Well, Jesus of Montreal is basically an intelligent movie.

Why is this movie so incredibly boring? I do not know. It just is and so it is not recommendable.","label":0},{"index":10251,"txt":"This film really disappointed me. The acting is atrocious. Unbelievable. And it is about actors. The story is incredibly obvious A group of independent actors stage a Passion Play and, in turn, they start to live out the lives of the characters they play. I have been watching a lot of movies lately, thanks to Netflix, and this is the first one I have not watched all the way through in a long time. I felt I did not need to see the end; we all know the end of this story.For some, it seems, this modernization of the Gospels is either sacrilegious or enlightening. I cannot speak to any of this as I was not raised in the Christian church. That being said, I was raised in the US and I live in an increasingly Christian culture. I am curious enough about Jesus and about the modernization of the religion, for better or worse. I have not seen Mel Gibsons version, but I am guessing that those who liked that one will like this, except for the most conservative. I just wish this was a better film.Lots of these reviews praise Arcands direction and especially the cinematography. I liked neither. The film itself is rather prudish and preachy. I did not believe the characters personae and I was never involved with their on screen lives. The play within the play is very much dated and would not, I think, carry it is own weight in a real time production. But that is beside the point. What I really needed for this to work would have been stronger development of the characters and the plot to support the philosophical and theological questions the film would like to be about. And the musical choices are obvious and unoriginal.There were two examples of this that come easily to mind. Firstly, there is a reenactment of the parable of Jesus driving the money lenders from the temple the lead actor, who has fallen for the woman who will play Magdalene and who is also a model and dancer, becomes enraged that she must debase herself by auditioning for a commercial with a wicked producer and plenty of panting men in the audience with her pants off. He trashes the place and chases them all out. I guess this is the level that the film wishes to reach. The romance between these two is entirely arbitrary and not at all emotionally realized and the scene is played out like a highschool rendering of Death of a Salesman, i.e., not well. Please stop hitting me over the head with this highhanded significance. The other is the relationship between the other female lead and the priest who has asked them to do the play and who, eventually, turns against them and betrays them to the nowadayscorrupt Church. Why. Why does she sleep with this guy. It brings him so much pleasure and me so little pain. Ah, the saintly whore and the lovable old coot. It seems to be just enough for Arcand to signify but not worth the trouble to enrich and enliven these characters. They are going through the motions and I am reaching for the eject button.Feel free to write me off as bored, jaded or just not interested. Feel free to watch this movie and see the Passion, in all its beauty, sadness and inspiration, delivered as an amateurish and gimmicky charade.

God knows what Noonan thought he was doing, but being funny sure was not it. He seems to think that flapping his arms and legs a lot and staring dumbly at everyone and everything is the height of screen comedy; maybe for him it is, but not for the audience. I remember seeing this in the theaters when it came out. It was on the bottom of a double bill with a threeyearold Jeff Chandler western Pillars of the Sky, which was pretty good and a Three Stooges short Sappy Bullfighters, which was not, and about 20 minutes into this thing all the kids in the audience were throwing stuff at the screen; it was so staggeringly unfunny that it did not even measure up to the worst of the Three Stooges shorts. I stayed around for the end of it not that I wanted to, but my folks were not due to pick me up until after the movie ended, and by the time this mess was over, I was the only one in the theater. I saw it again about 15 or so years ago on cable one night, and stuck around to watch it to see if it was as bad as I remembered. It was worse. The only thing it had going for it was Julie Newmar, who was as smokingly hot as ever; other than her, this thing has absolutely NOTHING to recommend it. The two of them also play Japanese soldiers, and the way they do it makes Jerry Lewis infamous playing of Japanese characters as thicklensed, bucktoothed, gibbering mental defectives look benign by comparison. Marshall went on to host Hollywood Squares, and Noonan kept trying his hand at making movies, but most of them were almost as bad as this.

Additionally, the film is not really realistic. Liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing French Citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in French Hospitals. I watched this film on my big screen TV at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on. Eventually toward the end I fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his exlovers son. By that time I was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover, marriage of convenience and a nutty exlover. At times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them  either Ismael or primarily Nora. To the detriment of the audience, viewpoints keep changing from Nora and Ismael, her exlover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital. There probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed. The epilogue does not really wrap up many of the subplots and seems to want the viewer to believe Nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow balls chance in hell.

The first centers around Nora and her struggles with various men in her life, including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live. The other story involves a young man named Ismael, a violinist who finds himself placed  unfairly, he believes  in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party. After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile, these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that Ismael is a former lover of Noras and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier, tragic relationship.With a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining, Kings and Queen might have been a potent, engrossing drama about modern day relationships. It certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power, and the performances are, for the most part, complex and touching. But, taken as a whole, the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that, quite frankly, it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on. Even more distressing is the fact that, even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people, we really do not know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over. For instance, Noras father, on his deathbed, writes a withering diatribe against his daughters character that simply does not gibe with the woman we have been looking at for well over two hours. Nora is admittedly no Mother Theresa then, again, who is?, but she certainly does not deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father. Nora could be accused of being confused, indecisive, a bit selfabsorbed at times, but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place? I do not think so.Perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that I was unable to fathom. But my suspicion is that even writer Roger Bohbot and cowriterdirector Arnaud Desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here. This is a well acted, pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long, rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises, a journey that leaves him no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning.","label":0},{"index":10260,"txt":"Rois et Reine is a sprawling mess of a movie which will probably irritate as many viewers as it delights. It focuses by turns on exlovers Nora Emanuelle Devosand Ismael Mathieu Amalric as they each confront a major crisis in their now separate lives. While Noras story is played straight and is sombre in tone, Ismaels is played mainly for laughs, although it is not particularly funny. Noras crisis is triggered by the terminal illness of her father Louis Maurice Garrel, and Ismaels by his sudden incarceration in a mental hospital at the instigation of a mysterious third party. Ismael and Louis are just two of the males who have shaped Noras life, and in turn have been shaped by her, the most notable others being her now deceased first lover Pierre and their young son Elias. As events past and present are played out for the audience, and the exlovers become involved in each others lives once more, it gradually emerges that Noras personal take on her life story may be less reliable than first meets the eye.Cult director Arnaud Desplechin has fashioned a considerable oddity here, one which has garnered major plaudits in France. He wilfully eschews established narrative convention and develops the movie via a series of dramatic shifts in mood and tone. Had this approach been founded on a coherent unifying core idea or theme it might have worked, but it is not clear in the end what exactly Desplechins film is actually about. Heavyhanded allusions to Greek mythology and Freudian theory are evidently freighted with meaning but, at least for this unschooled moviegoer, remain less than helpful in illuminating and interpreting the lives of the characters. At other times the treatment lapses into kitsch but the use of the anodyne Moon River as the films theme tune suggests this is probably deliberate.Spoiler alert I suspect a major theme of the movie is the not very original observation that how we see ourselves can differ radically from how others see us or even how we think others see us. This idea is most obviously represented in the film by the violent death of Pierre and the revelation contained in Louis secret diary, but unfortunately both events seem entirely disconnected from what has otherwise been revealed to the audience of Pierre and Louis respective relationships with Nora. This seems a cheat on Desplechins part, as if he is thrusting the idea upon us in unmediated form rather than illustrating it more subtly in the natural course of the narrative. One or two darkly surreal touches imply the presence of an alternative but largely unconscious world of persons stripped frighteningly bare, but again these are felt more as pretentious intrusions of filmmaking technique rather than eruptions from a deeper reservoir of truth inherent in the story. In fact, for all its heavyhanded hints at depth, the characters are curiously undeveloped and unnuanced, as if they function more as ciphers for their creators many ideas about people rather than as real people in their own right. Much of the detail of their lives seems arbitrarily applied rather than organic. For example, Ismael, as we are constantly reminded, is a viola player, but more than two hours pass before we actually see or hear him play, and the effect of his chosen instrument or profession upon his personality is never elaborated. Hence, he may just as well be a marine biologist or a trapeze artist. Amalric brings a certain manic charm to the unhinged but ultimately sane Ismael, but I found Devos cloying and monotone which may be intentional, however as the elusive Nora. Meanwhile JeanPaul Roussillon as Ismaels father, Elsa Wolliaston as his psychoanalyst and Magalie Woch as the psychically wounded but defiant Sinologist he befriends in hospital make the biggest impact amongst the supporting actors. Catherine Deneuves in it, too, though her role is little more than a selfreferential cameo.Ultimately, Rois et Reine is very much an acquired taste. Should it fail to push your buttons, it is very likely that Desplechins undisciplined and florid approach will frustrate and exasperate even as you somehow keep watching.","label":0},{"index":10261,"txt":"I am sure this was one of those WOAH! attractions in 1982 when Epcot opened, but now it is just silly.

Instead, Anita and Me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable, as the English are almost an version of the Indian Untouchable caste, and this is underscored by a thinlyveiled series of attacks upon the films other community the English.I felt Anita and Me is a hatefilled, grievancebased piece of work.

The writing is predictable. Every possible cliche was dragged out and aired. In fact, I have trouble thinking of any crossculturalcrossgenerational devices that could have been used that were not. The characters were thin and cliched the eccentric nonconformist minister; the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman; the over weight, overbearing aunt; the pushy Indian parents; the working class neighbour; the wise profound grandmother; the motorbike riding thug. The script was weak, with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimentional racist white characters taken. And why it had to be set in the 70s apart from needing an excuse for a 70s soundtrack is a mystery. Possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979. I do not know.Even these things aside, good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity. Instead, the usual BBC comedy suspects were wheeled out to ham it up. Bend it like Beckham had far better comic acting and serious acting, in fact than this, with a virtually unknown cast.In summary, a lazy cliched script, over acted, in a dull predictable story.

Moreover, the portrayal of the films central relationship, between an Asian girl and her white friend, is insufficiently deep to justify the way that the movie is structured around it.

It does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood, and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict the main family experiences.Unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious strife, a conflict over a road construction project, the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man who lives in the woods, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the intricacies of local church politics, and on and on and on. And all of that does not even include the actual central plot, which is only about the hopes, dreams, and frustrations of two girls and their entire families at the turning point of their lives. I was actually shocked when I realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer and that so much movie got accomplished in 1.5 hours! Ultimately the movie is melodramatic, every plot point is predictable, major life altering events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later...and some of those events are extremely distasteful. Most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime in a totally predictable twist and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on. Similarly, a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another twist.

I am sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existance and are never to be found again! Suzanne Somers at the pinnacle of her career playing Chrissy on Threes Company plays a vacationer at Lakewood Manor. Constructions workers are installing a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturb an ants nest. Or should I say, a MANEATING ANTS NEST!! One of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants. One minute he is picking them off his clothes one by one, the next minute he is covered in them. The next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt.If you thought that was pretty farfetched, you should see Myrna Loy playing a wheelchair bound resident who gets airlifted out of the Manor via helicopter! I could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting airlifted out of the movie!The final scenes depict Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other, blowing through straws and covered in ants.That is basically the movie. There is really no disaster appeal or bigstar draw to the film. It was intended to be a grandscale television event at the time. Now, it is lucky if it gets dumped in a 400am timeslot on your local television station.If you want to catch Suzanne Somers at her best, then watch an episode of Threes Company.

Only you cannot really call it horror. There is zero suspense and no gruesome events. In other words this movie is pretty lame. It is not that it is really bad or something; it is just very boring. A construction site near a hotel uncovers a big nest of ants. Later on we learn that, probably due to different sorts of pesticides used in the past, their bite became poisonous. Some people get bitten and rushed to the hospital and it takes ages for the residents of the hospital to figure out what is going on. Robert Foxworth figures it out first and then you can see him go berserk with a digging machine for what seems like several hours. Then they flee in the house, waiting to get rescued. And, man, you should see all the efforts they make for rescuing them. I will not spoil too much, but at one point they even use a big helicopter. All the time when I was watching this, I sat there thinking Come on, people, you all got shoes on. Just run out of the building. I am sure a bunch of ants will not catch up with you. It is all pretty ridiculous.Of course, lots of closeups of crawling ants are shown throughout the whole movie. Ants in the garden. Ants in the garbage. Ants in the kitchen. Ants on the roof. Ants in the bedroom. Ants in the sink. And the best part Ants crawling on peoples faces while the actors are breathing through straws. But when you see groups of ants in wider shots, they indeed look like black rice the set designers glued to the wall.One small surprise came near the end.

Now, THE SAVAGE BEES, another humans vs insects TVmovie from 1976 was much better than this one. I even feel I have to go back and add a few points to its rating after having seen ANTS.

I think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby, but do not quote me on that. The most memorable ant attack for me in the whole flick was the first one involving the kid who falls into the swimming pool after being swarmed and of course Summers attack scene too.

The actors did not help matters. No chemistry. I guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason that such is an essential element of these stories. However, the writers did not work very hard to develop the chemistry. Sure, they are both attractive, but whether they are attractive to each other seemed to be an open question.The confidence Turners character shows in Sabatos developed far too quickly and for no particular reason.

He is Cassandra with just the crazy and all the prophetic skills of a magic eight ball. He appears to be right by random chance.The death scenes are comical.

Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time.

So there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama but then again, this movie is just not, because of focusing on cool production techniques and special effects an not giving the characters a moment to reflect and most of all forcing the story along the path where they want it to be and not paying attention to let the story breath and naturally evolve.

As for the movie itself, again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful. I could not see anything which we do not see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half. Yes, that scene says somethings about humanity, but it does not make the movie brilliant. The movie is entertaining mildly and exciting in some moments or scenes, but no more than that. As for the biggest flaw of the movie, it is visual effects. It was just shocking, I could not pull myself together for a while, because I had expected a realistic monster, because it is not one of the old Gojira movies, it was made in 2006, but it was not. It is like if you do not believe that there is a monster, you cannot care about. If you agree with me about this, I highly recommend you Cloverfield that is extremely realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting, but at least planned, there is an effort. Dramatically powerful critique. Some critics talk about it as if it is a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it is rather a drama than a thriller or action, but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful. I do not want to compare The Host with other monster movies, but I try to mean that The Host does not do something that other monster movies do not do.

The scenes with this beast roaming the land and capturing people ranged from good to jawdropping.SOCIAL COMMENTARY Much of the story takes place in the quarantine area as the doctors under orders from the government state that SARSlike disease is out there. In a nutshell, we get the familiar government coverup story. You know, I expect this Liberal paranoid mindset with Hollywood films always painting our government as corrupt, but it looks like the Koreans are copying the format, and it is very tedious. In here, it takes away from the excitement and suspense of this monster. It just drags the film down. The main family featured in the film has to watch from a distance while the young girl in their family, presumed dead, was hauled off by the creature.MORAL A typical do not pollute the water message because this is what can happen  a horrible mutated monster. This used to be the antinuclear bomb message from the 1950 when radiation caused giants ants, spiders, fish or whatever in those schlocky scifi films. Now its environmental issues that are the focus.THE HUMOR This was mostly stupid. I normally laugh at slapstick but this was not funny. I do not know if the Korean sense of humor is that pitiful, or the film was purposely trying to be ultracorny with a take on the old Godzilla movies. Let us hope it is the latter.TRANSFER  The video transfer was good. This was a sharplooking picture and sound was decent with a lot rearspeaker crowd noise. I watched this in Korean with the English subtitles. That might have been a mistake as the Korean guttural voice sounds got annoying after a half hour.OVERALL  This had a promise but turned out to be a big letdown and even boring in too many spots, which is inexcusable for a modernday monster film.

It goes past the point of realism and your left wondering if a Yank has raped the directors mother.The grieving scene was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts going downhill.Here we are introduced to the Olympic medallist Auntie and drunk Uncle who walk into the memorial and start blaming the father for his daughters death, then hitting him before they all start rolling around on the floor crying.

The youngest member of the Park family is snatched by the beast, and it is up to the rest of her family to find her, before she becomes the beasts latest meal.Firstly, I love monster movies Mutated bears, oversized alligators, packs of ravening Komodo dragons, the whole lot. Creature features are my favourite kind of Horror film. So, I really wanted to like The Host, but it was not to be. There were three major problems with itThe first can be seen with a quick look at it is IMDb pageGenre Action  Comedy  Drama  Fantasy  Horror  SciFi  ThrillerToo many damned genres. It took itself too seriously to be a comedy, and yet was too light hearted to have any real message though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement. Antipollution, antiAmerican or antigovernment. The drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mishmash with all the other styles.Secondly, after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film. The central family wander about looking for one of their own while the governments of Korea and America, apparently, do nothing. And that is it, they just wander about, occasionally hitting one another, presumably for a bit of comedy relief. This lack of action made my attention wander, and apparently it did the same for the director, as whole plot threads go unresolved a mystery plague invented by the evil Americans is completely forgotten about, and is never resolved.And lastly, the film is clumsily political. It paints the Americans as being stupid and evil, but gives us no American characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain. The opening scene has the most obvious stupid American vs wise Korean moment. With a Korean morgue assistant asking his boss, the coroner, not to pour chemicals into the Han river. The American coroner all but cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to carry on. As well as being racist, it is lazy filmmaking and there is no excuse for that.On the plus side, the monster is good, kind of a mix of The Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the movement effects are quite cool, and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun. There are also some nice shots in the film. Some of which remind me, strangely, of the way Firefly was filmed shuddering cameras, out of focus shots etc.There is also a nice scene at the end, where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the familys mobile food stall. It is nighttime and snow is falling, the streetlamp is giving out a cold light, but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it.Overall, I was really disappointed by this film. I would been looking forward to a decent creature flick, and instead I get some pseudopolitical,horrorcomedy lite. Looking at the comments on IMDb I cannot help but think that if this had been a US production it would have been slated. Just ecause it is a foreign flick does not mean it is any good. There have been some great movies out of Korea in recent years The vengeance trilogy and Brotherhood, for example, but this certainly is not one of them. For once I am in favour of a remake. Tighten up the directing, improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film. As it is, it is not worth a couple of hours of anyones time.","label":0},{"index":10284,"txt":"What this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie. Unfortunately with disjointed storytelling, frustrating plotholes, and contradictory scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly the greatest monster movie ever. Let us start with the good stuff comedy, acting and special effects. From the getgo, this movie starts off fast paced and cheeky. The opening scene  the monsters origin  is campy and quick, paying homage the the classic environmental disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters. The pacing is fast, which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action. With in the course of 10 minutes you get the why, where, and how of the beast and are ready for action. In this the movie delivers.After another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced the lazy son and his precocious little girl, kind grandfather, and talented sister aunt and, of course, the monster. The characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent, allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work. The monster it is self looks great alien yet familiar  kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid. The effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you see it is strings. Even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar, like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd, slipping on surfaces, crushing and eating those in it is path. When the monsters path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment, and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movies appeal begins to unravel.Following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity. Plotlines are introduced, then abandoned, characters change their position for no apparent reason, and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent, while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random. As for the comedy, let me say this I am willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural. I am not familiar with Korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation. However, as an Asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in Japan for the last 5 years still here I would like to think I have a better grasp on Asian humor than the average whiteguy. That being said there were many parts of the movie that I understood were supposed to be funny, but, to me, were not.  SPOILER For example after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral; everyone is mourning. A new character is introduced  a brother  and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another. They both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder. This competition is, at it is core, funny two brothers who dislike eachother so much they even compete at a funeral  it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in Asian comedy. This subtle slapstick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but, seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl.  END SPOILER Then come the plot holes. there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained, or, worse, are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end. Finding out an obstacle is not an obstacle can be a good thing for a character, but you would expect some comment to that nature. Instead the audience is barraged by moments of anticlimax when problems just are not there anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start. So I ask you why even bring it up in the first place? This was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems, and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other. Of course introducing new and greater problems is a timetested story telling tradition, but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead it was as if you get several stories, each only explained 20 of the way and, in the end, the parts never converge to complete the whole.Again, I am willing to accept that a lot of this might be cultural. Maybe its in Korean story telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy. Maybe it is normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on everypage, but never finishes one. Maybe it is OK to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis. Or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.","label":0},{"index":10285,"txt":"I really, really did not expect this type of a film outside of America.

Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves. It is admirable to read some of the comments by the more intelligent viewers out there. They were able to see the shoddy and ridiculous handling of this topic. Those of you who think this is great cinema display a disgusting amount of ignorance and you need to watch Happiness to open your minds to the true horrors of pedophilia.Do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or be molested by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even a relative? Hmm...I wonder. If they are going to make a film about international child slavery of whatever kind they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotionally involving instead of this buttonpushing crap. 110","label":0},{"index":10286,"txt":"For Daniel Auteuil, Queen Margot was much better.

The biggest disappointments were from Chris Menges CrissCross and A World Apart cannot even be compared with this one, and Goran Bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from Queen Margot for this movie Attention to the end of the film. If this was an American pop movie, I would not feel surprised at all; but for a European film with more independent actors and director, a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simpleminded and disappointing. There are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people. There are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone. And finally, there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys. Every character is shown in simple black and white terms the good versus the evil. Plus, from the very beginning, I could understand how the story would end. Is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse? I believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie.

I kept thinking that maybe in the NEXT scene things would gel... Alas...Those who like Gus Van Sants films  especially his later ones  will probably like this. Personally, I find van Sants films to be dull, pretentious and facile. Well, he was an executive producer for this film, so it is no surprise that the film could almost have been made by him  although personally I actually liked this better than van Sants latest efforts e.g. Elephant.Contrary to many here, I did not think the film was difficult to understand or disjointed, I thought that above all it is a film that wishes to portray a certain mood  the mood of an adolescent moving slowly into the adult world  but so slowly that the changes are barely visible if at all. But I feel that the problem with the film is that mood is not enough... and not only that, but that the mood painted here is, to my mind, incorrectly chosen for the story that is supposedly happening. The dreamlike quality, so closely linked to nature, is beautifully captured here, but it is a mood which belongs much more to a much younger child, one who really still does get totally caught up in watching nature unfold waves on a beach, grasses and flowers, spiders etc. The rhythm of the film reminds me of my summers when I was about eight or nine. There is a LANGUOR to the film that is in opposition to what SHOULD be a very tense time in an adolescent life. When you are caught up in a crush on someone  or being the object of bullying at school  you are anything BUT languorous! There are only two moments that truly worked for me in the film...SPOILERS HERE  first when Logan drops the groceries and his mother throws a bit of a fit. The frustrations of an adult dealing with a klutzy kid  especially with no father present  seemed real to me.The second, and ONLY part of the film with any tension to it, were the scenes where Leah Logans recreation of himself phones Rodeo and tries to seduce him into phonesex. The first reason I liked it is because the person who did the voiceover of Leah was the most convincing actor in the entire film. It made me think of Claire Danes from My SoCalled Life ...the voice even sounded like Claire. She and Rodeo had the only scenes that seemed totally believable between the kids. And what I especially liked was the fact that Rodeo only pretended to play along... it was perhaps the best moment in the film as  finally!  we got some character development.All in all, a somewhat misplaced effort... we will have to see what he does in his next film before we can really say much about the directors possible talents.

I never really could believe, for example, the creation of Leah and I think that most viewers would be utterly baffled by the conventional way in which her telephone calls were filmed.As the film stands, I am afraid it is one I cannot recommend at all. What I can never understand is why a film like THIS one is not remade by an enterprising filmmaker...instead of all the mediocre remakes of films that were superlatively good in the first release! All it needs is a good script, written by good writers, and I think this film could be easily turned into an unforgettable classic about an aspect of male comingofage that is rarely treated in drama. All the elements that were so tedious and seemed so recherche in the film the messages written on the boys belly, the Leah scenes, the televisionscreen fantasies could become rich if underpinned with a good STORYLINE.I see in quite a few comments that people are talking of this film as somehow being about a gay subject, and I think that is mistaken. Obviously, the crush depicted is that of a newly pubescent boy on an older adolescent boy, but the character of Logan is far too young to have settled on any particular sexual choices, and, indeed, in his depicted masturbation fantasies, we see all sorts of stimuli, sexual and nonsexual, as we would expect in a very young boy like him.

It is kind of like being handed a list of ingredients, with no directions on how to put them together into a finished product. From the start, character development and story development are lacking...unfortunately, many times in this monotonous drivel we are teased with bits of plot and we think AhhOK...finally we are going to find out something more about WHY this scene is going on...or...WHO this character is...or maybe we are finally going to get to know and appreciate this character more...or understand and get involved more with this intercharacter relationship...etc. But no such luck!

I do not mind imagery that does not mean anything, but these scenes just seemed irrelevant.My impression is that the director was trying to convey Logans inner monologue. I do not know what else would explain what was going on. Unfortunately, nothing I saw gave me any clue what Logan was thinking about, what his perspective was, or even his emotional state. All I could tell was that he was not particularly happy with his physical appearance, and that he had a crush on an older boy. I thought the ending signaled what the relationship between the boys had become, but not much else did. Purposely juxtaposing ambiguous scenes with those that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision.

I had watched some of the previous seasons of the Bachelor in passing; watching an episode or two and missing the next three or so. I find that the Bachelor is often appealing and intriguing, though its quality and morality are often lacking.On the Wings of Love details the journey taken by Jake, a 31 year old commercial pilot from Dallas, Texas, to find true love, as true a love as one can find in a seasonlong realitydrama dating show. Jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country. He begins to get to know them a bit, but it is mostly superficial; how well can you get to know someone in a few 5 minute conversations? Jake tries to make his true intentions known from the very beginning, at least to the audience. He noted that he does not just want love or a good time, but he wants a fianc\u00e9 or wife. We can only assume that he has made this clear to the women in the competition as well. If that is the case, it might explain, to a degree, some of the womens actions. The women are super competitive. While they do not even know Jake at all yet, they are still in it to win it no matter what the cost.Not only were the women competitive, but they were also confident and catty. Threats, backstabbing, and warnings of Watch out! all show that these women were not there for a good time either. Jake noted that he was not just looking for sex appeal, but looking for a connection. However, the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress Jake with said sex appeal. They arrived at the mansion in skimpy dresses \u0096 either lowcut or short.While some girls seemed to maintain their sense of decorum, others missed that memo altogether. One girl, Channy, noted that Jake was a good guy to whom she could be a naughty girl. She went on to say that Jake could land on her runway anytime. She got flack from the other girls for her provocative statement which showed their take on these situations.So, a reality dating show could not be that bad, could it? Besides the obvious issue of sexdriven attraction, there are other issues that mar this seemingly harmless show. Is this the right way to find a future mate; vying for someones attention by flaunting oneself to extreme proportions? Unfortunately, however, that is what America has reduced dating to these days pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the side.Another problem is the premature emotional attachment by which many of the girls bound themselves to Jake. A few girls in particular seemed to be overly attached. One girl said If I do not get that first impression rose it will kill me! As mentioned before, they do not even know him yet and she was talking about a specific rose, not just one of the 15 roses to keep from being eliminated.Michelle, in particular, seemed to have some issues with attachment to Jake. The other girls noticed it too. After one particular Michelle outburst, Vienna asserted that Michelle had a mental breakdown and we have only been here an hour. Michelle got the last rose of the evening on the first show \u0096 narrowly missing elimination \u0096 and was extremely emotional about it. The other girls thought it was simply ridiculous. Another girl also cried, but because she was eliminated.It began with Survivor, and from there it just took off \u0096 reality TV. It shows our entertainment interests as a country; if we were not watching the shows and giving them good ratings, the networks would not continue to run them. The only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of America is hooked. One thing is clear America in general loves reality TV and its ensuing trappings.This begs me to question why is it that we even like reality TV? What is it about it that draws us to it? Is it because we see the similarities to our own lives, or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others? Whatever it is that draws us to it, we should be careful of the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds.

At the very first the woman tell all Woman such as Amy  who had a lot of class about her commented that she had tried every scene aka the bar and club scene to meet a guy and it was not happening for her. Hey Amy, how about joining a club? getting a hobby? doing charity work? changing your job to one where you meet more guys? gees, all I know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner.Amy and many of the other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of meeting the perfect man. Clue to ladies he does not exist. There are, however, many great guys out there that would make great husbands, some who may be right for you! they may not earn six figures a year or be a JFK junior look alike, but they are great guys all the same. The shallowness of woman on this show is quite unbelievable. Im still a youngster, at was lead to believe that woman gradually grew out of their shallowness as they got older and more realistic about their future partner. This show is proving otherwise.Overall this show does a lot to confirm many stereotypes of how woman view men in society.

The director clearly is a fan of Hitchcock, and it is too bad that the film was not better executed, but in fact, it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction, including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention.

Well actually i do not know because if you allow yourself to be indulged by plagiarised versions of original movies, then perhaps you may find this movie astounding this movie being a plagiarised copy of i know what you did last summer. The first 30 minutes of the movie is based on a typical story setting; a bunch of socalled cool teenagers relishing their vacation in Florida and being themselves by behaving very much like the juveniles they are. The only insight we get at this point is the extent to which the director succeeded in illustrating a pretentious sense of adolescent decadence within the characters. The second half hour of the movie gains a little momentum and begins to illustrate a start to the no wherenear unprecedented killings. The third half hour of the movie will most definitely remain a mystery to me because i switched it off before i could further delude myself into thinking that the movie may still have something interesting and original left to show. As far as the story is concerned, it can easily be explained in a few lines. A bunch of teenagers go to Florida on vacation. While they are busy partying, they slowly and i mean SLOWLY begin to get killed because they know some sort of silly secret. The only thread to the killings is that all victims were matriculates of a common high school. One thing that did however amaze me about this movie, was how much betty im not sure about her name..the blonde character looks like reese witherspoon. Another thing that amazed me about the movie was that it made me jump from my seat a few times.

By the time the movie Do You Wanna Know A Secret is over it is never explained just what those two killings back in Connecticute has to do with the slaughter in Florida of some half dozen collage students a year later? other that the killer, at least in the murder of Beths boyfriend, wore the same silly Halloween outfit. At spring break in the Sunshine State the six students spend their vacation at a beach house and before you know it they start getting knocked off one at a time. Starting with computer geek Brad Clyton, Chad Allen, the killing even spill over into town with a number of people who have nothing to do with the targeted student including the police chief Gavin, Jack McGee, getting sliced open. The masked killer saves Beth for last in this weird ceremony at a deserted church, in what looks like the Florida Everglades. He then finally reveals who his is and what he intentions are which make as much sense as the movie does, none. Trying to scare it is audience all the movie does is confuse and bewilder it with a number of nottoo convincing slasher scenes. The most effective ones having the victim Oz Washington, Tom Jay Jones, survive at least three attempts on his life and ending up, together with Agent Sacker, the hero in the film. Oz also had a vicious cut on is foot from a large splinter of glass that almost cut it in half and crippled him but later he miraculously recovered, after getting arrested for a murder he did not commit, in fact he had it out two more time with the killer with him not as much as having a slight limp in his walk! It also made no sense at all why Oz and Beth went on their own to tack down and catch the killer instead of calling the police, with a cellphone that Oz had, instead? Beths boyfriend, who loses his head over her, in the movie Hank Ford, Joseph Lawrence, is also very unconvincing as well as the two girls at the beach house.They together with with Beth Oz end up being the killers victims and then somehow disappearing from sight! for a moment you did not know if they were really killed at all or if it was some kind of hallucination on Ozs or the local police part. Until the offthewall final scene where they popped up in the church.We also get an insight on a previous relationship between Tina and Hank with her, drunk and acting obnoxious, trying to get it on with Hank as Beth walks in without Hank and Tina even noticing her.

First, there are gaping plot holes. Second, very few of the Clist i do not even dare call them B actors can act worth a damn, so any scenes that have potential fail miserably. Third, the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult, leading to very few surprises for the audience.

I mean it had flaws and of course it would be laughable to release this in the theaters but still for a midnight popcorn flick, this movie is not half bad. It has some scares, and some really hot women I might add. Plus it shows off Joey Lawrences new beefy look though obviously even that has not won him any big Hollywood roles either......I feel bad for the man, he had such a career in the early and mid 90s with blossom, some Disney movies and the everlasting Lawrence brothers show.....Joey Lawrence was a bit player in the sitcom scene, but then like in a 360 degree turn, his career went south only doing low budget movies like this one.The movie also throws you off guard in, it makes you think between the crew, there really is a secret that someone knows, to only be disappointed in the end to find out the secret.

The plot is extremely ridiculous; the characters are insufferably dumb, the gorefactor is negligible and the whole thing is just plain boring! As you can derive from the title already, this film is mainly inspired by I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, as the events take place in a similar setting and the killers motivations are equally stupid. Why anyone would want to steal ideas from junk like IKWYDLS is a complete mystery to me, anyway. At least that film could depend on the precious rack of Jennifer Love Hewitt, whereas the girls in this junk are, apart from brainless, also terribly unattractive.

You really do not need to be a horrorexpert in order to quickly figure out which face hides behind the unspeakably ridiculous mask and the writers attempts to put you on the wrong track are downright embarrassing. Since the plot is so thin, most of the film is purely irrelevant padding, including the sub plots regarding the incompetent Floridian police force and the mysterious FBI inspector who seems to have a personal score to settle. The murder inexplicably happen off screen do not you hate it when that happens?, there is not even any gratuitous TA to enjoy and you better do not get me started on the quality of the dialogs.

Del TenneyThe Curse of the Living Corpse;I Eat Your Skin, of all people, executive produced, cowrote, and stars as a priest in a pivotal role whose relationship to the killer I guess means something to why he is psychotic. The revelation of the killer is awkwardly handled and ineffective, probably not surprising a soul who watches it. There are a lot of attempted jump scares, with one character popping out to frighten their friend, which could not even manufacture a few cheap thrills, because they are so calculated in such a tepid way. Most of the attacks occur offscreen with bleeding throat cuts..or poolsrepresenting the only real display of violence. The protracted finale, where the killer goes on and on with the actor desperately trying to make his villain as diabolical and demented as possible, is embarrassing and tenseless. There is not one single positive to derive from this clich\u00e9d and dull exercise with the pretty cast making little effort to rise past their onedimensional roles. And, for pity sake, they could have at least allowed us to see Joey Lawrence get decapitated or something for withstanding the misery of sitting through this junk heap for 90 agonizing minutes.Dorie Barton, as the heroine final girl, Beth Morgan, who the killer seems to be obsessed with, could not be more vacuous and uninteresting..oh, she was in rehab, and takes pills for her nightmares;such intriguing exposition. Chad Allen, cast against type as a very intimidating friend of the group..who happens to disappear from the film first, setting up the idea that he is the first victim, has a tough hill to climb with his role, so steep he eventually stumbles, rolling uncontrollably with no end in sight.

They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. At about the same time, Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king. So when Wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friendswhich greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime.I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywoodthe silent era through the 1940s.

For example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brothers film, DUCK SOUP, yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. At times, Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho, but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! In fact, he just seemed to prattle pointlessly. His only funny quality was that he looked goofysurely not enough reason to put him on film. Additionally, Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheesea piece of cheese that sang very poorly! A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as who is on first which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing.

I knew that who is on first had been around for many years and used by many teams, but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist.Once again, I have found yet another subpar film by this duo.

Many, many things. The editing tries too hard to look good, and does nothing but confuse the viewer whilst also supplying himher with a powerful headache. The plot is muddled and obviously prolonged from what started as a short story or film. The plot only makes for less than ten minutes of good story, and this is just stretched out painfully until it reached the minimum length for a feature film. We all know what happens to things when we stretch them, right? Exactly. They get thinner. In the end, the plot is just so paperthin that you might even miss it, if you are not paying attention, which is hard to do when watching this movie. The acting is not even slightly impressive. The characters are poorly written and dull, uninteresting. One of the worst things that are wrong with this film is that apparently, whoever was in charge of the scoresoundtrack had no idea what the movie was, or what it was supposed to be aboutnot that I blame him, I could not figure it out either. As a result, half of the music in the film does not fit the scenes at all. Also, what was with all the sexual undertones between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Naturally, this was in order to attract young males, but it was just so cheaply done. And did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film? On any conceivable level? At all? The two creepy guys did not seem to have anything to do with the film at all, they were just there in order to have some chase scenes. I doubt anyone would really enjoy a film so poorly put together and such a shameless and awful Hollywoodlike attempt at a somewhat interesting idea. But I digress. I recommend this to teenagers with low attention spans who do not mind a really bad horrorthriller as long as there is some sex and gore in italthough that may only be true for the Killer Cut, which I saw. 110","label":0},{"index":10341,"txt":"Having seen the hot Eliza Dushku in the pretty good Wrong Turn, I decided to pick this one up instead of Return of the Living Dead, of all movies.

There is simply nothing to recommend this movie, and I am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut. It did not even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer or Valentine or Urban Legend. It simply made no sense, held no excitement, had very little interesting acting or compelling writing. The release date was apparently put off numerous times for about a year running, and the reason is obvious. The whole movie comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly, to meaningless effect. Get Wrong Turn instead, if you want to see Dushku. I would like to see a movie with her and the superhot Elisabeth Harnoisbut I do not think even that would have made this movie watchable.

That is right, I said Sean, bear with meRight after the accident, Cassie lays in the hospital stuck in between life  death right up until the very end of the movie. This is where the dream part starts.The movie is called SOUL Survivors, right? Cassies mind and soul carries on after the accident interacting with the other souls Annie, Matt, Raven, the 2 weirdos and Jude along with images conjured up by her mind Sean, school and everything else around her. The souls continue doing what they were defined as Annie the ravegoing chick, the 2 weirdokillers from opening scene, Father Jude still helping people etc.We are then taken on a very long ride, shown lots of images many of which my GF and I still cannot tie in but it all boils down to it not being Cassies time to die.At the end, Cassie wakes up in the hospital after being dead for a while. Her family and Sean are there. This is reality again. She is OK.Then the director adds a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream snippet of her in the wheelchair being strangled.

Unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of the surgeons whore trying to pull Cassie Sagemiller back from the dead... but no, that does not seem to work.

It breeds confusion much more often than cohesion, as the story becomes jumbled, messy and incoherent near key points of the mystery predictable as it is.Horror fans who pick up a copy will have no idea they are in for a film that is more concerned with building an uneasy facade of reality than delivering a body count. Credit goes to Carpenter for attempting to create something beyond a derivative teen horror flick; too bad he is created a derivative psychological thriller.

I had heard that the movie contained some hot shower scene between Dushku  Sagemiller. As the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost I found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene  at least I would get something out of this. Then it comes the two girls get paint on their shirts, they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off. That is it. People thought this was hot? Soul Survivors is one of those dropdead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have ANY feelings at all toward it. It puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about. In the end it leaves us empty. Carpenters finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and that is probably the most lively part.

The script or the book must have been good  why else would Palance, Matheson, Boyle, or Heston agree to appear in this dud? But something went horribly wrong from the page to the screen. Summary Avoid. Not even bad enough to be sobadit isgood.","label":0},{"index":10370,"txt":"I picked this title up from a friend who had it sitting in his exhaustive DVDVideoLaserdisc collection, so luckily I did not personally have to pay for it. I had an inkling that it would be a bad film, but I KNOW what a truly bad film is after watching greats like Children Should not Play With Dead Things and The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became MixedUp Zombies, and now there is truly nothing that fazes me unless it is astoundingly bad.Solar Crisis is bad, but it does not reach that sweet spot of absolute pain that some movies are at.Anyway, the general plot is that the sun is about to unleash a huge solar flare towards the earth that will essentially destroy it. In order to counteract this imminent threat, humanity has assembled a spaceship and crew whose duty it is to fire an antimatter bomb which the opening describes as the biggest explosive ever into the sun, which through some convoluted scifi logic will cause the flare to shoot out at a different angle, leaving earth unharmed.Never mind that what I have just described to you sounds like a bad episode of the original Star Trek. Even with an ensemble cast Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle, and Jack Palance, Solar Crisis can barely manage that level of mediocrity, thanks to a plot that starts simple, yet becomes increasingly nonsensical as time wears on.The crowning achievement of this debacle of a movie is the addition of a villain character played by Boyle who insists on sabotaging the mission. Through means that are never explained, he sends an evil minion with an embarrassingly bad haircut to exercise some sort of vague electronic mind control over the space crews genetically engineered scientist, played by female lead Annabel Schofield. Why is he sabotaging the mission? Because by his moronic viewpoint, he believes the flare will not happen and that when it does not, he will become fabulously wealthy because he has dug his evil claws into the stock market. In effect, you have a villain with the most absurdly stupid motivation imaginable.The films plot becomes amazingly convoluted and develops very slowly, in time tapping the use of characters who have only vague or uselessly brief roles in the storyline. I could sit here and explain in detail precisely what happens to demonstrate the sheer inability of the screenwriter to make a plot that actually clicks or holds your attention, but I am sitting here writing this review on Microsoft Word and I know for a fact that this would take three pages, and I would only succeed in losing your interest. But then again, you would probably get the same effect from watching the film.Anyway, the film is miserably bogged down with exceedingly poor dialogue. Imagine if all that ever happened on the Star Trek Enterprise was that the characters spewed scifi jargon back and forth at eachother. Yes, I know, they already do that, but imagine if that is ALL they did, and that they used said jargon to set up vague and nearnonsensical scenes that produce no excitement, tension, or interest in the viewer whatsoever.This is best exemplified at the point when a character in a ZeroG environment screws a bolt back onto a metal box before proceeding to cry in agony for a couple of minutes before suddenly exploding. The script alludes previously to the character risking an explosion, but does not bother to give any solid answer as to why or how this occurs, nor why he cannot really escape. In totality, you have a sorry cross between the bizarre and the laughable.Then we have several scenes where dramatic buildup leads to nothing. Jack Palances performance is wasted on a character that serves only to drive the boy hero do not ask around the desert, before getting roughed up and killed by a bunch of suits. On his deathbed, Palance finally tells our boy hero his last name while wearing a horrible bruised makeup job that makes it look like somebody put a balloon under his eyeball, which he kept quiet about before. Colonel Travis J. Richards. The boy repeats it quietly after he expires, giving viewers the impression that the name is of some significance later on in the film. Perhaps Charlton Hestons grizzled admiral character knows him and the plot will advance thereby once his name is repeated. Something. Anything.Nope. Sorry. Any hopes you have will be dashed when this moment turns out only to be another of many pathetic, failed attempts at creating drama\u0097for a character so flat and hackneyed that it will forever be a stain on Palances career, just as those of the rest of the cast are similarly marred.Completing the film is a painfully abrupt ending featuring Schofield piloting the bomb into the center of the sun in an effort to redeem her deeds while under the villains spell, a climax which features another of the films considerably welldone visual effects sequences that, even for the visibly elaborate care put into them, still always manage to make the film look just as chintzy as it really is. The saddest part about this film is the obviously large budget, tragically wasted on a stinker of a script and a supporting cast behind Boyle, Heston, and Palance that manage to nail the coffin shut with pure overacting.Grade D","label":0},{"index":10371,"txt":"Oh the hilarity! Oh the joy! Another film that is so bad it is good! Or, so I thought. In actual fact, this one misses the so bad its good phase and goes, sadly, straight to the could have been so bad its good, but they screwed it up and made it plain bad.For a start its way too long. Cut half an hour and it might have been more endurable. Then put in such ludicrous plots as the man who is sabotaging the mission to save the Earth, because he has all the food stockpiled and he will be rich if the mission fails!. Duh!. Or the talking bomb plot device last seen in Dark Star. Guess what....just like in Dark Star, the bomb has a malfunction.....hmmmm. Add in a dash of we cannot act our way out of a kindergarten play and you have Solar Crisis in a nutshell.Light relief is to be had in the form of Jack Palance or Jack Pants, as we called him in this flick, whose sole purpose in the film is to drive a kid around the desert and telephone the kids dad to come pick him up....eventually. Between driving and phoning, Jack dispenses pointless drivel and leers and cackles a lot, but contributes little to the story, such as it is. In short, he is the best bit of the movie.My award for The Most Ironic Line Delivered StraightFaced goes to Charlton Heston, who, when meeting his eldest son for the first time in ages, comments that his son looks a little out of shape whilst he himself is standing there with his gut bulging over his waistband and in dire need of a Captain Kirk Corset.Also amusing is the bad guys top henchman, who has a bright white hairstyle that kept making me think of Andy Warhol, for some reason.Apart from these hilarities, there is little to recommend this movie. The ending is a sequence copied from but mercifully shorter than the end sequence from 2001.Tips for enjoying this movie more, if you are foolish enough to watch it, like I did1. Any time the bomb speaks, imagine it is called Tarquin Trust me, it works!2. Whenever Chuck Heston is on screen and about to speak, preempt him by reciting a line from Planet of the Apes such as Get your filthy paws off me! or similar.3. Whenever the female lead is looking stressed this is most of the time keep hoping against hope that she is having an aneurism and will die soon.4. During the interminable the ships broke again scenes, keep hoping the techengineer guys will spout a Scottyism like You cannae change the laws of physics! or some such crap.Other than that, do what it takes to get you through this one. I dozed off half way through and woke to realise I had not missed anything, nor had the plot laughable though it is advanced any. So do not worry about tuning out for a few, you will not miss anything.","label":0},{"index":10372,"txt":"When I had first heard of Solar Crisis then got a load of the cast, I wondered why I had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before. Then I saw it.Now I know.For a movie that encompasses outer space, the sun, vast deserts and sprawling metropolises, this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature; it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera will not have to pull too far back.And the effects, while good, are pretty underwhelming; we are talking about the imminent destruction of the planet Earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare. But other than shouting, sweating and a red glow about everything, there is no real feel of emergency.Do not get me started about the cast. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle, et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is anyones guess. Makes you wonder who elses condos are not paid for in Hollywood....And as far as the end goes.... Well, let us just say it is tense and intriguing but it is too little too late in an effort like this.

But no woman would do what was done here, even a woman before the womens movement of the 60s and 70s. About the only portion of the movie that you could believe in was that Germany would want to know where the landing would be. Ignore for the moment that the British had captured all the spies but even if they had not, they would not have let one roam around like this just to reassure the Germans that the landing would be at Calais. It is not one major thing that makes the movie not work. It is the culmination of all the things wrong that makes the movie fail. Bad directing, bad scripts, no attempt at authenticity at all all combine to just make the movie fall flat. Generally speaking spies should fade into the woodwork. The suspense comes in with the spy wondering if the information they have is valid or not and worrying about being detected. On this one that game was over from the start. This spy was doing anything but spying. Your only chance at getting something that has some credibility and instills some suspense may be to read the book.","label":0},{"index":10374,"txt":"To make a good movie you either need excellent actors or an excellent director. You need at least one of the two. In this Eye of the Needle we have none.I do not even remember the name of the director. He must not have done much in his career. I like very much Donald Sutherland but he absolutely cannot be the main actor in a movie. He falls short. Sutherland is excellent in a movie when he appears for not more than 15 minutes. I would say for instance that Sutherland was excellent in JFK of Oliver Stone when he talked to Kevin Costner on the bench of a park for 10 minutes nonstop without even taking a breath. Wonderful. But Sutherland being the principal actor in a movie is no good.Kate Nelligan? She is probably good for TV series. The DVD is awful. Terrible colors. Terrible light.

His southern drawl was ridiculous. I found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to roost. Brando, so great in previous films, was reduced here to a laughing stock. Tyrone Power, in Witness for the Prosecution, should have been nominated for best actor instead of Brando here.The film, dealing with racism, dealt with the U.S. governments attempt to avoid marriages between U.S. soldiers and Japanese women.Brando was stonefaced throughout the movie. His moving from antithese relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an Asian woman. His emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could espouse such new views.Only the lord knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki received supporting Oscars for their performances. Nothing about either performance was equally impressive. Umekis appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part. A better performance in this film was done by Miiko Taka, who did nicely as Brandos love interest. She showed great emotion as the antiAmerican who found love with the Brando character. Her face was etched with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother in World War 11. She realized that her dancing was not her way out of this existence that she was living.Martha Scott went from the Hebrew mother Yochobel in The Ten Commandments to the bigoted mother of Brandos love interest at first. Her performance together with the one of Ricardo Montalban was wasted. Patricia Owens, as Brandos first love, showed depth and conviction in her performance.","label":0},{"index":10377,"txt":"I am partly a fan of Miyazakis work. I say partly because most of his films fall into two categories brilliant, and boring. Sadly this film falls into the later category.This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazakis recent film Howls Moving Castle. An intriguing premise is set up, but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it.The first third of the film reveals the postapocalyptic world the story is set in, and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold. From then on things go down hill. The middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinlyveiled ecopropaganda, and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of Japanese animated films.Overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators. What is left is something which is visually stunning although sadly the version I saw was an Nthgeneration copy, with poor colour  which gives rise to the common myth that Nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying, but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused.","label":0},{"index":10378,"txt":"This is a review of the later English release by Disney, featuring Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart, and co. I really wanted this film to be good. Really, really. I am a huge fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier Miyazaki film, I was eager to see it. But I was shocked, shocked I say, at the quality of this film. Those later films boast wellcrafted plots, 3dimensional characters, and the best film music since...well...ever. This film just does not come close.Might as well start w the positive aspects, though. Like all Miyazaki films, this one is still very imaginative, with a bizarre fantasyscifi setting, in a postapocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. Nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time. though not as beautiful and fluid as Miyazakis later films And the English voice acting is quite well done.But this film...just...is not...good... The characters are all cardboard  from saccharine sweet little Nausicaa, to the ruthlessly evil Tolmekians, to everyone in between. Once you have seen each of them for 30 seconds, you have seen all there is. And the fact that the plot just ambles along does not help.Then there is the music... Now, Hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer, but Nausicaa does not do him justice. Half the music is 80s keyboards on overdrive, and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them. I highly suspect that Hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picture.But wait! There is a great message with this film, right?! Let us all save the environment! Too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer. There is a scene in which Nausicaa hugs a tree. No, really. I as not kidding.It makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is. But for some reason all the other reviews on IMDb seem to adore it. And when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you what is going on, that is lame.If you are the kind of person who worships anime, enjoys 80s music, and plants a tree every Arbor day, you will probably like this film.

The film suffers not merely from the miscasting of everyman Tom Hanks as an uncaring Yuppie, Kewpiedoll Melanie Griffith as a manipulative southern belle and Bruce Willis ?! as the darling of New Yorks literati. The most serious miscasting was in the directors chair. Robert Altman might have breathed life into these unlikeable characters and made them interesting, but Brian De Palma, for all of his visual sophistication, has never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience. The resulting film looks good but seems blah toward its subject of dehumanization in favor of status.

First, any comparisons between novel and film are purely superficial. They are two different animals.The novel is probably intended as a satire, but it arrives as a cross between tragedy and polemic instead. Any comedic elements such as those which later formed the stylistic basis of the film version are merely incidental to the authors uniformly cynical thrust. And lest the omnipresent white suit of the author fool you into thinking this is another Mark Twain, think again. A more apt literary precedent would be the spectre of Ambrose Bierce in a top hat and tails. Tom Wolfe is equal parts clown and hack, more celebrity than author, always looking for new grist for his selfabsorbed mill. It is therefore no wonder that the excellent production skills and direction lavished on the making of the film were doomed from the start. Unlike true satire, which translates very well into film, polemics are grounded not in universally accessible observations on some form or other of human behavior, but in a singleminded attack on specific people  whether real or fictional straw men  who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer. Any effort to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clean start, free of the writers influence or interference.Having said that, I too find fault with the casting. It is not merely that incompetents like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith fail to measure up, but that real talents like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham, and Morgan Freeman are either totally wasted or given roles that are mere caricatures.There is enough topical material here for a truly great film satire, but it fails to come even close.","label":0},{"index":10382,"txt":"The point of Wolfes original novel  indeed the point of the whole story  is that things take place because of a carefully calculated sense of expediency. The goal is survival within a particular kind of life style. The novel is full of malice. The only relationship that rings emotionally true is that between Sherman and his daughter, Campbell, and that is only touched upon. That aside, everyone is out for what he can get in the way of publicity, power, money or self aggrandizement.Wolfe was criticized for hitting every character and every social segment of New York City over the head. His response was a denial. After all, he lived in New York himself and belonged to a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations, exactly the qualifications one would want on his resume in order to deny that he disliked New Yorkers. Wolfe has a PhD in American Studies from Yale and is no dummy. Those supposed weaknesses are what made the novel memorable. Nobody was any good. And Sherman McCoy wound up broke, a professional protester for social justice. The movie throws all of that away and imposes a moral frame on the story that simply does not fit. Wolfe did his homework. The novel was rooted in reality. Every event was not only possible but thoroughly believable. Wolfe might have made a great cultural anthropologist  he knows how to get inside a system and record its details.Yes, any of us might have found ourselves, as Sherman and his mistress do, stuck in the South Bronx, threatened by a couple of black kids, and making a getaway after bumping into one of them. That scene is transferred neatly from print to celluloid. But after that scene the movie seems not to trust its audience and at times become frantic in its attempt to spell out its message, however nebulous the message is. Sherman might accidentally hit some kid and be arrested for it as he is in the novel, but he would not immediately upon his release from jail go back to his phenomenally expensive condo, take out a shotgun, and start shooting into the ceiling with it, as he does in the movee. In what is supposed to be a funny scene, ceiling plaster falls all over the party guests and they scurry away, shrieking. It simply would not have happened. The movie has left the novels unspeakably detailed reality in the dust. Wolfes sensibility, the work he put into capturing the real, has been lost. What we get instead is a noisy, fantastic, and silly scene that does not do anything except wake the audience up. Similar empty scenes follow, screaming out for Wolfes verisimilitude.The movie also fails because it thrusts a lot of sin and redemption into an entertaining story of moral nihilism. Here we see Don Juan in Hell at the opera. We get lectures on redemption from a poet with AIDs. We see a lot of guilt in Sherman. A black judge who preaches from the bench and gives one of those final speeches about how we all have to start behaving nicely again. A reporter who feels sorry for Sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb. And a happy ending in which Sherman gets off by breaking the law with an idiotic grin. The scene sits on the movie like a jesters cap on a circus elephants head. The movie not only makes points that are already trite and unoriginal, it overstates them, as if the audience were incapable of absorbing any subtleties.It is not the acting or the direction that is poor. The films not bad in those respects. And the photography is pretty good too, including two rather spectacular shots  the gargoyles of the Chrysler building and the landing of the Concorde. It is the script that is thoroughly botched.The first half of the movie, roughly, is okay in conception and execution. It keeps some of the little details from the novel. Sherman and Judys dog is named Marshall. Who the hell would name a dog Marshall? It loses its focus almost completely in the second half and on the whole is barely worth watching.Wolfes cynical redneck rightwingism may be offensive to a lot of people, but he is got the cojones to lay his percepts out.

Once is in the sight of Geraldo Rivera playing an obnoxious, arrogant and amoral TV tabloid journalist  which is funny only because he apparently does not realize he is playing himself.

The pomposity of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd. Yet, one must admit it is a noble effort. It does have a good, if poorly cast, band of actors, who try to make characters out of cardboard thin caricatures.

This makes me wonder if Kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else.Either that or he is simply bad. Most importantly where is the lightness?! From the very first scene, music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling, and this continues right through the movie. I think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie, this would make the story feel light however they have completely failed here. Instead the music manages to give everything that movie feel, in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them, so that everything actually feels heavy.Another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line making it more dramatic. In the movie we see Franz passing Tomas on the street, who is on his way to see Sabina. The introduction of this chance meetingpassing, which im sure did not happen in the book, gives Tomas story more significance than it does make it light.There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed, imo for the worst, however this might have been done because the book simply does not convert well into a movie, such is Kunderas style. This makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book AND movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film. A film which is as long as it is uncompelling. For those who have not read the book yet I recommend just reading that. For those who have, I have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stayclear warnings.","label":0},{"index":10398,"txt":" Contains Spoilers I did not like this movie at all.I found it amazingly boring and rather superficially made, irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed themes given that eventually we have to die, how should we approach life? In a light way, like Tomas; in a heavy way like Tereza; or should we find ways not to face that question, like Sabina? How much is fidelity important in a relationship? How much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones? How much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our Country?Unfortunately, I have not read Kunderas novel but after having being let down by the movie I certainly will I want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation which is my guess or if it was dull from the beginning.I disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece. I simply do not see the reasons why. What I see are many flaws, and a sample of them follows.1 The three main characters are thrown at you and it is very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices.2 The secondary characters are there just to fill the gaps but they do not add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary.3 I did not like how Tomas was impersonated. Nothing is good for him. He is so selfcentered and selfish. He is not human, in some sense. But when his selfconfidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone, I did not find the interpretation credible.4 It is very unlikely that an artist like Sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. On top of that, the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions, which sounds strange to me. a how can Tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer? b how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed?5 The fake accents of the English spoken by the actors are laughable. And I am not even mother tongue. Moreover, the letter that Sabina receives while in the US is written in Czech, which I found very inconsistent.6 Many comments praised the movie saying that Prague was beautifully rendered I guess that most of the movie was shot on location, so it is not difficult to give the movie a Eastern European feeling, and given the intrinsic beauty of Prague is not even difficult to make it look good.7 I found the ending sort of trivial. Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the countryside, far away from the temptations of the metropoly, distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living, detached from their professional lives, die in a car accident. But they die after having realized that they are happy, indeed. So what? Had they died unhappy, would the message of the movie have been different? I do not think so. I considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience.8 The only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you are left with nothing. You do not feel empathy, you do not relate to them, you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say.9 I hated the stop the music in the restaurant scene which some comments praised a lot. Why Sabina has got such a strong reaction? Why Franz agrees with her? I really do not see the point. The only thing you learn is that Sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality. That is it. What is so special and unique about it?After all these negative comments, let me point tout that there are two scenes that I liked a lot that is why I gave it a two.The Naked women Photoshoot, where the envy, the jealousy, and the insecurities of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented.The other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians. Tereza pictures, taken to let the world know about what is going on in Prague, are used to identify the people taking part to the riots. I found it quite original and Terezas sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed.Finally, there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally designed in such a way that Tomas types are going to like it and Tereza ones are going to hate it. If this is the case I strongly doubt it, though then my comment should be revised drastically.","label":0},{"index":10399,"txt":"If you are one of the people who finds According to Jim great television comedy, this is going to rock your world.

CostaGavras is a wellknown communist sympathizer and his movies are always biased. For example he presents the US actions as brutal and inhumane, while representing Tupamaros extremist activities as something positive.As it turned out it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of the Latin America that the US got involved.

Again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history!! After a while, he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital.

The cast is fairly mediocre in their performances.Still I give the film some points for its haunting theme song and nice filming locations. The makeup work of the late Stan Winston is pretty good too, but it does not get much of a showcase here. A missed opportunity for sure. Definitely one of the lesser mancreature flicks out there. 12 out of ","label":0},{"index":10423,"txt":"Unless the title is supposed to be some kind of spoiler for the wifes transformation the fiends! ruining it for us.

Eminently forgetable except for the bad, bad performances.","label":0},{"index":10424,"txt":"Really, the use of stock nature documentary of swarming bats employed by THE BAT PEOPLE is some of the most effective ever. There are shots of teeming bats hanging from the ceilings of caves, swarming bats flying out of caves or swirling about near the mouths of caves. That alone is enough to be unsettling Imagine all of them swarming after you? And they do indeed swarm in what should have been a showstopper sequence that happened at about the forty minute mark, a downright inappropriately hilarious sequence where a teeming swarm of bats seem to attack a police car, splattering across the windshield like bloody broken eggs. The problem is that this sequence happens about fifty minutes too late to save the film, most of which consists of one or more people running around, screaming, waving their arms about at jabbering excitedly about some poor goofball who managed to get bitten by a bat during his vacation.The fear is that he is coming down with rabies, which does indeed suck, so their vacation is ruined, as the plot synopsis on the top of THE BAT PEOPLEs reference page does indeed point out. So here is an effective summary of the movie A young couple goes on a romantic getaway which is ruined when the guy is bitten by a bat. They bravely try to stick it out but he starts raving, trying to convince those around him that it is a bit more involved than rabies, that he cannot control himself, and they everyone should KEEP AWAY.Now, when some one is frothing at the mouth, covered with sweat, eyes boggling about like one of the cheaper Muppets and screaming at you to GET AWAY FROM ME, you get away from him. You do not try to give him drugs, you do not try to tell him you love him, you give the guy his space, go home, and try that scenic getaway next year.But no, the people in this movie all behave like morons, insist on pushing the guy to his brink, and he flips out, mutates into a part man part bat type creature, and kills a bunch of nonessential secondary characters. Nothing wrong with that, but the movie forgets that it is a low budget Creature Feature and tries to be some sort of psychological study. Instead of a monster movie, we get lots of people running around trying to get this guy to take a chill pill, and eventually he runs off into the hills looking very much more human than he should have, people insist on trying to chase him down and pay the expected price.The main thing wrong with the movie is that this should have happened in the first fifteen or twenty minutes, thirty tops, and the movie should have been about the guy AFTER he had turned into a Bat Person, rather than about the journey there. It takes a good eighty minutes to really pick up steam on that front, with some interesting character sketches along the way involving the always entertaining Michael Pataki as a small town cop who is lost his moral edge, and the late Paul Carr as a physician friend who does not quite get the message.The movie is dreadfully boring, about fifteen minutes too long and missed the opportunity to be a nice, forgettable little Creature Feature about a mutant run amok like the Italian horror favorite RATMAN, which I watched today and was sadly inspired to try this one after seeing. Me and my bright ideas, though the scene with the cop car was a howler Too bad we could not have had another twenty minutes of that.310","label":0},{"index":10425,"txt":"The movie is just as fun as staring at the sun.Sheriff Pataki is a total retard that loves nothing better to do than sit on his fat rear making a smoke ring from his puffy cigars and drinking booze while the doctor acts like a zombie version of Nicholas Cage sucking up all that so called Blood which in reality seemed like Fruit Punch.Most of all the plotting seemed very horrid to even call this piece of crap a movie.The rest of the characters in this movie are total wastes of time, the ending was awful, the outlines were cheesy, and the scenes were terrible. What else more should I say to you viewers out there? My advice would be to get your Rabies shot if you have already watched the movie. This movie may give you the foam in the mouth if you did not get your uptodate shots.","label":0},{"index":10426,"txt":"A man wakes from a nightmare about bats. He and his wife go out into the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon. He seems to hear a strange noise, and she is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling across their picnic blanket. He wants to go on a tour of a cave, which has something to do with some kind of work he is doing, but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon. She relents. They go on the tour, but leave the group to make out. She falls down a slope, where she is disturbed by insects. He follows her. He hears the strange noise again, and seems to know a bat is approaching; one does, and gets in her hair. He fights it off her, and it attacks him, biting his forehead.They get out of the cave, but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort, he starts having seizures in which he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people. He becomes angry when this happens. He is unable to drink alcohol without spitting it out. His wife worries about rabies, and he starts a Pasteur treatment for that, but reacts violently to the injection.And then some people are killed. We see parts of the mans transformation into a bat person. It seems it is not just in his mind. Whether the bat bite causes these transformations is not clear, since he already was having some symptoms prior to the bite.While the title seems inappropriate, the implication at the end is that the same thing is happening to another person. Not a very good movie, but I liked the variety of the desert, cave, and skislope locations, and some of the weirder scenes.

Every once and a while the movie suddenly vanishes from the infamous list, depending on whether there are new movies with Paris Hilton in the lead or documentaries about American Idol stars, but it always reliably returns sooner or later. And why? Because, unlike the majority of crap in that list, The Bat People is a legitimate bad film and it deserves to be on there regardless of any media influences or internet buzz! This nearly is not the worst film ever made, since the basic concept definitely has a certain charm and ingenuity, but it is still indescribably difficult to sit through the whole thing. The script is incredibly boring, with absolutely unnecessary padding footage and gigantic gaps in continuity, and yet the main characters still remain total strangers throughout the entire film. Other than a sensible screenplay, the film also lacks spectacular killing sequences and the makeup effects \u0096 although courtesy of a young Stan Winston \u0096 are ludicrously inept and remain largely unseen until the end of the film. The films title is inaccurate, as people refers to a number in plural whereas the story actually just revolves on one Bat Person. Much more than Bruce Wayne, the real Batman plays in this movie and he as well has a genuine Batcave and a Batmobile a stolen ambulance! The plot introduces a young couple on their honeymoonweekend exploring caves. They wander off from a guided tour group and he gets bitten by a bat whilst trying to protect his wife from the animals vicious attack. Worried that he might be infected with rabies, he undergoes an intense treatment at the local hospital, but still this does not prevent him from slowly transforming into a bloodthirsty bat creature. He kills random people at night and toys around with the suspicious police sergeant whilst his loving wife is still vastly convinced the awkward behavior is exclusively due to allergic reactions to the rabies treatment. Sure, honey! The script never explains why a bat would attack people and how come John always changes back into a normal human being at the dawn of a new day instead of gradually turning into a permanent state of batguano. So basically, The Bat People is a variation on the good old werewolftheme, but obviously not a very interesting one. The concept showed a lot of potential, but somehow the sub plots center on whiny drunks and perverted Sheriffs instead of on ghastly monsters. Some of the settings and exterior filming locations look impressive, the misfit song playing during the credits is strangely catchy, there is a nice bit of gore during the climax finally! and main actress Marianne McAndrew is ravishing to look at though not to listen to.

Allens original play was tongueincheek, which is why it worked on Broadway and in Allens 1994 remake. The screenplay by R.S.

Making Gleasons wife an airhead in this version when she was a headstrong woman in the original is just one example of why this does not work.The acting is not much better. Gleason does the best he can with the material, but he cannot save this. Gleason was a comic genius , but also a fine actor as he demonstrated in The Hustler and Soldier in the Rain.

The script by Ron Oliver concentrates more on supernatural elements rather than cheap teen slasher themes, whether this was a good or bad decision will depend on your expectations I suppose. Personally I found these different elements did not really gel or work that well together at all. The whole film was far to slow to be really enjoyable, after the opening sequence where Mary Lou dies no one else is killed until the half hour mark  then the film plods along for another half an hour until Vicki is finally possessed  the film finally picks up momentum for the climax where an evil Mary Lou kills a whole one person at the prom before she is supposedly defeated, come on horror film fans you did expect that clich\u00e9d killer not dead  ready for a sequel ending did not you? Do not expect a hight body count, just five throughout the entire film  none particularly graphic although I did like the way Monica Beverley Hendry as Beverly Hendry tried to hide in a shower room locker which Mary Lou crushed  resulting in poor Monicas blood oozing out. The supernatural side of Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II is depicted by Vicki having lots of hallucinations for the first hour  Mary Lou controlling objects during the latter stages including a couple of creepy shots of a rocking horse which comes to life, the blackboard scene is quite good as well as it turns into water  zombie hands drag Vicki into it. The slasher side of Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II is not outstanding, I did like Mary Lou herself as she churns out the obligatory oneliners  she made for a good villain even if she did not get to kill enough people. Oh,  yes I did get the running homages to various other horror film directors with almost all of the characters sharing last names with one, this obviously adds nothing to the film but is a nice little touch I suppose. The acting is OK but the normally dependable Micheal Ironside looks lost  uninterested almost as if he is asking himself what he is doing in this  if he will ever work again. Forget about any gore, someone is hanged, there is a stabbing with a crucifix that happens off screen, someone is impaled with a neon light, a computer goes crazy  electrocutes someones face!?  Mary Lou bursts out of Vickis body at first as a rotting zombie which was quite a cool scene. There are some full frontal nudity shots in the girls shower as well, if that is your thing. To give it some credit Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II is OK to watch, has reasonable production values throughout  is generally well made. Overall I was disappointed by Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II, it was just too slow  ultimately uneventful to maintain my interest for nearly 100 minutes.

The additional stuff includes the 1951 feature Superman and the MoleMen. So I slapped it into the DVD player last night, and here are my findings.Some initial disappointment  I had not checked, and I think I had it mentally tagged as one of the Kirk Alyn serials. I am not a huge fan of George Reeves as Superman, and I had not seen anything other than the odd clip of Kirk Alyn  but hey ho, never mind.This black and white production runs for less than an hour. It has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of Reeves early TV series, a twoparter, put together for cinema release, although IMDb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first TV series. In any event, it is an odd choice for reasons I will get to later. I am of an age where I recall TV and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets, so there were no major surprises here. Even so, for a low budget movie, this one is REALLY low budget.The story concerns the small town of Silsby  population 1,430  which, puzzlingly, is also home to the worlds deepest oil well 6 miles. The story opens with the wells foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down. This conflicts with the arrival of Metropolis reporters Kent and Lane to report on the well, at the behest of the oil company. As Clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down, a couple of odd little guys small in stature, big in head, black in jumpsuit, and bushy in eyebrow emerge from the cappedoff drillshaft, and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces.A deep breath now, here is the remaining plot of the picture. The little guys scare some kids, so Jeff Corey playing the towns rampant xenophobe incites some pals to kill these creatures. Superman steps in moderately ineffectually and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital. Coreys pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed, but he escapes and legs it down the shaft. Corey incites a lynch mob despite the sheriff arresting him to hang the hospitalised MoleMan. Superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows. A total of 4 MoleMen emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at Jeff Corey I call this an Aargh! gun because its sole effect seems to be to make Corey go Aargh! and Superman saves him. He immediately changes his ways because of amazement at Superman saving him after the way he has behaved, the Molemen go back down the shaft. The end.Despite the film only being an hour long, there is an inordinate amount of creeping around, bewareing and pursuing  I have left out all the MoleMan 1 creeps from A to B, looking out to make sure noone is following him stuff. The MoleMen are never engaged in any way whatsoever  they have no dialogue  they just turn up, get persecuted, and go back. They do look a little creepy, but they are hardly the bugeyed monsters that the towns reaction implies.Reeves is quite a good Clark Kent  very much a hardnosed reporter, much more so than Phyllis Coates rather indifferent Lois Lane. But he is a terrible, terrible Superman. Not only does he not look the part at least his hair is dyed black in this, which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the TV episodes, the way he plays it is all wrong in my book. I am sure he was told to strike the pose which Superman does constantly, but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips, not fists on ribs. And he plays Superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher  he does not actually wag his finger in remonstration, but he may as well have done.And Superman does a huge amount of walking around I say a huge amount  he is not actually in it all that much, and a bit of running. He takes off and lands a couple of times, but is not seen in flight at any point. Oh, some bullets bounce off him, and he uses telescopic vision as Clark, but with no accompanying visual effect. In fact, visual effects are conspicuous by their absence, and the few which are present are not very good.I have tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time but even by those standards I think it is a pretty threadbare effort. Thankfully, production standards on the TV series were higher, and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them.Something of a disappointment  I shall not be watching it again.","label":0},{"index":10455,"txt":"and not in a funtowatch way. it is just bad. it is shocking that people have posted positive things about it here. the story sucks, the acting is bad, it is not scary, the special effects are not specialoh no! the blackboard has hands coming out of it! oh geethe mirror turned into water! the hair, clothes and makeup in the 50s scenes are not accurate, and they got a middleaged man with a receding hairline to play the highschool version of himself. this is like lateron nightmare on elm street stuff. i enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror movie as much as anyone else, but there are better bad ones out there to choose from.","label":0},{"index":10456,"txt":"Mary Lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957.Well, the movie mainly takes place in 1986.

Oh the darkness of the dark, dark forest! or something else so unthreatening.

I suppose it follows cheaply along the lines of every slasher movie you have ever seen. It has the usual isolated place, the cocky campers, heading off to the wilderness. Granted, there are some pretty intense scenes. It is just so dull. Bad editing and the whole works. There are ghost children who sound like they are talking into a wastebasket. I am not really sure what rules the ghosts and the psycho with the seed cap are playing by. It also has the gross out scene where a man eats a piece of meat which is actually what is left of his wife. A friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of gratuitous, sick violence. I fear that it is just another step in our desensitized evolution.

He played the male child ghost in this B horror horrible, but I remember him from his character Freddy on the Silver Spoons television show. This flicks a major letdown. There is nothing here. It actually took me four months to watch it from start to finish. I kept stopping it in boredom, setting it aside and forgetting about it, then stumbling on it and trying once again to get through it. Obviously, the angle of this film that was intended to set it apart from its counterparts was the supernatural element, the apparitions. And obviously, here, that does not work. I cannot stand the male leads. I kept expecting them to look down at their palms during the longer dialogue scenes in order to read cheat lines. The situation at the beginning where the couples decide to go camping separately is awkward and plain dumb. I guess the only positive thing to say about this one is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg, you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh. It is fairly good gore makeup there. Man, I am really reaching for a positive now, huh.

The story is about two couples that hike into the forest on a camping trip. A cave dwelling, cannibalistic woodsmen and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon terrorize them. There is something you do not see every slasher. Director Don Jones gets an A for effort although the film itself falls flat on just about every level, the acting is just simply average except for Jeanette Kelly who plays the dead wife of the woodsman Michael Brody aka Gary Kent.The film opens with some beautiful shots of a couple hiking through a valley and into a forest. They realize too late that someone is stalking them. They are both dispatched in typical slasher fare. Our killer uses a trusty hunting knife throughout the entire film, except during a flashback when he implements a handsaw, pitchfork and rusty saw blade to dispatch his cheating wifes lover.The Forest has a good story line but the movie just does not work along with it I found it pretty boring with simply crappy acting. 410","label":0},{"index":10463,"txt":"A truly disturbed, cannibalistic psychopath, JohnGary Kent, under the pseudonym Michael Brody who lives in a cave, stalks campers who make the unfortunate mistake of backpacking in his wilderness. SteveDean Russelland his buddy CharlieJohn Batisget into a playful argument with their wives, SharonTomi Barrett, the late reallife wife of Gary Kent TeddiAnn Wilkinsonover surviving in the woods camping by themselves. To prove a point, the gals decide to head for the wilderness out of Los Angeles for a camping trip disturbing their partners to the point that they soon follow afterward. Falling prey to John, Teddi is soon killed as Sharon runs for her life as the men arrive late to the wilderness due to their trucks overheating. Afraid, tired, and paranoid, Sharon receives some very unusual assistance..Johns ghost children! That is right, Johns children remain in the wilderness, ghostly apparitions which spy on those who exist in the woods, taking a special liking to Sharon, helping guide her to safety and her friends. Meanwhile, Steve and Charlie soon find shelter from a down pour and the darkness of night in the very cave where John lives. Cooking over a burning fire, the meat simmering is actually from Charlies wife, Teddi! Unknowingly Charlie eats from the meat when offered by John who finds the outsiders inside his dwelling place! Anyway, soon, worried about their wives, Steve and Charlie set out to find them as morning breaks. Meanwhile, John goes a hunting, with Charlie, Steve, and Sharon in a fight for survival. When Steve suffers a compound fracture stumbling between two massive rocks over a flowing river, he will be handicapped only increasing such an already nightmare scenario, with Sharon following her ghostly young friends to potential safety..they even, at one point, plead with their father to not kill her. Charlie, unfortunately, does not have such friends.Director Donald Jones..who also wrote it and went broke funding the filmsmartly shoots the film in such a breathtaking, gorgeous location in the Sequoia National Park, in California, where those gargantuan trees tower to great heights, and I basically watch backwoods slashers for this very purpose. For some strange reason, I did not particularly find Jones direction of the setting very atmospheric..the dread was missing, although there are some rather disturbing attacks by John using his knife..shot in a clever way, Jones camera suggests more than what is actually on screen, yet, somehow, still achieves that gasp at what John is doing to victims. Within such a picturesque landscape, to see innocents preyed upon by a maniac, that kind of increases the terror. City folk attempting to spend a nice few days in a different place, to smell the clean, fresh air, enjoy the sights of a lovely view, only to find themselves stalked by a creepy predator with a very intimidating knife. Providing the backstory to why John is the monster he is, Jones allows us to witness his memory flashback in discovering his wifes adultery and reacting accordingly..she is also a ghost in the wilderness looking for her children, wishing to punish them for being naughtykilling both her and the lover in bed..a refrigerator repairman. The children, sad and depressed committed suicide and now haunt the wilderness, still interacting with their pa or whoever they so choose. I realize such a novelty as ghost children in a backwoods slasher is unique and appreciated by some, but I found the idea rather hokey and too silly to take serious. They do help our heroine escape a few potentially dangerous situations, but it was awfully hard for me to keep from giggling uncontrollably. The music I found hideously 80s and the performances are not mindblowing. I mean I could react to the situation they were in, because it is indeed quite terrifying to find yourselves in an unfamiliar and hostile territory being hunted by someone who knows the area so well. I think the film is similar in many ways to Do not GO INTO THE WOODS..ALONE!, except that THE FOREST has the aforementioned ghost children..their voices echo when talking to Sharon, their father, or each other. Gary Kent looks like a filthy George Lucas, with tattered clothes, and humanity lost. As I mentioned above, the violence is not as grisly as what is suggested because director Jones is able to effectively cut away from a great deal of knife penetration, yet the way he stages the set pieces leave you rather unsettled..such as Teddis murder, the violence mostly silhouetted on the surface of a nearby huge stone formation, her pleas for John to stop and, once stabbed several times, attempts to crawl away from her predator only to be finished off;a hanging corpse John is skinning. I have seen better and worse of this type of slasher film, it is rather mediocre, at best, with some effectively shot scenery. I do not really think it is particularly memorable, for the exception of the ghost children.","label":0},{"index":10464,"txt":"The movie starts with a pair of campers, a man and a woman presumably together, hiking alone in the vast wilderness. Sure enough the man hears something and it pangs him so much he goes to investigate it. Our killer greets him with a stab to the stomach. He then chases the girl and slashes her throat. The camera during the opening scene is from the point of view as the killer.We next meet our four main characters, two couples, one in which is on the rocks. The men joke about how the woman would never be able to handle camping alone at a double date, sparking the token blondes ambition to leave a week early. Unexpectedly, the men leave the same day and their car breaks down.. They end up arriving in the evening. When the men arrive, they are warned about people disappearing in the forest by a crazy Ralph doppleganger. They ignore the warning and venture into the blackening night and an eighties song plays in the background with lyrics about being murdered in the dark forest. The men get lost.In the next scene we realize that this is not just another The Burning clone, but a ghost story! The women, scared and lonely are huddling together by the fire. Two children appear in the shadows and decide to play peeping Tom. Well they are obviously ghosts by the way their voices echo! Their mother appears with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead and asks the two ladies if they have seen her children, before disappearing of course. The children run home to papa and tell him about the two beautiful ladies by the river. This causes quite a stir and he gets up, grabbing his knife from atop the fireplace. Daddys going hunting, The little girl, exclaims with bad acting. It is apparent here, that the dad is not a ghost like his children.Freaked out by something in the woods, the token blonde splits, running blindly into the night, carrying a knife. She encounters the father who explains he is starving and it will be quick. This does not make sense because of the panther growls we heard earlier Maybe he is allergic! Are panthers honestly even in California? She ends up wounding him slightly before getting stabbed in the head. A thunderstorm erupts and the men seek shelter, which turns out to be where papa resides. Clearly someone lives here because there is a fire and something weird is roasting over it. The children appear and warn them of papa, who shows up moments later. They disappear as soon as he arrives.For whatever reason, our killer only goes after females. He invites the men to have something to eat and tells us the story about his ex wife. We are given a flashback of his wife getting caught cheating. The old man does not tell them however that he kills her and her lover afterwards, but daydreams about it. We are not given the reason for the childrens demise. The men go to sleep and are left unharmed. The next morning the men discover the empty campground of their wives. After a brief discussion they split up. One is to stay at the campsite, while the other goes and gets help. The one that is going back to his car breaks his leg. We are then reunited with the children as they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who killed themselves from being sad about their mother. They agree to help the woman reunite with her friendsThe following scene defies the logic of the movie when papa kills the guy waiting at the campsite. He was also dating or married to the blonde. Somehow the children realize he is murdered and tell the woman about it. She decides to see it for herself and obviously runs into the killer. Luckily the children make him stop by threatening to leave him forever. You know where this is going.Overall the movie deserves four stars out of ten, and that is being generous. For all its misgivings, the musical score is well done. It is still watchable too. There are some camera angles that look professional, and some of the sets are done well. The plot is unbelievable. There is such a thing as willing suspension of disbelief, but with the toad 6 miles away; I cannot imagine the token blonde would take off like that in the middle of the night. I mean, come on!

Every once in a while, we would get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air Superman and the Mole Men. I always looked forward to those days. Watching it recently, I was surprised at just how bad it really was.It was not bad because of the special effects, or lack thereof. True, George Reeves Superman costume was pretty bad, the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible. And true, the Mole Mens costumes were even worse. What was supposed to be a furry covering would not have fooled a ten yearold, since the zippers, sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious. But these were forgivable shortcomings.No, what made it bad were the contrived plot devices. Time and again, Superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating. A lynch mob is searching for the creatures? Rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself, he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to Lois and the PR man. The creatures are cornered? Again, he stands around watching and talking but does not save them until they are shot. Luke Benson, the towns rabblerouser, shoots at him? Attempted murder to any reasonable person, but Superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems. Superman had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud, but never once took advantage of them.That said, both George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters well, seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles.

I love ultra low budget direct to home video or other alternative release horror. I love 80s hacker horror. I love backwoods slashers with fools wandering off into the night to be chased, murdered and eaten by psychopaths. I am all for the idea of nonprofessionals working on a horror movie as a way to maybe break into the industry or just making a movie because they want to make one. I am all for using found public locations, nonactors, no name talent behind the camera and in the studio. NO PROBLEM! The most evocative image from THE FOREST is it is opening shot of a couple walking in the distance across a forest into the woods We see them as tiny, vulnerable creatures entering a dank gloomy world where humans may not be the top of the food chain or most feared predator. Then the film takes a dive  never recovers  we briefly meet the backpacking couple just as they realize that they are being stalked. They get separated, both are butchered, and then we meet the movies protagonists as they drive their car in a traffic jam. They meet up with their respective mates and decide to take a camping trip. Sounds of snoring fill the room as people who came over to watch a movie fiddle with their cell phones text messaging people not there telling them how much the movie sucks.This film is too slow, this movie is too boring, and this movie is too talky. Which would not be such a bad thing if the writers had given the people something to say other than the most stupid, asinine and unnecessary things. You know your horror movie is in trouble when the character with the most interesting lines is the droopyfaced park ranger who warns everyone away from the Cannibal Woods. And speaking of these woods they look about as far away from civilization as the overgrown vacant lot behind the soccer fields, only with bigger rocks and a stream flowing through it. There are impressive shots of the forest primeval, but no real sense of being out in the middle of it. If any one of the characters just sat down on the trail and waited long enough someone would amble by.What is worse about the film is that it fails to generate any human interest I do not know who these couples are and do not care what happens to them. The hermit cannibal slasher guy is uninteresting even when pretending to saw freshly cooked meat off the leg of one of his victims to serve grisly bites to her boyfriend, who just happens to seek shelter in his cave. The irony of which is the epitome of underwhelming. Coupled with a deliberately ominous synthesizer music score, cinematography that suspiciously looks like someone strapped a camera on a dog and it follow peoples movements, a lack of appreciable gore, nudity, lurid thrills and unwholesome atmosphere and what we have here is a horror movie that is not even as frightening as a PBS educational TV show about how magnets work.I do not mean to dish it out to the people behind this film, since they obviously went into the project with next to nothing, did not push themselves to be creative and ended up with just another boring movie about some maggot chasing women through the woods with a knife. There is nothing wrong with that concept, what is wrong is the unimaginative and utterly pedestrian way this was executed, right down to the utterly pointless conclusion when the film simply peters out at about the 80 minute mark. The best thing that you can say about THE FOREST is that it is over relatively quickly and there is not much to command a repeat screening  Hence my confusion at why anyone would feel the need for a DVD release. It was fine as a Prism Video rental years oddity, as a DVD it will be 5.99 rack fare inside a month of hitting the shelves. There is little or no urgency to see the film, unless you are considering making your own ultra low budget backwoods hacker set in a public park where nobody can charge you money for filming there. Here is a guide of steps to avoid making.With all that said and done, the film did have one interesting sequence, or rather one sequence that was so pathetic and ineptly thought out that it becomes an enigma in an otherwise cut  dried film The madman comes home to find his wife in bed with the local contractor. He dispatches his beloved, arms himself with a kitchen knife that looks like it was made just to be used in a horror film and takes off after the interloper. The guy corners and attacks his quarry, who sidesteps  runs away, only to have the psycho materialize in his footsteps with a bigger, badder weapon. The psycho attacks again, and the guy gets away. The psycho materializes AGAIN, and once more the guy gets away. Then AGAIN! Finally on the fifth try the psycho trips the dude so to fall on some sort of a bladed contraption. How did he keep materializing armed with bigger badder weapons like that? Is there some supernatural element to this psycho? Since the film never makes it clear either way the scene is just an enigma, staged to build some tension. It is purpose remains unclear. The whole film is like that really, existing without any need to be made and executed in such a hamfisted, uninteresting manner that one cannot help but wonder what the point of it was.310, and ample evidence that just because you can release a movie on DVD that does not mean you necessarily should.","label":0},{"index":10468,"txt":"A cannibalistic backwoods killer is on the prowl and two bickering couples might be his next source of protein in this bargain basement Friday the 13thclone cheapie.

If nothing else, at least it obeys the, admittedly unwritten, first rule of 80s slasher kill someone within the first 10 minutes of playtime. Sure you have heard about the basic premise of this film a dozen times before, but do not let that discourage you from watching it, as The Forest has a couple of things more to offer than just an appealingly sinister cover image. It is actually a bit of an atypical 80s slasher! The main characters are not ordinary brainless teenagers and the script has solid ambitions towards supernaturalism. The concept is not always successful, let alone plausible, but it is more than interesting enough to hold your attention and there are even are a couple of surprisingly strong moments of tension and plot twists to enjoy. Two married couples decide to go camping in the most isolated woods of California, but due to a stupid bet the wives travel separately from their husbands. Barely set up for the night, they receive uncanny visits from a mother looking for her two children, the children themselves and finally the father who is out hunting for human flesh. The demented family may be real or imaginary, but the women are definitely in danger and by the time their husbands arrive, they have already vanished. The men too encounter the family, and they find out more about the slightly dysfunction background. The Forest is a weird and unusual film, to say the least. It is not exactly a masterpiece of plotting, but the thoroughly strange atmosphere will certainly appeal to openminded fans of 80s horror. The murders are fairly gruesome and willfilmed, including a slit throat and a painful sawmassacre, and the filming locations are stunningly beautiful. The more you contemplate about the story and its abrupt twists, the less it makes any sense, so my advice would just be to enjoy this odd viewing experience for as long as it lasts and not a minute longer.

It came across like a made for TV drama.I felt that the film was very contrived. The whole set up of hammering in the context at the start yes, we get that this is 80s Britain  you can stop now was tiresome, and gave a very onesided view of what life was like in 80s Britain  poverty, war juxtaposed with royalty, Margaret Thatcher, yet nothing in between? There were actually middleclasses who existed back then  just ordinary working people, with a decent wage and a mortgage. The Falklands clips also seemed to be added randomly towards the end, for dramatic effect, I presume.The sequence of events felt a tad disjointed, as the characters moved one one action to the next without us seeing how their mindset could have changed so quickly.The relationship between Shaun and Smell was toecurling. I could not even look during the snogging scene. I find it very hard to believe that she would have been attracted to a boy who was not only so much younger, but also looked so much younger. I know there were only four years between them, but four years is nothing once you reach your twenties, yet it is a huge difference in your teens! In my experience, that kind of teen age difference only occurs when the girl is the younger one, since girls mature so much quicker, and are more on the wavelength of boys a few years older. Sorry, but I did not buy it  an unnecessary plot point created for shock value.The ending was somewhat abrupt and, again, contrived. If the flag throwing incident was supposed to be iconic, then it fell somewhat short in my eyes.It bugs me that British films only concern themselves with either the upper classes or the povertystricken. Do not get me wrong, I love Trainspotting, and Four Weddings has its charms, but cannot we Brits come up with anything different? Why are our films always so hung up on the class system? I was born in 1973, so was not much different in age to Shaun would have been in 1983. I grew up in a single parent family on a fairly downtrodden council estate in a city in England. However, my childhood experiences were vastly different to those portrayed in the film  I do not even remember racism being an issue although i am not saying it did not exist. This is England? Not in my experience.The bottom line is that I felt this film lacked substance, and I was completely bored and unimpressed throughout.","label":0},{"index":10473,"txt":"90 minutes of Mindy...Mindy is a tease to boyfriend Bill...Mindy prances at the high school dance...Mindy hitchhikes to Big Sur, shoplifts a loaf of shepherds bread, Mindy nearly gets gangraped...

So, imagine that your older brother is Santa and then imagine how tough that must be. That is the premise here.Vince Vaughn plays the titular Fred, an embittered loser who spends a lot of his energy making sure that people do not go around expecting good things to happen to them or giving his brother, Santa played by Paul Giamatti, too much praise for simply being the limelighthogging, famehungry, slightly creepy guy that Fred would want to portray him as. Then, would not you know it, Fred needs a financial favour and so has to make up for it by helping his brother on the run up to Christmas. And hilarity and life lessons ensue.Well, that is what should happen. The reality is that we get a Christmas movie featuring a few good moments of Vaughns patented fasttalking, a ridiculously outofnowhere music video moment, Kevin Spacey playing an auditor out to close down Santas operation and he is one of the weakest baddies I have seen in some time, not enough of the gorgeous Elizabeth Banks in a lush Christmas outfit, too much of John Michael Higgins in his elf outfit to be fair, he is a highlight though and a movie that is too swimming in bitterness to feel like good seasonal fare yet too schmaltzy in it is latter half to feel like a fun poke at all the bad things about the commercialism of the time.Rachel Weisz is along for the ride too, as is Kathy Bates, but it is really nothing more than a movie for Vaughn and if you like his style you will find something to enjoy here. Unfortunately, there is very little else to recommend this seasonal stinker. Outside of Vaughns rantings the script barely throws up anything decent with the exception of one particularly good scene involving a hilarious support group dealing with a very specific problem.David Dobkins direction is as mediocre and staid as the 20p Christmas card that you send the auntie you have not seen in 10 years and he seems to think that simply putting the ingredients together without a good mix or decent care taken will guarantee a delicious Christmas pudding.

As if we already had enough SANTA CLAUSE movies three and gulp still counting, who wants to see a movie about his brother? In a plot that would be at home with Disneys SANTA CLAUSE franchise save the occasionally crude humor and Santas Little Helper wearing a short skirt, FRED CLAUS is a onejoke premise that goes on for 116 minutes. Sure, Jolly Ol Saint Nick has a brother, but where does it go from there? It is a shame really. FRED CLAUS is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable Christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow, but it would have been so much better than this. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we are led to believe he is really the long lost brother of the neveraging Santa Paul Giamatti, who invites his good ol brother to visit. Mrs. Claus Miranda Richardson is reluctant, and worse, an efficiency expert Kevin Spacey has come to keep a watchful eye on Father Christmas, and his THIS close to being shut down. Hah! And guess who plays Santas mother! Kathy Bates of course. Elizabeth Banks is Santas Helper Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves, and Rachel Wiesz plays Freds girlfriend! SI do not know if I would praise the casting or to bash it. Here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they are given way too little to work with.As for humor, the best that FRED CLAUS could possibly come up with is Santas brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a DJ elf. I have to admit I had a few giggles involving Fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers where he is joined by Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone, but the giggles begin and end there. Worse still, the movie even succumbs into sentimentality that is supposed to make us feel good and teach us a lesson about what Christmas really means.

But actually, that could be the least of ones concern as Fred Claus, boasting of having David Dobkin Shanghai Knights, The Wedding Crashers at the helm, contains virtually nary a genuinely funny moment as it clumsily treads the line between a boorish Vince Vaughn vehicle and a fuzzy Christmas film. In the end, it amounts to not much of both. And with a cast that comprises of Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz, and Kathy Bates, all the more it leaves one disappointed.Vaughn plays Fred, Nicks Giamatti older and estranged brother, who once upon a time, left him and their parents Bates and Trevor Peacock after having had enough of enduring his parents favoritism of his younger sibling. Nick grows up to be Santa Claus and as the voiceover tells us, time freezes on you and your family when you become a saint, while Fred becomes a Yuletidejaded repo man in Chicago who is having a hard time remembering his girlfriend Wandas Weisz birthday.He runs in trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother who eerily looks at least a decade older than him to bail him out of jail. Nick agrees but only if Fred agrees to help out on the toywrapping business up in the North Pole. Fred reluctantly agrees but his cynicism clashes with Santa and the elves perpetually cheery nature, even as an efficiency expert Spacey is checking on the toy factory operations, only too happy to have the whole Arctic operations shut down if things fail.The film, as said, does have its moments, but the padded running length stretches them thin across its duration. In between are piles of Christmas film clich\u00e9s that were handled better in, say, Elf and the attempts at sentimentality are as endearing as last years fruitcake.Vaugn, as usual, brings on his coarse charm to the table, but the neutered script of Dan Fogelman keeps him from REALLY doing his thing. Giamatti, underneath the bad fat suit, brings a jolly old charm to his iconic character, but unfortunately, has to play second fiddle to Fred. Spacey brings his game face, but his turns usually end as unfunnily vapid.Ultimately, Fred Claus becomes a forgettable film that falls below what those involved in it deserve.

After 30 minutes into the film, you would be in touch your inner scourge and say Bahumbag at how unfunny this film is and after another 30 minutes, you will want to walk out over how unbearable the film has gotten during that point. Out of all the actors involved in this mess, only Paul Giamatti and Rachel Weisz brings some life to there perspective paper thin roles and that is manly because they are both way too good of actors to be in this film. Paul Giamatti brings some depth and warmth to the character of Saint Nick himself but he is forced to Vaughns level of juvenile behavior when they are doing their sad sibling infighting. You can see in Giamatti face that he is not having fun with his role and it painfully shows in certain parts of the film. Rachel Weisz brings a sense of fun and spirit to her role but she really does not have much of a character to work with and you can see in her face that she is well aware of that, so much so that she seems irritated in certain parts of the film. Fortunately for her, she is not in the film much at all and is able to save some face, unlike Giamatti, who looks like he is about to fire his agent by the end of the movie. The direction also feels uninspiring, like there is no feeling or flow to be had and this is a supposed to be a holiday movie but it ends up feeling like you are just staring at a fancy widow display that is being torn down.I do not know what went wrong here but with only two actors involved Giamatti and Weisz trying their best to at least bring something to the table with a unfunny script they had to work with, spotty direction with no feeling for the subject at hand  and this is a Christmas movie of all things and a actor who just does not care about his performance Vaughn, you have a very unevenly bad film that is very painful to watch.","label":0},{"index":10495,"txt":"I just saw this film tonight and I have to say that it is a mess.

Of course Fred Vince Vaughn is the family screw up who comes home after a series of set backs that include his girlfriend Rachel Weisz in a cameo role dumping him, so he comes home to face his parents and his more successful brother Santa Claus Paul Giamatti and wacky high jinks follow with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of anarky as well that threatens all of Christmas. Now if you think you know the ending of this film, I think you would be right because it is predicable to the hill. As for the acting, Vince Vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays but this time he ends up more annoying than likable, Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus but the role is more than less one note, Elizabeth Banks plays Santas assistant but she is not much of a character at all other than a neurotic joke and poor Kevin Spacey ends up basically playing the same person he plays in the film Glengarry Glen Ross but a little more anal. The only two actors who come out of this film with their dignity intact is Paul Giamatti, who brings a real sincerity and warmed to his role as Santa Claus but he looks somewhat embarrass to be in the movie and you cannot blame him and Rachel Weisz, who manages to do a lot more with a very small role than most of the main actors do with theirs, which is a shame because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserved a lot better than what this script gave them.To put it in a nutshell, a major disappointment.","label":0},{"index":10496,"txt":"Alien Hunter 5 out of 10 Is it me or does every movie that starts in Roswell, New Mexico suck.

To make things worse the films pace is slow, there is almost no subplot, and the few action sequences are stereotypical and not that exciting. Its little wonder that this thing went straight to DVD. What is a wonder is why Spader  an excellent actor at times, who won the Cannes Best Actor award for Sex, Lies and Videotape, and did a splendid job in the innovative scifi flick Stargate  chose to sign onto this lackluster project. Or maybe not, if you look at his career, for it seems he has invested his talents in more misses than hits.The most remarkable thing about Alien Hunter is how they managed to cram in so many elements from so many great scifi films, and still have the thing turn out so listless and contrived. There are huge borrowed bits from The Thing both Howard Hawks original and John Carpenters excellent 1982 remake, Contact and Outbreak; a few hints of Alien, CE3K, The Andromeda Strain, Kubricks 2001 i.e. the alien black box and Mission To Mars i.e. the mystery message; and even a little dash of Sneakers and A Remarkable Mind although not scifi films, they share a cryptology connection. Hell, there is even cornfields and Antarctica, just like the recent X Files Movie. And the luminous translucent spaceship at the end looks exactly like something that was plucked from an outtake from The Abyss.Its all been done before and done a whole lot better, although I will admit there were a few mild surprises towards the end.

The mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on Antarctica. Julian Rome, a former SETIworker, is brought in to decipher the message. Problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his, and the situation quickly turns awkward, especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him. And the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly. Soon the object is in the open. The mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity. It is decided to open the object, but just before that is done, Julian decodes the signal. Do not open. But too late, and the object explodes as it is finally breached, and two things unleashed on earth. The first is an alien, that had been dormant in the object, and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff. And Washington, that is suspiciously updated on this historic event, decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth. So a Russian nuclear submarine, carrying nuclear weapons is sent to Antarctica.Comments The movie holds a few surprises. One is Carl Lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance, and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful, well worked through and a lot better than expected. Unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own, and this time not in a good way. Actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes. It is never really explained why Washington know so much, why Washington is able to command Russian submarines, why the object is in the Antarctic and has woken up now. It is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable English. Some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to Earth before and knew the language and obviously chose English, why?. But then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the Earth from the virus, send their Do not open message encoded!

What we do is, first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a Germanic accent, and we let him flounder around between French, German, American, and British for over 2 hours. Then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely, so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly. But just to make sure the viewer doesn\u00b4t fall asleep, we throw in details which are shockingly absurd, such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an altitude of 22,000 feet. Naturally, we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles, so we have every character, even the lowliest peasant in the forbidden closedoff city of Lhasa in 1943, speak perfect English, also with dubious accents. Of course, the trickiest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story, so what we do is this we have the Dalai Lama befriend the nowreformed Nazi because the latter is so good at fiddling with film projectors, radios, antique cars, and any other devices with represent the freedom of the capitalist west. In return, our hero learns from his young proteg\u00e9 a kind of vague, undefined Buddhism which is never really brought out or treated in a serious fashion. We also have lots of scenes with the hero flaunting all the marks of respects and protocol which the rest of the Tibetan society accords the Dalai Lama, even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound reverence for these people and their spiritual leader. In other words, we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a Buddhist, sort of, in his own way, even though we ourselves don\u00b4t seem to know what his transformation entails or how far we want it to go. And last but not least, we hang a statistic onto the end of the film about how appallingly the Chinese have treated the Tibetans which is certainly true, thus opening ourselves up to charges that we have made a political movie, even though it is nothing of the sort.

Unfortunately, the producers  writers forgot that Serling would build up sympathy for his characters before messing them over. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment.Framing story Adam West is... well, himself. He does not go the Bruce WayneBatman campy 60s route, but he rarely does.

Most of the actors are not too bad except for Josh Astin as Cassius, who manages to walk, talk and even breathe awkwardly, and the idea is mildly interesting. But like Abernathy, it does not go anywhere. The main character raises some relatively reasonable questions, bugs out a bit who would not?, and for some reason he ends up banished to a nuclear wasteland.Life Replay Not a bad little piece, and manages to predate both Click and Creepshow 3. I suppose it says something that people are fascinated by the magical properties of remote controls. The main character is mildly sympathetic. Nothing substantially innovative here, but it is okay.Fighting Spirit You see the twist coming a mile away but like the main character, it has some heart and it is a decent story of defeat and redemption.Finale So... why do people end up in cold storage in silver lame suits?

While there the driver accidentally hits a parked SUV  knocks out a headlight, but the girls all decide to just leave  not go find the driver. But the driver does come to find them, and it is not just that the headlight on her vehicle got dinged, it is for another reason that the girls do not yet understand. When the driver does first catch them she yes, it is a she brandishes a shot gun  makes them strip down, and keeps screaming at them, how much did you see?. Of course the girls are scared to death  do not know what she is talking about.As the night rolls on the girls end up in a cat and mouse game with the driver of the SUV, who manages to inflict all manner of injuries on the girls, who are remarkably resilient to shot gun blasts and screwdrivers where they did not want them. Eventually they come to find that something happened back at that store after they left that is the reason for this womans psychotic rage. And eventually they have a chance at revenge and take it about as far as they can go.There are elements of this film that are rather disturbing and scary, but unfortunately, those moments are undermined by bad acting, bad dialog, and huge lapses of credibility. One girl is hit by a shot gun blast and appears to be mortally wounded, and she is feeling cold, her life is passing before her eyes, but she got better? And how far can a minivan run on an almost empty gas tank at speeds of 80 miles per hour? I need one of those things, it apparently gets GREAT mileage.There should have been an ending when the girls got their revenge, but the film goes on for a bit after that, which is an anticlimax, but they at least learn some of what set the woman off, and the driver is still worried about messing up her moms van, which is obviously the least of anyones worries.So this is not the worst film I have seen, but it is too amateur to be good and yet a bit too scary and gruesome at times to be completely terrible.

Shaken  shocked the girls think their ordeal is over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as she seems intent on killing the terrified girls who are lost  are low on gas...Produced  directed by Greg Swinson  Ryan Theissen with Swinson writing the thing  Theissen responsible for the cinematography  editing I have to say that Five Across the Eyes is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen if not the worst, I mean I am struggling to think of a film I have seen that is worse. Now let me start off by saying that I am sure a lot of the filmmaking decision taken here were deliberate to try  provoke atmosphere, tension, realism  suspense but there is not one aspect of Five Across the Eyes that I did not hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that has been put up on YouTube  even then it is still slightly embarrassing  a frankly worthless waste of 90 odd minutes of my time that I could have been doing something more entertaining  fun like pulling my fingernails out with pliers. The reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the IMDb the amount of 1 Star comments is revealing  they cannot all be wrong, right?  it is message board which I think is much more of an indicator of what the average person thinks it is absolutely trashed by just about everyone  the phrase the worst film I have ever seen is used a few times  to be fair most of these negative comments mention th same things  I have to agree with them. The story is terrible, alright I suspect it is meant to be minimalistic but this minimal? There is never any reason or explanation for the events that happen  it just feels totally random. It goes on for ages, the amount of plot here would struggle to fill a thirty minute made for telly program let along a full length feature. The dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who do not seem to have a brain cell between them taking about random stuff  screaming a lot. Oh god the screaming, there are seemingly endless scenes of these girls screaming or crying or whining which not only irritates  annoys  prevents any sane viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impossible to hear properly. Then there is the real killer, the entire film is set  shot within the confines of a mini van, seriously the camera never leaves this car  as you can imagine it gets really boring, add that the low body count of just one person killed on screen  Five Across the Eyes is a film that I hated with a passion.On a technical level again I can see that the filmmaking style here was a deliberate choice but I have to be honest again  say Five Across the Eyes is the worst looking film I have ever seen. As a fan of film I like my films to look like proper films as it is a visual medium  I definitely do not want them to look worse than the average YouTube video or my home films shot on a camcorder while I was drunk. It really does look that amateurish  that bad, it is a complete eyesore  I hated every moment of every second of it. Just think The Blair Witch Project 1999 only ten times worse looking  sounding  you will be almost there. There are times during Five Across the Eyes when you literally cannot tell what is going on or happening because of the camerawork  the almost pitch black  grainy contrast levels. The violence is tame too with a few splashes of blood  a stabbing at the end.Low budget does not even begin to describe Five Across the Eyes, with a supposed budget of about 4,000 this is easily one of the lowest budgeted films ever given a wide release. The two vans in the film were owned by members of the production  that is basically pretty much the entire budget right there, the locations. The acting is pretty bad by the main cast, I just hated all the fake put on crying  screaming that did not convince at all but did irritate immensely.Five Across the Eyes will go down as one of the worst films I have ever seen  I have seen a few films, whenever anyone now asks me what is the worst film I have ever seen Five Across the Eyes will definitely get a mention.

A group of five teenage girls are driving home one night when they find themselves being pursued by a crazed female driver who wants to kill them. Two minutes into the movie, and the characters are already arguing and this does not stop. All we have for 90 minutes is a bunch of girls whining, crying, screaming, acting and arguing. None of the dialogue is even remotely interesting too, so you do not get to really know these characters or enjoy them.The acting was terrible and I was shocked to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers. None of these women looked a day under 20, and one of them easily looked like she was nearly 30 years old. At least get people who look the age. None of them gave even remotely decent performances, and just seemed like they were picked off the street or were friends of the director with no acting abilities. The actress who played the killer overdone it, but she at least showed something that the other girls did not  a little bit of talent.The characters do not help things because these girls are a bunch of whiny, stupid bitches. That is all I can really say about them, and it did not help that they ALL survived. If I have to go into detail, in one scene the girls are being chased by the killer and having their car knocked a lot. One girl injures herself and is whining about it...four of them are not wearing seatbelts...what do you expect? One of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killer...and you all just happen to be conveniently too hurt to help? Whatever.The filming of the movie is absolutely terrible. I do not care if this movie had a budget the size of a peanut, the filming was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie. The cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls, pushed up against a window somewhere and the amount of times the camera blurred out, shook and brushed up against an actress was horrendous. It was also grainy, and at times you could not hear what characters were saying not that it was anything worth listening to.Supposedly the killers car in the movie that supposedly got hit, even though we only heard the accident is actually the directors car in real life. No wonder they did not show the car getting hit! This movie is so cheap, they cannot even show a car getting a little scratched up. Oh, gotta mention the soundtrack also...if that is what it was. It was horrid...sad one second, then hard rock the next.

From start to finish the film is plagued with amateurish acting resonating from a very poor script, god only knows why the writers thought dialogue such as No do not go out there; do not go out there she will get you if she gets you she will kill you and if she kills you you are dead is of movie quality.This film displays very little character development and to be honest I could not care less about what pain and torture was inflicted upon them as they are just a group of ditsy college girls who show almost no redeeming qualities. All they do is cry and whinge throughout the entire movie and if the girls are not crying their arguing; when they do converse the topics are completely random about dating boys or how one of the girls father was recently cremated appropriate subjects when you are being chased by a psychotic killer.The soundtrack is also abysmal exhibiting corny techno music during both the start and end credits although hearing the credit music knowing the end was nearing seemed like heaven.The camerawork is appalling and at times makes the film unwatchable. I am guessing due to having little or no budget the director was limited to just one digital camera which resides in the girls car almost the entire movie. I think this was an effort to stick the audience as close to the action as possible to feel and experience what the girls are going through. But due to a very shaky camera, grainy picture and being too close to the action it can be hard to tell what is going on during action scenes and is simply chaotic. It is one thing to make a film subjective but it is another to have action on the screen that an audience cannot decipher because of the poor cinematography.I understand that Five Across the Eyes is a low budget indie film but that does not excuse the extremely poor quality. There are no redeeming factors to this film bad acting, poor scripting, shoddy camerawork and no story. In light off all this I decided to give the film 1 out of 10 as it left me very disappointed; wanting a meteor to hit the earth bringing me sweet relief.

Firstly there is the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the The Simpsons Troy McClure should be doing the narration.Then the rest of the film begins starting off with a title song which really does not fit in with the rest of the film which, while technically OK, is killed by a vague, inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters, but characters that make no sense.This is especially so with Mickey Rooneys Spiventa, who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the organisation the whole time yet what would have happened had Hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out? In that case he would have been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character, which in the end he still is.The overall problem of the film is that it is totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy. It is as if the filmmakers did not have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions.Put simply, the film fails on all levels.","label":0},{"index":10533,"txt":"I am dumbfounded. Yes that is right. I am really caught here. No way did I find it awful, but on the other hand it was a frustrating experience in macabre hysterical and murky incoherency. The idea behind such a trim, minimal lowbudget Indie production is not bad, but it is a confused muddle and in the end did not do anything for me. It is amateurish and simple; it wants to exploit beyond reasoning and do so in that oflate fashionably rapid filming style. We have the documentary laced handheld camera moving everywhere despite never leaving the van, and sometimes feeling unfocused and blurry making certain details hard to figure out. Lately you kind of get use to it, but there are times when it does become too distracting and even nauseating. Keeping it still will help. The context has little groundwork which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads. At a roadside store they become involved in a minor accident which smashes an unoccupied SUV headlight. Scared, they flee and not too long that onelight SUV appears behind them. Soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror spending most of the time playing out a drawn out, noisy and relentless cat and mouse game. As for being disturbing\u0085 I guess that depends. Some moments can make you squirm with its attention to pain, desperation and demented brutality with good use of piercing sound FX that seem to be more favoured over the imagery and not forgetting the alienating background sound effects, but also I found myself snickering too. In passages it can be repellent and intense with a real gradual rush, but hardly believable. The injuries of random characters never seem as serious like you were to believe, despite obviously they should be. Watch how blood runs freely, but it is not entirely convincing and can get dull. The constant nocturnal car chase could only do so much before getting repetitive. We get screaming, spewing, bleeding, running, cursing, body fluids and so on. Quite unpleasant details followed too. With little really to do, it needed a much stronger script than the measly forced one that was penned up. Too many cringemoments arose from it, and there was not much in the way of depth for the characters and situation they were in. It was about setpieces, waiting for next torturous encounter and it drew it out long enough. Helping out is it had an unpredictable pattern. The performances; Jennifer Barnett, Angela Brunda, Danielle Lilley, Sandra Paduch and Mia Yi are workmanlike with their distraught characters and draw an authentic chemistry to make up for the scripts weaknesses in its characterfoundation . Veronica Garcias flippedout, bugeyed intensity as the loony driver of the SUV was something\u0085 yeah something. Her characters real motivation for terrorising the girls and her unstable state of mind is virtually nonexistent. I guess being psychotic was good enough. Now probably the most unnerving thing I came across in the feature was that hideous soundtrack. Terrible techno music, to cheesy hardrock and an overwrought closing score. It never felt overdone or got in the way, but it did stick out like a sore thumb. Codirectors Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen try to get the most out of their slight resources, but even with it edgy spirit it ends up being something quite ramshackle.

We had already been treated to one of the other women urinating over one of her friends at gunpoint, as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting; once would have sufficed... we got the message!

Sometimes we find a real gem, but many times we find that the film we have just spent our hard earned money on is nothing more than a putrid steamer made worse by the completely undeserved rave reviews and film fest awards listed on the box. Such is the case with Five Across the Eyes  a title I am sure is a double entendre referring to both the films budget and the compulsion anyone watching it might have to using all five fingers to stab their eyes out .The story, or, at least what the ahem writers think passes for one, centers on a group of teen girls who unwisely decide to go on a backwoods joyride late at night after leaving a football game and run afoul of a crazy woman who plays cat and mouse with them as punishment for what she thinks the girls found in her car after a fenderbender in a gas station parking lot.In fairness, it is an interesting idea. Some of the best horrors have very simple story lines. It is in the execution of Five Across the Eyes that this idea falls flat. The film tries to be a cross between The Blair Witch Project with its shaky camera work and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its barebones approach to the material but succeeds at being neither. What we get instead are redundant scenes of chase, torture, release; chase torture, release, in that order for 94 minutes with long interludes of bitching, moaning, and incoherent rambling acting as plenty of padding inbetween chase sequences.The look of the film is incredibly grainy and dark, which, in a better made film might have enhanced the tension and the realism. Here it is merely annoying. The characters are undeveloped and the viewer is hardpressed to find anything to sympathize with them. One character stops to get a firstaid kit and tend to some scrapes on her face while gunshots heard in the background indicate her friends may be getting killed. Another girl mutters hilariously dumb lines like Do not go out there, she will get you, if she gets you she will kill you and if she kills you you are dead.It was an accolade from Fangoria magazine and Dreadcentral.com listed on the box that compelled me to check this one out.

The characters are onedimensional caricatures save for LoveHewitt who manages to bring some cohesion to the film. Things threaten to spiral out of control in the plausibility department as the film progresses; our goodnatured suspension of belief finally comes crashing down during the preposterous ending.

And it works for that for that purpose being a British romantic comedy it is a bit more.The story is a rather simple one about a wife Alice Jennifer Love Hewitt married to an increasingly distant husband Sam Jimi Mistry who has put their love life on hold due to the burdens of his busy law practice. His partner Archie Dougray Scott is fond of both Sam and Alice, but has a longtime attraction to Alice that goes beyond friendship. Alice pals with her sister Felicity Kate Miles, a free love advocate, who encourages Alice to have affairs. On Valentines Day, after a drinking binge with her sister, Alice mails a card to Sam signed Anonymous as a test to see if Sam responds, testing his fidelity. At the same time Archie mails a radish seed packet to Alice on which he has inscribed a suggestive love not. Both have ex post facto regrets. Sam in fact is spending time with a lover Katya Branka Katic and is indeed cheating on Alice. Alice arranges assignations with Sam via email and phone calls and plans to meet Sam in disguise as Anonymous to test his fidelity. The entire cast of characters gets caught up in the silly charade and the ending proves that real love must be based on truth  and how that results in the various pairings is the surprise of sorts of the fluffy script.British comedies work because of the quality of writing and the tight quality of acting. Perhaps had director John Hay elected to cast a British actress as Alice instead of pasting a phony accent on Jennifer Love Hewitt the result may have been improved. But in the end this story by Peter Bloore bounces between mildly humorous and pathetic in its messages. One terrible distraction is a musical score that is consistently so loud that it covers all the dialogue and is intrusive.

The defining moment in this movie is probably the scene in which Gary Sinise mocks The Karate Kid and debunks any notions that he is going to become a mentor to the adolescent golfer. It is refreshing, in a way, that this movie refuses to follow most of the simplistic and overworked movie formulas. However, too much of it still comes off as contrived. At the drop of a hat people drop all pretenses of civility, or fail to stick up for the things in which they believe, or are exposed for something far less respectable than their place in society assumes. Unfortunately, there is often no resolution to these moments. And except for the fact that the club serves as backdrop for them, there is no real continuity or linking of them.

The script loses the meat of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low brow gags.

Mason Gamble is great when given the opportunity, as is Dylan Baker, but the skeleton that remains of the story plays out like a bad after school special. Poor people  GOOD, Rich people  BAD.

Never the child.This movie further took a disastrous turn with, as the Australia poster stated, the person who molested the child in the movie was IN the situation trying to help the child.Had Melissa Gilbert never put her son IN that place, he would not have been molested, is what the movie says. He was better off under her supervision.If I turn my kid over to your organization for aid and he gets molested instead, do you think I am going to be keen to listen to anything you have to say after that? Not likely! I think it is a safe bet that all of these accusatory messages that these kids were typing out, that this movie was based on, they never accused someone within their operation as took place here.Unfortunately, I do recall that the movie gave a very good performance from Gilbert as the mother of an autistic, but other than that, the movie really did not do much.The worst by far was the child typing at the end to Patty Duke, and we hear the mechanical voice read back what he typed, . . . . . we won! This child was molested. If you cut my leg off and I take you to court and you are found guilty of damaging me, assault, whatever, then that is legal justice, but it does not bring my leg back.At best, in my condition, I will view it as a hollow victory.Whatever chance this child had at what is perceived as normalcy with the autism alone is further damaged by the molestation.A normal child has enough to contend with from such an experience.It is utterly superficial to think that you must look upon any situation and go we won if that person is found guilty in court.Just a bad handling of a situation and circumstances all the way around here.","label":0},{"index":10565,"txt":"I cannot believe they got the actors and actresses of that caliber to do this movie.

If the court had allowed him to testify that way, they would have brought in someone neutral otherwise they would be just asking for an appeal. Thirdly, this child was never asked specific questions about the defendant by the prosecutionbirthmarks, details of the event, etc. and even when asked by the defense specific questions like when it started, he could not answer.

It is as if the stilted discourse of 1950s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems, in consequence, a very distant country indeed; and therefore stresses the particular, rather than the universal, in the story.

Stupid Gangsters Who Cannot Shoot Straight !! From Dragon Dynasty comes the Hong Kong gangster drama, Dragon Heat. For reasons which will probably forever be completely obscured, the production and casting call for this criminalsonsteroids movie somehow got both Maggie Q and Michael Biehn to sign on as villains. But they do not get all that much to do in this horrid slugfest.They are two of the best contemporary actors around, each with their own resume and list of accomplishments, and Biehn in particular has had the courage to take some rather challenging and nonheroic roles.Maggie Q was the superbad Mai in Live Free Or Die Hard, so nuff said.Biehn is, of course, famous for being the soldierfromthefuture who made The Terminator of 1984 such a believable sciencefictionfantasy romp, by crashing up against Big Arnold, who is now the Governator of California !! Michael Biehn is almost wholly wasted in this terrible trainwreck of a police drama. There is absolutely no reason for that, as the incredibly convoluted plot  given mostly in Chinese, as it is a Hong Kong story  could have been better elaborated for nonChinese audiences with a foreign narrator.In other words, if Biehn had been used as something like an Interpol observer or coordinator, or an agent under deep cover, who needs to get some splaining given to him every five or ten minutes, that would have been great. But no, he is brought in as a part of an odd group of special forcestype bad guys who seem to be freelancing their own corrupt deal, in the middle of somebody elses totally corrupt deal involving the local king of corrupt deals.

Welcome to the party, pal.In the truly superb Hong Kong crime drama, known by its English title as Breaking News, there are also a number of fascinating characters at work, but there is only one story line in the plot. Bad guys vs. good cops. In this wretched and excessively violent foray into the world of a Hong Kong Triad, or gang, it seems that the hotshot police force is little more than a parade of ducks in a shooting gallery, the way the criminals mow them down.So, not surprisingly, there is an almost otherwise incomprehensible scene  several scenes, in fact , where kids are trying to shoot wooden ducks in an arcade game, to win stuffed animal prizes. And so the hot shot goodguy police officers quite naturally intervene on their behalf, so that the arcade owner has to give up the Kewpie dolls.There is also a halfhearted attempt at creating a love interest between one of the visiting cops and the sole female visiting cop.The visiting cops are supposed to be material witnesses against the Triad gangster leader, who gets hijacked on the way to his court appearance, but not by his own team but by the mercenaries  Biehn, Maggie Q, and some others . These killers all want something but we do not get to learn about what it is, until the very end of the film !! That was a stupid mistake inside of the overall story.You cannot build suspense in a crime drama without something to obtain, or get, or get away from, being introduced very early in the story.Add to that some cutaway scenes done for purely artsy effects, all showing the badbad guys and the regular bad guys recent pasts, and any film buff can readily understand why this barking dog gets a 1 rating from this fan of all things cinematic with criminals and conspirators and Hong Kong.","label":0},{"index":10579,"txt":"At the end of Dragon Heat, all I could think of was why I bothered sitting through the whole thing.The films premise is interesting and that  as well as Maggie Q  is what attracted me to the film in the first place.

Writerdirector Daniel Lee cannot hold a candle to the likes of John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen.This has to be one of the most annoyinglydirected films I have ever seen. Lee is so wrapped up in his visual style  and I use that phrase incredibly loosely  that he fills the film with completely needless blackandwhite stills, freeze frames, slowmotion, fastmotion and other visual nonsense. I suppose he did all that to make up for the lack of a good story or dialogue.The action scenes are nothing special and play out like some hoppedup music video more than anything else. There is little to care about any of the characters  including two supposedly professional snipers who could not hit the broad side of a barn from the inside!  who are then laden with some of the cheesiest dialogue I have seen in one of these Hong Kong actioners.The plot is devoid of any twists and turns  from the initial setup, everything unfolds in predictable fashion  and Lee feels the need to keep reminding us of the characters back stories in case we did not get it the first several times. This is awfully amateurish writing and filmmaking and wastes the talents of Sammo Hung, Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. Though, to be frank, I am hardpressed to remember Biehn being in any good film that was not directed by James Cameron.If you really are in the mood for a great Hong Kong actioner, you are much better off sticking to some of the staples  John Woos The Killer 1989 and HardBoiled 1992, Ringo Lams City on Fire 1987  which Quentin Tarantino stole for Reservoir Dogs 1992  or his Point Blank 1967 remake, Full Contact 1992.

Let us add to this Jessica Simpson, small town bimbo, that brother of Owen Wilson and for some no apparent reason Andy Dick only because of him you should ignore this film.Basic story lineBoy leaves girl for NY, girl follows, boy cheats, girl stays in NY with cousin, gets a job under false pretenses, mucks up, is courted by other boy Brother Wilson and together save the day and kiss.a few words come to mind when reflecting upon this film, i.e. dire, awful, unbearable, intolerable and xenophobicJust do not watch this film, you will be happier. One reviewer referred to Guantanamo and i definitely agree with him. This film induces shock. And I know what you are thinking... at least at some point will I see Simpson naked or close too. It is not gonna happen, spare yourself the time and YouTube her. You will have better sexy time!The films editing is flimsy, the acting is unbearable, and why do they use blue screens?In conclusion; this is cinematic treason which should be punished to the maximumAnother question why does Willie Nelson always play a kind of father figure in almost every Jessica Simpson flick and why are there no black, Latin, Asian or European people in this movie?","label":0},{"index":10582,"txt":"First of all, excuse my bad English Of course only a movie starring Jessica Simpson can include serious goofs like this..

Norwegian priests never use those black capes with that white paper by the neck as the protestant church is the dominant by far It is true we have a native traditional folkoutfit that we only use like twice a year but the outfit in this movie is more like a German outfit. I could NOT understand the so called norwegian in this movie.. Jessica was not making any sense.. neighter did the norwegian priestsThe only thing I recognise is the norwegian flag and the viking hats, but that is so stereotypic what people think about norway  vikings!O goshWell..

There is a shot where the Aquafresh sign sticks out at you that you cannot help but notice it.

When she arrives she discovers he is not quite as faithful as he should be. Katie then ends up venturing into the adventure that is New York. Filling in as bike messenger comedic and charming mishaps ensues. She falls into a hole in the ground and thus meets charismatic goodguy Ben Luke Wilson. It is not love at first sight, at least for her, but destiny and Ben, will not give up quite that easy. Being just a smalltown girl AND blonde a couple of evil executives at a building firm decides she is the perfect scapegoat for their cunning plan. Misunderstandings with hilarious and sad consequences follow. However, this is one blonde who will not take it lying down!People being judgmental of this film will soon enough be proved wrong. The jokes are confident and fitting, and the story well developed. The relationship between Katie and Ben feels so natural that it puts anything Godard has created to shame. The multitalented Jessica Simpson once again surprises with a strong role only she could pull off. Simpson really is the Marilyn Monroe of our day there is even one scene honoring her!. She balances perfectly between vulnerable and whimsy. Katie really does show us that you cannot judge a book by its cover! Luke Wilson is as charming as ever. Even if he was covered in manure that man would be as appealing as anyone. His light touch, puppy dog eyes and laid back manner makes it difficult to resist. Andy Dick plays the role he was born to play, one of the two diabolical executives. He really cannot be underestimated. The strength of the performance lies in his restraint. It is remarkable, because most actors would just run away with it and play it for cheap laughs. Not this guy! In conclusion, director Scott Marshall has crafted an intelligent and frequently hilarious comedy that is destined to become a classic alongside masterpieces of cinema like Epic Movie and Norbit. Kudos to everyone involved in this, especially Jessica Simpson. Her sincere smile and wholehearted laughter would make even the toughest man break out in a big grin. You may be tough, but you are not THAT tough! Warmly recommended to everyone who wants to be swept off their feet and see a romantic comedy that for once, feels honest. Thank you for this film!

Someone might have wanted to let him know that you can, in fact, shoot a scene in a cab in New York, and it will look real, and you will not have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason.

I mean you expect a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad, but this... it is not just bad, it is the complete opposite of a classic film.

Its also a sorta liberal version of the story, Frollo is a suppressor of Enlightenment ideals, like the abbot in Name of the Rose, and Quasimodo is a champion of liberty. The shadowy side of the Quas character is ignored, though he does pour liquid led on people. He is really only an outsider in that he looks different and enjoys playing with bells more than the average person.

You get the idea of their desolation and isolation, but not much more. The lighting, the colors, the body language, the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon.

There is a difference, however, between using restraint and encouraging narcolepsy among audience members. In The Secret Lives of Dentists, starring Campbell Scott and Hope Davis, director Alan Rudolph plays as close to the vest as possible, with the result being a film that never amounts to much beyond a rumination on how teeth are a metaphor for married life.Scott gives a fine performance in the role of David Hurst, a dentist married to another dentist Davis. Rudolph sets up the dynamic of their relationship quickly  he is completely absorbed in the daytoday duties of being the parenthood, she is quietly disillusioned with their frantic family life  and then ratchets up the tension when Scott may or may not witness his wife with another man. From this point on, the film focuses on whether or not David is going to confront his wife Dana about her possible adultery, or whether she will beat him to the punch and leave for good. From time to time, David is treated to visits from an imaginary friend in the form of a former patient played by Denis Leary borrowing heavily from Brad Pitts Tyler Durden in Fight Club.While there is enough uncertainty about Danas infidelity and Davids instability to warrant examination, the last two thirds of the film are embarrassingly empty of theme or narrative. Instead, Rudolph creates drama out of a nasty fever that travels slowly through the Hurst family, culminating in a pointless hospital visit at the films climax. The film never picks up on the hints at what David is really capable of if he was not so dedicated to his family; neither does it spend much time looking at Danas precarious balancing act between her family life and her other, more fulfilling ambitions.By choosing to spend the majority of the film worrying over a fever gone awry, Rudolph kills the momentum of his film. By the time the fifth member of the family shows up sweating and sickly, the film has used up all the good graces of Scotts wellmeasured performance. David and Dana end up retracing their steps over and over again until a less than cathartic finale. With nothing to build on over the last hour, the conclusion seems awkward and patchedon. The Secret Lives of Dentists takes a common theme and does nothing to improve upon it. Altogether, a disappointing, unimaginative film.","label":0},{"index":10602,"txt":"Yeh, I know  you are quivering with excitement.

It concerns the story of a married couple who happen to be dentists and who share the same practice already a recipe for trouble if it was not for our separate worklives, we would all ditch our spouses out of sheer irritation. Campbell Scott, whose mustache and demeanor do not recall Everyman so much as Ned Flanders from The Simpsons, is the mildmannered, uberDad husband, and Hope Davis is the boredstiff housewife who channels her frustrations into amateur opera. One night, as Dad  the daughters attend one of Davis performances, he discovers that his wife is channeling her frustrations into more than just singing he witnesses his wife kissing and flirting with the director of opera. One nice touch we never see the operadirectors face. Dreading the prospect of instituting the proceedings for separation, divorce, and custody hearings  profitable only to the lawyers  Scott chooses to pretend ignorance of his wifes indiscretions.Already, the literate among you are starting to yawn hohum, another story about the Pathetic, Sniveling Little Cuckold. But Rudolph, who took the story from a Jane Smiley novella, hopes that the wellwornness of the material will be compensated for by a series of flashy, postmodern touches. For instance, one of Scotts belligerent patients Denis Leary, kept relatively  and blessedly  in check will later become a sort of construction of the dentists imagination, emerging as a Devilontheshoulder advocate for the oldfashioned masculine virtues Dump the bh!, etc.. When not eggedon by his imaginary new buddy, Scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include his wife engaged in a threeway with two of the male dentalassistants who work in their practice. It is not going too far to say that this movie is Eyes Wide Shut for Real People or GrownUps, at least. Along those lines, Campbell Scott and Hope Davis are certainly recognizable human beings as compared to the glamourpuss pair of Cruise and Kidman. Further, the script for Secret Lives is clearly more relevant than Kubricks. As proof, I offer the depiction of the dentists children, particularly the youngest one who is about 3 or 4 years old, and whose main utterance is Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! DAD!!! This is Family Life, all right, with all its charms.The movie would make an interesting doublebill with Kramer vs. Kramer, as well. One can easily trace the Feminization of the American Male from 1979 to 2003. In this movie, Dad is the housewife as in Kramer, but he is in no way flustered by the domestic role, unlike Dustin Hoffman, who was too manly to make toast. Here, Scott gets all the plumb chores, such as wiping up the childrens vomit, cooking, cleaning, taking the kids to whatever inane afterschool activity is on the docket. And all without complaint. And without directorial commentary. It is just taken for granted.The film has virtues, mostly having to do with verisimilitude. However, it is dragged down from greatness by its insistence on trendy distractions, which culminate in a long scene where a horrible fiveday stomach flu makes the rounds in the household. We must endure pointless fantasy sequences, initiated by the imaginary ringleader Leary. Whose existence, by the way, is finally reminiscent of the Brad Pitt character in Fight Club. And this finally drives home the films other big flaw lack of originality. In this review, I realize it is been far too easy to reference many other films. Granted, this film is an improvement on most of them, but still. The Secret Lives of Dentists is worth seeing, but do not get too excited about it. Not that you were all that excited, anyway.

He had an intelligent interest in science,and like many other people in the 19th century saw a bright future because of the improvements it would bring.Far from exiling Pasteur, he was his PATRON,building him a laboratory and providing him with all the resources that he needed for his research.While the lab was under construction, Pasteur became gravely ill.A bureaucrat, deciding it was a waste of money to build a laboratory for someone who would soon be dead, ordered work halted on his own authority.When the emperor heard about this, his outrage shook the bureaucracy so that there was a flurry of buckpassing, and work promptly resumed.The Emperor personally visited Pasteur to comfort him and reassure him that he would get his lab.The emperor would often bring members of his court to admire Pasteurs projects,and it was obvious to everyone that Pasteur was one of the emperors favorites.Pasteurs main worry concerning the Emperor was that Napoleon thought Pasteur was virtually a miracle worker who could do almost anything, and was constantly assigning him tasks outside of his previous experience.Pasteur, a very modest man, was always protesting this, but Napoleon would say that he had complete faith in him,and Pasteur despite his misgivings, always came through.They always had a close and friendly relationship,and after the Emperor was overthrown, Pasteur refused to say a bad word about him,grateful to the end of his life.The part about his daughter having the baby, and Pasteur sacrificing his principles to get a doctor, never happened.The part about the anthrax and rabies, for which he was famous, is generally correct, but the notion that the anthrax experiment raised him from obscurity to fame is false.He was famous and respected at the time this happened.This movie is OK from a dramatic standpoint,but very distorted as biography.","label":0},{"index":10621,"txt":"I really do not understand all these positive user reviews.

Unlike Star Wars, the movie Titanic has not yet? become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made which will resonate with the audience.In ThumbTanic, the holes are filled by oneoff jokes which do not really seem related to anything. For example, the heros insinuation that the heroine is not clean during the jump off end of ship scene  it is not funny. Rather, you just think to yourself, Did I miss something in the original movie?. There were too many of these type of baseless jokes cf. arachnid.By contrast, the sendup of the smarmy ships designer had meaning and was funny. Also very funny was the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go faster as a maniac running around demanding everything be faster including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die. These sort of jokes meant something in the Titanic context and lent meaningful humour to Thumbtanic.The thumb media, the faces and the voices, are still amusing.

Maybe it was the perspective of a few years away, but this movie seemed to capture the essence of the city and its people better than anything else I would ever seen still does. It concentrates on one particular community  the Chinese  but that is fine, because so much of the citys soul is refracted through the settings, the faces, and the maybe above all the voices of the characters.This is not the tourists San Francisco. The settings are humble and everyday a taxi cab, the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant, Richmond District row houses, little Chinatown apartments and smallbusiness offices, the piers, a Philippine elder center. This is what the city looks and feels like day to day to the people who live there  even now, in the era of Silicon Gulch urban redevelopment. Unlike, say, Dirty Harry in its own way an excellent San Francisco movie as well, everything is filmed at street level We come to understand the characters points of view from the perspective their surroundings give them, not from some fancy vertiginous shooting.Wang apparently filmed in BW because he did not have the money to do otherwise, yet one of the strongest visual elements of the movie is the natural light he achieves. The often harsh, pervasive quality of the sunlight is one of my closest associations with San Francisco It seems to expose everything, bringing the buildings, the hills, the other landmarks down in scale and, in a funny way, making the people you pass on the streets seem more individual and potentially closer to you than they might in another place. Wangs photography perfectly conveys this, and even helps the story along at points.Wang captures the speech and conversational style of Chinese and other San Franciscans better than anyone ever has, I think. If there is such thing as a true San Francisco accent, it is what you hear from the balding taxi medallion broker I think who appears talking on the phone in one scene listen to the way he calls the person on the other end ya dingaling!.The story is poignant and, despite a few very small missteps, makes its points beautifully about the longings that pull at the hearts of people living in old immigrant communities  including the justified political and ethnic resentments, and little ironic amusements, that help to fuel them. All this is communicated delicately  perhaps why some respondents here think the film meanders. It does not  suffice it to say that the two cab drivers quest for Chan becomes a quest for something more personal.Chan Is Missing finishes up with a Chinatown travelogue sequence backed by a goofy novelty song from the 1930s I guess about San Francisco and all its crazy diversity.

They may not all be prostitutes for hire, but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered. From the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then end up hiring the dancers for private sessions. Even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the dancers only playing to the women in the audience. This just is not the reality of these clubs. It would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples. So what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients? We learn very little. Instead we get filler. A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers. A manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag acts but offers no insight into the dancers lives and attitudes.The pictures of Mexico City are generic.

When a successful young young man Christenson goes under the knife and realizes that the anaesthesia has not quite done its job, the horror quickly sets in as his worried wife Alba waits anxiously and a terrifying drama unfolds in the operating room.Hoping to do for operating tables what Final Destination did for planes, this first effort from director Joby Harold pivots on a bloodfrosting conceit.

Uncreative story lines, but not bad enough to ruin the movie. The only real oy vey! moment was the name of Lena Olins character. Overbearing woman named Lilith...subtle!The surgical scenes are not at all censored. I appreciated that, people who find surgery scenes scary might not.

The moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia, he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him.The big twist, however, is very predictable and sends the film delving into the conspiracy and his memories of the little signs which were there but he, like us, initially missed. There are two more twists at the end involving his relationship with his mother. One is an impressive gesture by Olin, which comes of as unimpressive due to poor writing.

On the night that these two secretly get married, it just so happens that a heart donor with the same rare blood type is found. Go and figure the odds of that one! Once on the operating table, Clay finds out the anesthesia is not working, and he can feel everything and hear everything.Fortunately Clay seems to be able to filter out the pain of a razor sharp scalpel cutting open his chest by simply concentrating on his memories of Samantha, which we are told he is doing through an annoying voiceover which never seems to stop.If you did not burst out in laughter yet, you will surely start to when you see the surgical scenes. How could a young billionaire agree to have a heart transplant performed by one surgeon, one nurse, an attending physician and an drunk anesthesiologist? There were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was getting pulled. Not to mention the medical behavior, which is too preposterous to be taken seriously...the operating room is not even kept sterile...people are practically able to just walk in and out of the room without even having washed up... During the operation the viewer gets to hear Clays thoughts, none of which are too fascinating. Ah...but heres what it is all about ...the doctors are trying to kill him in order to take his money. Believing him to be unconscious, the villains speak freely. Gosh! What will happen? Well... at least there is no interference from anyone else in the hospital, while an incompetent doctor who is got four malpractice lawsuits running against him is performing major heart surgery. Not even Clays overprotective mother seems to be able to check on his status. The only one interested in keeping updated is Samantha...but oh no...could sweet Sam be in on it....You will quickly find out through some Scooby Doo dialog...In the end, it would not even matter whether or not Clay underwent anesthesia awareness, because the end would have turned out the same way in both cases.If you can ignore the feeling that the directorwriter is trying to make fun of the patients who fell victim to anesthesia awareness, maybe there is some dumb fun to be had...Enjoy...","label":0},{"index":10640,"txt":"OK. So it is a lowbudget film I used the quotes because it was shot in Hi8 video. The acting is universally horrid, the makeup is laughable the blood looks like it came from SherwinWilliams and I have seen more convincing bruises made from halloween ghoul kits, and the lighting generally looks like they used someones borrowed Toyota pickup to shine headlights on the actors.I might be able to forgive these lowbudget traits if there were some actual content, if a movie made an attempt to tell a story.

I found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes, that alone did not sit well with me. Weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first 10 times.There was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film. More like a 45 minute Boys Brief short rather than a fleshed out fulllength film. It had a certain erotic flair, male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its parts.The 1st part BoxerStalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin. Bob has been following Tim for four years and only now is he confronting him? I felt as though their catmouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion. We needed more information about them and less Parking LotLocker scenes with Tim relentlessly saying What do you want? The 2nd part Danny wants his buddy, Tony, to beat him up while he jacksoff. Tony does not seem to mind, but he does not even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby  not even after they do it in the nude. This tale lacks the allimportant transition from I am a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun to I think I might be gay and hitting him because I would like to spread his ass and do him SM style. A very important thing to leave out.Clearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time. The 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought. Furthermore, it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film. Yes, the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy. The makeup bruises and cuts however was on par with a grammar school talent show.There was not enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic. The film made no statement, squandered time, and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment. Its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach, that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously.","label":0},{"index":10643,"txt":"I give this film it is props that it is very well made and reasonably well acted. BUt I could not get past the implausibility of the whole thing.First and foremost, a game built around the notion of Russian Roulette that has to fill on hour. the big problem is that if you are doing a live show, you run the possibility that your first contestant will be the one unlucky enough to draw the real bullet. Then what do you do? You have 50 minutes of show to fill and nothing to show. The corollary is that Okay, you get to the end and the first five contestants survive, which means number six has the bullet and cannot possibly get the payout. He is not going to shoot himself at that point, so it is kind of anticlimatic. second problem, almost as big. Human nature. People are going to flinch, panic, soil their underwear and do things that would otherwise not make very good television. Too much randomness. That is why real Reality television is actually tightly scripted and even more tightly edited.The only random thing is the performance artists rant about female sacrifices, which were actually rare historically. Even that was predictable, since she went through with shooting herself to no effect. We are led to believe the shows ratings would increase while it was going on at 1 AM in the morning unlikely with the token Asian girl announcing each boost in ratings.A point on race and sex. Big surprise the movies two minority one gay and two female contestants are the ones who survive. So we are left with the two white males, and of course, the slightly less likable of them is the one who buys it. The purpose of such a show would be it is randomness, but the guy you like the least is the guy who dies.the Climax is that after spending two hours fighting for televised suicide, the Eva Mendes character Mendes produced and starred in this thing, so she has no one to blame but herself actually grows a conscience when someone dies. What did she THINK was going to happen? She is promptly shot by a bystander angry about the whole thing motives never explained and the show went on to be a big hit. Really? the problem with media satire is that it has to either have some grounding in reality or it has to be so over the top to be ludicrous like Network. This is neither.","label":0},{"index":10644,"txt":"I saw Shiner on DVD. While I was watching it, I thought, This is a really bad porn flick without the porn. I also thought, Whoever wrote this has some real issues. Then I watched the directorwriter Carlson explain his process as a special feature. Yeah, it was real special.The emphasis of the film is placed on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get off. They are marginally attractive. There is frontal and full nudity. These factors probably account for the film being seen at all.The most upsetting element of the film is the gay bashing and the subsequent further gay bashing of the same victim who tries ineptly to exact revenge from his assailants, the two drunken losers. Not only is the subject handled absurdly and badly from a technical point of view, but the acting is horrendously bad.Then there is the boxerstalker theme. This is really insane, not just absurd. This hunky boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attentions of a fleshy mommas boy who works at his gyms parking lot. This is in LA, mind you. The boxer is so traumatized that he turns up at the stalkers house, strips in front of him and gets excited in the process.Well, all I can say is, why would a boxer who is at heart an exhibitionist be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker? It simply makes no sense. And, I am afraid, some psychodynamics actually do make sense, if you take the time to read about them. However, bad scripts seldom make sense at all.The directorwriter seems to have thought that this film represents a considerable minority within the gay community. Well, he may be correct, I suppose. We may never know, since that minority would be so dysfunctional they would hardly be able to get organized enough to ever get to an obscure gay film festival or DVD store, the only two places they could possibly find this turkey. Thank goodness for that.","label":0},{"index":10645,"txt":"What an unfortunate mess is Shiner. I wanted to like this overthetop, antifilm aspirant, and in fact found a number of moments with powerful resonance. Sadly, those moments are few and far between. While I appreciate some of what Calson was attempting, any advantage aspired to by bare bones, no budget cinematography was destroyed with some truly atrocious editing that benefited the movie not at all.While bad acting abounds in low budget and big budget cinema, Shiner has some remarkably bad performances that are nearly painful to watch. In particular the straight couple Linda and Young Guy. These are the two most poorly written characters offering almost nothing to the story. The acting is so abysmal and neither actor seems capable of resisting smirking or cracking up as they drearily drop their lines with an appalling lack of skill. The choppy editing almost lends the feeling that these roles were entirely gratuitous and dropped in to avoid the films being stereotypically cast as an oddball gay film. It would have been better off as such.With all that is going wrong for it, there are several performances that seem to capture what Calson was hoping to get. In particular the story centering on Bob and Tim. These are the two most richly drawn characters and offer the most rewards with genuinely captivating performances by Nicholas T. King Bob and David Zelinas Tim. Tim is a boxer with some serious issues. Remarkably low self esteem is disguised by an almost cartoon like arrogance that he wears like armour plating. Obsessed with Tim, the seemingly harmless yet ultimately creepy Bob, stalks the boxer in classic catandmouse fashion. When the tables are turned and hunter becomes the hunted, the resulting in the films only genuine emotional catharsis. In a film so artificially hardedged that is a compliment one character MUST have that revelatory break through or breakdown, as the case proves here and the final confrontation between Bob and Tim provide Zelinas and King opportunity to display some real acting chops.As played by Scott Stepp and Derris Nile, Tony and Danny seem to be the focus of the movie, and despite some bravado moments of their own including one truly disturbing scene revealing the sexviolence obsession, but they cannot seem to escape a cartoonlike artifice and it is difficult to look at  or beyond their seeming one note symphony and find anything other than the obvious.Ultimately this same raw material could and should be used to tell this story in better fashion. Alas, there really is not much to recommend this yet, the performances by Messrs. King and Zelinas, really do offer something special and a glimpse of what might have been and are ultimately worth seeing.","label":0},{"index":10646,"txt":"Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, centers around three couples and their relationships with obsession and violence. Pretty good start as far as I am concerned. Interesting. The couples break down into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual male friends and a straight guy being harmlessly stalked by a gay man.The het couple really do not have much of a role in the film. There are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when having sex or playing around with each other, but seem to have no real purpose since the are so marginalized. My assumption is that they represent a more day to day illustration of how sexviolence are integrated in a couples life. The couple are not very aggressive and it is not even shot in any kind of erotic way. As characters, they do not add much to the theme or plot.The two male friends make up the bulk of the plot. They engage in some gay bashing of sorts by convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in an alley. This escalates into violence. And the violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. And their need for violence t release grows as the film progresses. The main problem I had is the violence is not convincing. Never once does it seem that any of the characters is in any real danger. It just does not work. Given that the whole theme of the film is about the characters relationships with violence, this is a major problem. Unfortunately, the makeup does not help either. Sometimes, it is okay, other times it is very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one of the characters had rouge smeared on his face. Confusing.The more interesting pair of the characters is the stalker couple. Here Calson seemed to have more to say and was able to develop a more coherent storyline. Perhaps it is because the characters seem to develop more and have resolution at the end. Shiner may well have been much better if it had stuck with these two.I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film. It is admirable. Most low budget flicks do not aspire to much. I do not think Calson achieved want he was aiming for. Myself, I found nothing particularly controversial or unsettling. Shiner was unconvincing. This does not mean, however, that the director cannot achieve something with his next film.He seems to have something to say.","label":0},{"index":10647,"txt":"This is by far the worst film I have seen in my entire life.

The guns are more quiet than a mute. How this film could have one two awards puts serious questions to the state of the human mind. Well thats about it.

I have never seen a movie with this many bad performances. In the case of Luke Askew, the chief villain, it is clear this is because of poor dialogue and direction, as he is done good work in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is an embarrassing ham. The writing is just bloody awful, and the actors cannot be faulted for the terrible things they have to say. But they say them so badly! The editing and direction are worse than pedestrian. Shots are held way too long for no dramatic reason, or cut off before the impact of the scene can be realized. This picture was far worse than I would imagined and would have been utterly forgotten and probably never even made without the participation of a couple of famous names. One bright spot the cinematography in the Grand Canyon is exquisite, capturing the beauty of that area in a way even bigscreen Imax productions have not quite done so well. And finally either this is a bad version of Paper Moon, with a lovable pair of fatherdaughter types, or it is a bad version of Pretty Baby, with a considerably more icky romantic relationship between a fortysomething and a 13yearold.

Ropsenlski wants to negotiate with David for the CD by getting his exwife Liz to talk to him about giving it up, Rosnelski made a deal to pay off her debts if she comes through. David is later killed by Rosenliskis Mexican hitman Tony, with the help of a great white shark, who just does not go for all this peaceful dealings on his boss part.

Concerning the Wayans and Co. latest addition to the moving pictures scenario; Little Man. This United Kingdom P.G. Parental Guidance, anyone under the age of twelve must be accompanied by a responsible adult, certificated movie, is the epitome of what has now developed into the worse case of dumbing down since cigarettes were wiped out from pictures of movie icons of the 1950s.The predominantly under twelves audience here who, some without grown up supervision too, sat there, obediently, taking it all in, oblivious to their subject and the partly grown up features that Little Man portrays, in part at least too. Movies, in general, can do better than this poor attempt, while this nonsense is getting them in while they are still young and fresh, the biggest fear for the future of Cinema is that a childs ignorance just might carry on through to a grown up bliss. Cinema deserves more than this, and so do its ever growing, and in the literal sense too, audiences, this blatant cash cow feeds on the everimpressionable minds of the young.There is no Cinema experience here, no open eyed wonder, no aweinspiring respect to the magic of movies. There is nothing but bewilderment and contempt, for the lack of substance, originality and its delivery of mind less tedium and parody of everything that is so now ultimately wrong with the Hollywood machine, for the sake of a quick buck, we must endure our future cinema audiences to the likes of this archetypal disaster movie.Will this have the likes of Hitchcock, Fassbinder, Leone, Kubrick and Schaffner reeling in their graves? Money they all liked, no doubt, but talent and exuberance for perfection and quality, and to a vast degree, respect for their profession and audience, they were never short off. We are seeing, once again, with the works of the Wayans clan another clich\u00e9 of bad taste, while the likes of White Chicks 2004 were in no doubt a stab at the bourgeoisie of American society. The irony here is that the two leading protagonists, played yet again, by the Wayans brothers, are so much undercover, that all recognition is nonexistent, this makes for a better movie too, and it is the actor Terry Crews that gives White Chicks its substance and personality, not the Wayans.Yet again, with their pastiche of 1970s Blaxploitation movies, as with the 1988 movie I am Gonna Git You Sucka, this to can be seen as a comical and amusing movie, with heavy weights as Isaac Hayes, Jim Brown, Bernie Casey and the gorgeous actress Janet Du Bois. The point being, that Little Man has absolutely no persona of any kind what so ever, he is shallow and narcissistic, with no appreciation or value toward his followers, he quickly dives in takes your money and before we know it, has hidden himself within the cogs of commercialism. There is no recognisable effort as to where our money has been spent, after Scary Movie 2000, things could only have gone up, but alas they did not, no great pondering of artistic value and no doubt that the instalment from these intrepid movie moguls next movies shall be straight to video, one can only hope.The Wayans seem to have created a movie genre all by themselves, to a certain extent; they have bludgeoned to death the movie parody, they have watered down each and every avenue and with their inevitable style.

This movie and I use that word with some reservations evokes these feelings with an intense purity. This vision of hell follows the adventures of Calvin, a freakish jewel thief who was created by attaching the severed head of Marlon Wayan onto the body of a two foothigh dwarf. After inadvertently dropping a large diamond into the handbag of Vanessa, a careerwoman who is reluctant to have children, Calvin realises that in order to recover the diamond he must ingratiate himself with her. So, as any normal man would, Calvin dresses himself up as a 2 yearold and parks himself upon the poor womans doorstep, where he is discovered by Darryl, the broody husband of Vanessa. Darryl incongruously falls for Calvins disguise despite the fact that the baby has a full set of teeth, stubble, a tattoo, a knifescar, and the sexdrive of a 16yearold. Even more absurdly, Vanessa does not see past Calvins babywear either and actually attempts to breastfeed the diminutive pervert. This wretched assault upon the soul of mankind attempts, and fails, to find humour in rape, scatology, sexual assault, and paedophilia, however, in a dishonest attempt to transform itself into a piece of familyentertainment the Wayan brothers stir in a sickening amount of sentiment and flawed morality. The brothers dim attempt a Freudian rehabilitation of their thieving rapist by revealing that he had a bad father. Repeatedly hitting Darryl in the crotch enables Calvin to develop the loving fatherson relationship that both he and Darryl have always wished for. As if this was not ridiculous enough, Calvins attempts to sexually assault Vanessa somehow convince her that it is selfish for a woman to indulge herself with a successful career, and that instead she should spend her life playing the role of the housebound littlewoman, who spends her time alternatively squeezing out babies and cooking for her husband. In this movie the Wayan brothers have mixed their crass and twisted form of humour together with the clich\u00e9d sentimentality that has infected much of Hollywoods recent body of work. Additionally, they are endemic of the current generation of black comedians who are responsible for transforming AfricanAmerican humour into a poor and wretched shadow of itself that overindulges in fartjokes and crude sexual gags.

We decided to stop after a good half an hour. The movie is okay, there are funny parts in it alright. But what for? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies. What Lion King 1 12 is for me is a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already, plus telling the story from their point of view. But what for? I would really like to know. You know, the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one, is really nice. But what comes after is mostly unnecessary. I guess many people liked Timon and Pumba, and so do I really. Yet, for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny. No chance, most of it was not funny at all, at least for me. Btw. what was the movie about anyway? Was it a about Timon and Pumba or b an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie? I tend to choose option b and I am very disappointed about it.If you like to see stories like the story behind xy, you should see Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead by Tom Stoppard with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman.

I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man, however, had very few laughs and the jokes were stale.Obviously, the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans, who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond meant for a gangster. Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep. Of course, he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour. All these talents, however, cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny.The special effects to make Marlon Wayans to look like a midget was OK. I mean, it was not 100 believable but it was OK...nothing great.

David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer, and his renditions of Havin My Baby and Movin On Up were priceless. John Witherspoon, who, coincidentally, played Griers father in 1992s Boomerang if you remember, he coordinated the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket now plays Vanessas father in Little Man. So that was fun.Beyond that, this movie is about as believable as White Chicks. How dumb is it when even the doctor cannot tell that it is a 40yearold man and not a baby? He is got a full set of teeth!!! How is it possible that no one seems to notice that it is not a baby? Little Man is so bad that there is a Rob Schneider cameo.

Timon decides to go back BEFORE the beginning, to when the story really began. So they go back. Way back. Back even before Simba was born. Back to Timons old home which was miles away from Pride Rock. A clan of meerkats burrowed underground to hide from hyenas. The worst digger in the clan was a pompous, selfcentered meerkat named Timon. His mother took pity on him but Uncle Max just shook his head. Mother suggested putting Timon on sentry duty; Timon had dreams of a bigger and better place out there somewhere. Just then, hyenas Shenzi, Bonzai and Ed arrived and nearly killed poor Uncle Max. That did it. The other meerkats just wanted Timon to go away while Timon took it upon himself to leave. So he kissed his mom goodbye and started off. He did not get very far before he started getting homesick. Just then he met Rafiki, who taught him to look beyond what he sees. Timon had no clue what that meant so he continued on and met a warthog named Pumbaa, who was all alone due to a flatulence problem. Timon and Pumbaa join up then, but Timon declared them acquaintances, rather than friends. They soon arrive at Pride Rock where all the zebras, antelopes, wildebeests, rhinoceroses, giraffes, elephants and many other plain animals had gathered. What was going on? Timon did not care. They pressed on. Timon then saw Rafiki atop Pride Rock lifting into the air something he could not see. Just then all the animals took a bow. Was this to honor the birth of the new king? No, Pumbaa had passed gas and the animals were bowing to cover their noses; Timon and Pumbaa try an assortment of new homes, but each are discomforting due to incessant singing or hyenas or a large stampede of wildebeests! Pumbaa and Timon suddenly find themselves heading down stream. When they reach land, Timon decides to give up. But then they gaze around at their newfound paradise. It was beautiful trees and water falls as far as the eye could see. Timon named the place after a strange phrase he learned from Rafiki Hakuna Matata. Timon and Pumbaa go out bowling for buzzards one afternoon when they suddenly run into Simba. They take him under their wing and become father figures. They teach him the arts of bug eating and belching contests. Pretty soon, a teenage Simba takes on Timon in a snail slurping contest. Simba won, leaving Timon deathly ill. Then one day, Simbas childhood friend Nala arrived. Timon and Pumbaa just knew she would break up the friendship. Suddenly, Simba runs away. Nala and Pumbaa race after him, but not Timon. He chose to stay at Hakuna Matata by himself, until Rafiki talked some sense into him, so he joins his friends at Pride Rock. Timons mother and Uncle Max arrive then. While Simba battles Scar, Mother and Max dig a large hole to trap hyenas Shenzi, Bonzai and Ed in. It worked. Scar is soon flung down the same hole where he is devoured by the hyenas. Then all is well. Mother, Uncle Max and the rest of the meerkats go live with Timon and Pumbaa in the paradise that is Hakuna Matata. Back to the present, Timon and Pumbaa finish the movie when suddenly Mother, Uncle Max, Simba and Rafiki want to watch it again. So do Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Snow White, the Seven Dwarfs, Dumbo, Peter Pan, the Lost Boys, Mad Hatter, March Hare, Genie, Aladdin, and Jasmine. Well, I must say that The Lion King 1 12 was not as good as I had hoped. It was too ridiculous and silly. The original Lion King was a masterpiece. It had a serious story with light comedy thrown in. This one was just silly and made a mockery of it. I swear, sometimes Timon and Pumbaa are just way too overplayed. They are overplayed to the point of no longer being funny, just annoying. The original voice cast is back Nathan Lane as Timon, Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa, Matthew Broddrick as Adult Simba, Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi, Cheech Marin as Bonzai, Jim Cummings as Ed, Robert Guillame as Rafiki. New to the cast are Julie Kavner of TVs Too long running series The Simpsons as Timons mom and Jerry Stiller as Uncle Max. So anyway, this movie is not The Lion King III, and it is not II because there already is a II. It takes place right after Part I and Part II is a ways away. Hence, it is 1 12. In conclusion, I do not recommend this to die hard Lion King fans because it is far too ridiculous and frivilous. However the kids will love it so I recommend it to them. I hope this will also be the LAST Lion King movie. Two is enough. The Lion King 1 12.

Even with warnings by the caretaker, the director pays no attention to the supposedly cursed house. One of the crew find a book titled Tibetan Book of the Dead, and use some of the passages from it for their script. But in doing so, when red they raise a ghoul from its grave.Boring, confusing and tacky all rolled up into one, equals this penniless midnight horror production. What feels like an eternity, it just never seems to get going or demonstrate anything effective from somewhat decent ideas. Even though director Paul Harrisons clunky, tensionless direction did construct a couple eerie, moody and atmospheric setpieces. But laziness did set it early. The whole film within a film structure takes up most of the movie and in this time little to nothing happens of great interest. Nor is it fun. Think of Bob Clarks Children Should not Play with Dead Things 1972, and now we have got older actors in the part. However I found Seven Corpses to be inferior. The script early on has some cutting wit abound, before it ends up being drab, predictable and left with many unfulfilled possibilities. The cheap foundation involving limited sets did not help matters either, but the mansions dreary, dark appearance had a creepy air to it. Performances from a recognizable bcast is mainly rigid. John Carradine in small part mainly lurks about. John Ireland plays a hotheaded director, Faith Domergues washedup actress demands attention and Charles Macaulay hams it up. The slow grinding premise is crossed between Ten Little Indians and your usual zombie setup. However its not all that engaging, even with its occult and supernatural edge. Hell they even throw in some graveyard action, with no prevail. When the rotting ghoul makes its appearance\u0085 finally, but a bit late. It does get a little better, if very baffling. Just like the inspired opening, the ending is deliciously downbeat. To bad in between, it constantly drags. Continuity in many scenes comes across nonexistent, and the death scenes are more exciting and bloodier but indeed poorly executed in the movie they are making, then what actually happens to them when the zombie appears. The generic music score flounders on with its shuddery, but frank Gothic cues, and the camerawork is blandly staged with a lack of imagination. Shoot and frame. Shoot and frame. Job done.

I normally sanctify stuff like this! Early 70s grindhouse flicks with scrumptious sounding titles and a schlocky lowbudget atmosphere usually ROCK. House of Seven Corpses appeared to dispose of even more trumps, since the cast is a gathering of great genre veterans including John Carradine, John Ireland and Faith Domergue and the filming locations the titular house, the graveyard are obviously very expedient for a gloomy tale of terror. The film opens with its absolute greatest and most hauntingly memorable sequences, though sadly enough they are the only ones that qualify as such. The credits are a splendid montage, complete with freakish coloreffects and eerie freezeframes, illustrating how the titular house received its notorious reputation. The last seven owners were mysteriously murdered here and the credits montage gleefully exhibits their final moments. Someone falls down the balcony screaming, a lady drowns in her bathtub, and another female body hangs dangling from the ceiling and four more macabre tableaux. Needless to say the house is cursed and the awkward behavior of t caretaker Mr. Price Carradine only fortify this reputation. In other words, the house forms the ideal turf for the acclaimed director Eric Hartman John Ireland to shoot his satanic horror film project. The filmwithinfilm structure is what mainly causes House of Seven Corpses to be so boring and uneventful. A lot of moviematerial is wasted on crew members putting films spools in the camera and dragging around cables or \u0096 even worse \u0096 Faith Domergue and Charles Macaulay portraying horridly intolerable actor stereotypes. The plot finally gets a little interesting only a little, mind you when one of the characters reads some lines from an occult book and accidentally awakes a rotting corpse in the backyard. The asthmatic judging by the noises he produces zombie slowly heads for the house and kills the entire movie crew, reminiscent of how the previous seven turned into corpses. After a running time of approximately 60 minutes, the film suddenly turns from humdrum into just plain weird and confusing. I am still unsure whether the final twist has to do with the concept of reincarnation or just coincidence and all the remaining characters suddenly seem to go undergo vast mental transformations shortly before they die, for some reason. I honestly regret confirming House of Seven Corpses is a pretty dreadful movie. The locations and scenery are gloomy chilling, but not nearly used to full effect and there is a serious lack of gruesome bloodshed. Numerous lowbudgeted 70s gems were stunningly gross, so the lack of financial means is no excuse and the filmwithinfilm murders really do not count.

It is reasoned that the spells in the book are better written than the script they are using. But as the book is read, the graveyard outside suddenly comes to life. Now the cast and crew are faced with real danger . IMDb lists a running time of 90 minutes. For the first 60 of those minutes, nothing happens. Far too much time is spent on the movie within a movie. Are we supposed to be frightened by the horror movie that they are shooting? We already know that their movie is not real. These scares just do not work. There are very few things to enjoy about The House of Seven Corpses. The acting is atrocious. Most of these actors would have trouble making a elementary school play. The score is terrible. It is very reminiscent of a 70s television series and provides no atmosphere. Speaking of atmosphere, other than a few moments at the end of the movie, there is none to speak of. Character logic is all but nonexistent. Even in a movie, you expect characters to behave in a certain way. Here, I do not think I remember one scene where a character did not choose the most illogical avenue available to them. And finally, there is those first 60 minutes of the movie that I have already mentioned. Can you say BORING?  I have not rated The House of Seven Corpses any lower because of instances where the movie probably by accident actually works. My two favorite are the beginning and ending.

John Carradine is shown twice walking down into a grave and pulling the lid shut after him. I anxiously awaited some kind of explanation for this odd behavior...naturally I assumed he had something to do with the evil goingson at the house, but since he got killed off by the first rising corpse hereafter referred to as Zombie 1, these scenes made absolutely no sense. Please, if someone out there knows why Carradine kept climbing down into graves  let the rest of us in on it!! All the action is confined to the last 20 minutes so I will attempt a synopsis. John Carradine comes out to the cemetery to investigate, and is throttled by Zombie 1. So far, so good. But then we get the confusing scene where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler, out for a little moonlight filming in the graveyard, discover Carradines dead body. Strickler repeatedly tries to push Ireland into the open grave from whence Zombie 1 had emerged, but Ireland succeeds in flipping him into the open grave instead, and PRESTO! Strickler comes out as Zombie 2! Yeah, I guess we can infer that Strickler was dead allalong a witch?, but why he changed from normal appearance into rottingflesh version by flying into Zombie 1s grave is never explained. Considering how excruciatingly slowmoving these zombies are, I would of thought he would have preferred to stay in his normal form until his business was concluded. This scene also brings a question to mind  just who the heck IS Zombie 1 ??? We can only assume Zombie 1 is one of the original murder victims shown during the movies opening credits, but who knows which one, nor why he has a particular grudge against the film crew.Anyway, after Ireland sees this transformation and runs away, we see the EXACT SAME SHOT of Zombie 2 shambling through the trees as we saw for Zombie 1. This leads to momentary confusion over just how MANY zombies there really are. Then in best 1950s horrormovie fashion Ireland manages to trip while fleeing. He conveniently knocks his head on the small headstone of Faith Domergues dead cat was not that nice of John Carradine to chisel a tombstone for a cat that he barely knew?Meanwhile, Zombie 1 has been wrecking havoc up at the house. He easily dispatches three filmcrew members, then starts up the stairs. Faith Domergue hears him, and thinking it is lover John Ireland back from his nightshoot, goes out. Upon seeing it is only Zombie 1, she lets out a scream and retreats into a bedroom where she retrieves Irelands revolver. While starlet Carole Wells is showering at this point and cannot hear the scream, her costar Charles Macauley who is boozing and hamming it up at a mirror in his bedroom does. Taking his sweet time and only after some more swigs from his hipflask he finally decides to investigate. One thing that strikes the viewer during the last quarter of this movie is how SLOW TO REACT the stars are to screams and gunshots. Domergue comes back out into the hallway armed and ready, but mistakes Macauley for Zombie 1 and shoots him six times! He does a nice acrobatic flip over the railing, then a horrified Domergue backs up, right into the waiting arms of Zombie 1.Carole Wells is by now out of her shower and drying off when she hears gunshots and Domergues screams; she too feels no great urgency in running out to investigate. So during this time Zombie 1 has time to string Domergue up from the neck with a rope. Wells sees Domergues hanging corpse and faints deadaway. The next time we see her is in a stream outside the house ???  but more on that later. Meantime, Ireland has recovered his senses and stumbles into the house where he discovers Zombie 1s bloody carnage. Though Ireland has just stumbled upon 3 murdered people he is more concerned that his film has been exposed and ruined! Mercifully for him and the audience, Zombie 1 throws some movie equipment down on his head from the 2nd floor. That is the last we see of Zombie 1. At this point the audience is treated to a montage of all the deaths, showing that the new ones mirror the old ones. How profound.Zombie 2, meanwhile, has gotten near the house remember, these zombies move as slow as molasses in January where he happens to see Carole Wells floating by in a stream, and fishes her out. How did she get there? Did Zombie 1 carry her down, throw her in, then zoom back upstairs just in time to crush John Ireland? Apparently one of the original victims was drowned in the tub, so Wells has to drown too but why outside in a stream, instead of in the tub, is never explained. Zombie 2 never makes it into the house himself everyones dead by now, anyways, thanks to Zombie 1 but instead he carries Carol Wells back to the graveyard. As the end credits flash on screen, we see Zombie 2 with his dead love still in his arms, descending into the open grave.The viewer is left wondering Yes, but was not this Zombie 1s grave? Why is Zombie 2 taking up residence? And what if Zombie 1 comes along and wants to climb back in  is Zombie 2 gonna let him, or will there be a zombie fight? Will the zombies share both the grave and the newly deceased Carole Wells? And what about nowdead John Carradine  where is he gonna stay? After all, from the earlier scenes we know he is clearly at home in the grave...

First off, it is interesting to see the approaches film makers take in trying to film essentially unfilmable works. Some have, as Kubrick did with Lolita, gotten the original author to write a screenplay that is something like the original work. Of course that cannot happen here; KraftEbing is long dead. Some have used the premises of the original work as a launch point to go in a completely new, unrelated direction the recent adaptation of Tristram Shandy comes to mind here. You can dumb it down  the film of Slaughterhouse Five is to my mind an example of that. Or you can simply take the format of the original and try to render it in cinematic vignettes. That would be the approach of Woody Allens Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex, and, arguably, this film. Upon consideration, it is probably the only thing one can do with a scholarly work like Psychopathia Sexualis. The potential loss is that whatever cumulative point the original work had is obscured or destroyed. And so it is here.Point two is the cinematic style. Some would call it an homage to Murnau, Pabst, Carl Dreyer, etc., but I think it more crude than that. Its far too heavy handed and selfconscious to be effective for long. It is eventually just annoying.Point three is perhaps a less intellectual observation. How did the people responsible for this manage to make a film about wild sexual deviations and perversion that is so incredibly boring? I found the film impossible to pay attention to, and anyone who is not automatically drawn to depictions of sexual deviance will find it so as well. I do not want to be completely uncharitable and say the film is pointless, but I have to say that whatever point the film makers had is rather obscured by the nature of the source material, the overt copying of filmic styles, and the stubborn refusal to engage the audience on an emotional level possibly for fear of being accused of titillation.The film is a dubious exercise from the start and does not really work for me, I am sorry to say.","label":0},{"index":10727,"txt":"Before seeing this movie, I was expecting a fictional drama based loosely on ideas from the book; instead, it is the book, interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating the different illnesses. That did not bother me much, but it hindered my enjoyment of the film. One story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed through the movie would have been preferable, in my opinion. If you are going to base a movie on a psychology text, you have got to find a more interesting and preferably accurate text than this one. The film drags during parts where it is little more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century sexual psychology and would be utterly intolerable if it were not sexual in nature because sex  interesting for most of us, even me. Luckily, there are several stories with actual character development that pull us in.But, disappointingly, KrafftEbings theories of sexuality went unchallenged, for the most part. I was hoping it would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology which is still held by many to this day.So, in the end, what do you have? A detailed catalog of a few fetishes and orientations, with some mildly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of a few sexual deviants before they are cured. For most of the film, the film moves with the crawling speed and mood of a wake. And, as an obviously low budget film, the cinematography and acting are not exactly top tier. Although I was pleased with the music, costume and interior design.I felt this films subject was right up my alley, and I still feel it is a below average film.

I will gladly watch the sequels multiple times but I am through sitting through this turkey, thanks to several characters.Well, let us start with the good news firstTHE GOOD  Plenty of action with a lot of wild animals on display, even if they are just stock footage. You see lion attacks, crocodiles, hippos, panthers, you name it, and you see several of the different tribes of all kinds, including pygmies called dwarfs in the movie. Since this movie was made almost 75 years ago, I cannot knock any of the realism because they did not have it in the movies that long ago. They do the best they can so you put up with actors talking in front of fake backgrounds. However, Weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape. He and OSullivan make a wellbuilt handsome couple, if there ever was one in those Golden Years of cinema.The film has historical value with so many sequels in that it shows how Tarzan acquired Jane and his beginnings of learning the English language.The BAD  From the moment Jane Parker is taken by Tarzan almost every scene with her is Maureen OSullivan in hysterics, shrieking and screaming scene after scene. It is enough to give you a headache and it ruins the film. Thankfully, she calmed down in the sequels, but not in this movie. The movie also does no favors for The Great White Hunter image as C.

The actors put a lot of passion into the numbers, but these numbers often did not connect with the film and felt like standalone music videos. And no effort was made to make the numbers sound as if they were happening right there in front of you, every single one sounds like its coming from a studio, essentially sucking all the life from the songs. Off the stage the performances were all dull and unrealized, especially Hudson, who essentially plays the same angry, strong she is stubborn and selfish black woman we have seen before. There was absolutely no depth to her character, nor any of the other female leads. Though I think the movie wants us to believe that Hudsons character faces hardship because of her weight, it is really her own refusal to do what is best for the team that lands her in trouble, making the end of the film totally meaningless. Hudsons Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. When she sang, she put forth emotion though it was often misplaced, but this was the writerdirectors fault, but when she was just acting, she did nothing to flesh out an already underwritten character. Eddie Murphys character is the only one with an arc, and he did a fine job, but still not Oscar worthy. The only actor who really brought something to the roll was Danny Glover, who took a small, relatively unimportant character and made something real out of it. There is nothing here to sink your teeth into, no drama or heart, or even laughs. The placement of the musical numbers was so bad that at times the movie almost seemed to be making fun of musicals instead of being one; the number when Hudson is arguing with the other girls is so longwinded if it had been any longer it could pass for a Family Guy skit.

Just a bunch of amateurs singing AT each other!Now, the first half hour was good, but I was irritated at how Eddie Murphys terrific raveup performances were truncated and interrupted by montages. Those were easily the best songs and best performances in the film. And the rise to the top portion of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any momentum. The remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless, rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting. It was also visually dull and included too many soundalike tunes.Condon did not try to turn any of the tunes into big show pieces as I would expected they would.

However, that is not to say that in the right cinematic hands it could not be fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile onscreen. Unfortunately, what transfers to the screen is basically a slavishly faithful version of the stage hit with all of its inherent weaknesses intact. First, the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor. There are lots of songs perhaps too many?, but few of them are especially memorable. The closest any come to catchy tunes are the title song and One Night Only  the much acclaimed And I Am Telling You That I Am Not Going is less a great song than it is a dramatic set piece for the character of Effie Jennifer Hudson. The film is slick and technically wellproduced, but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking in any resonance. There is some interest in the opening moments, watching Jamie Foxxs Svengalilike manager manipulate his acts to the top, but that takes a back seat in the latter portion of the film, when the story conveniently tries to cast him as a villain, despite his having been right from a business standpoint for a good majority of the film. Beyonce Knowles is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well, but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface glitz. Anika Noni Rose as the third member of the Dreamgirls trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film. Eddie Murphy acquits himself well as a singer obviously based on James Brown, but the role is not especially meaty and ultimately has little impact. Foxx would seem ideal casting, but he seems oddly withdrawn and bored. The films biggest selling point is surely former American Idol contestantOscar winner Jennifer Hudson in the central role of Effie White, the temperamental singer who gets booted from the group and makes a triumphant closing act return. For me, Effie has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie. The film obviously wants you to feel sorry for her and rather hamhandedly takes her side, but I have never been sure that this character deserves that kind of devotion. From the start, Effie conducts herself for the most part like an obnoxious, egotistical, selfcentered diva, who is more interested in what everyone else can do for her rather than having much vested interest in the group of which she is a part. When she is booted from the group for her unprofessionalism and bad attitude, the charges are more than wellfounded, but the stage showfilm seem to think Effie should be cut unlimited slack simply because she has a great voice. Even though the film tries to soften some of Effies harder edges to make her more likable, the charges still stand. Her story becomes more manipulative by suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she is an unwed mother struggling to raise her daughter  using the implication that much like the talent card motherhood immediately makes any behavior excusable. Indeed the only big effort the film makes to show Effies mothering is to tell us about it and then include a scene where she barks at her daughter in the unemployment office, insists that the girl has no father and then refuse to look for gainful employment to support them since singing is all she knows. In the hands of a skillful actress, the gaps could perhaps have been remedied with technique and charisma. Unfortunately, Hudson is not that actress. She sings well, but the dialogdriven moments do not come naturally to her nor do high emotional moments. Effies signature moment the aforementioned And I Am Telling You... number is wellsung by Hudson, but emotionally flat in the acting department. Effie is supposed to expressing her rage and desperation at her predicament, but Hudson comes off as a cabaret performer belting out a hot number. All in all, not quite the emotional highlight one expects. The latter portion of the film is basically a predictable melange of events that maneuver Foxx into Hudsons earlier position and allow her to strut back in and lord it over everyone. Foxxs criminal offenses in the film are undoubtedly par for the course of many struggling record producers, but the films seeming implication that he has it coming because he helped usher in the disco era is rather ridiculous, not to mention pretentious and condescending, particularly coming from a film with all of the depth of a puddle. The end result is a faithful rendition of the stage hit, drained of emotion, energy or anything that can be described as dynamic.","label":0},{"index":10737,"txt":"Yeah.

Unfortunately, they happen in the context of a movie that does not seem to have a clue what it is doing. During the first 4560 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance. Suddenly, about an hour in, the characters who, until this point, had always spoken to each other, suddenly start singing to each other. To further confuse things, a little further in, out of nowhere, they actually do about 15 minutes of sungthrough dialog, then seem to drop that idea and move on to other things, such as a number that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen string section. On top of all this inconsistency in how the music is used, is the composers clear inability to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed. While the first couple of pieces do sort of mimic the 1950s Motown sound, the rest of the film is just bad Broadway show music. Then there is the pure silliness of snippets of a group doing a bad Jackson family imitation and Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie.

He is in the film for about 15 minutes, and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason. I will not even explain the ending, because quite frankly I cannot make it out myself. But before the final scene, we are treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film. Honestly, they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all.All in all, stay away from this film. I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied. Like, playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly. That for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining.","label":0},{"index":10744,"txt":"Despite the excellent cast, this is an unremarkable film, especially from the aviation perspective. It may be somewhat better than the egregious von Richthofen and Brown but not by much.

It is interesting to speculate what ILM could do with Zeppelins and Gothas in a new, highquality WW I aero film.","label":0},{"index":10745,"txt":"Funny that I find myself forced to review this movie, but here I am.I am reviewing it, because just recently, I have had the chance to witness the revival of R.C. Sheriffs play Journeys End on stage in New York, at the Belasco Theatre, starring Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, as well as being masterfully directed by David Grindley.I left the theater shattered. I am not exaggerating, I was flabbergasted. After almost two and a half hours of a recreated and very claustrophobic depiction of soldiers life in the trenches of the Somme I speculate, during World War One, brought to life vividly, by everyone involved, I came out of the theater with the shakes.Mind you, I am not easily shocked, nor am I too sensitive. I am a stage actor and a director myself, so I know the buttons being pressed to achieve certain effects, both emotionally, as well as psychologically.But what I had just witnessed, came so much to life, that I had chills in my spine as I left.None of these emotions came to life, while watching Aces High, the movie based on this play and even adapted for the screen, in cooperation with R.C. Sheriff himself, shortly before he died.The screen adaptation takes place in the skies over France. So, gone is the claustrophobic ambiance to start with.The only plus of the movie, are the aerial battle scenes, which look dated in their special effects, compared to todays standards, but still very valid in the flying tactics adopted on screen.Granted there had been a couple of screen adaptations of All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque, which takes place in trenches, and not in the sky, but that was the German vision on things, if one would like to be picky on such things.Journeys End is just the other side of the medal, and would have made it into a great movie, if they had left it alone and intact.The transfer on DVD is poor, even though in Widescreen and adapted for 169 TV screens, the quality of the film itself is that of a movie theater. Nothing more, nothing less. It sports various defects, such as minor scratches and dots, although the copy, for the rest, is clean.If you want another WWI movie in your collection, especially for those who love and enjoy to see aerial battles among oldtimers, then this is a picture for you. But I rather would suggest Von Richthofen and Brown as an alternative, although that too, is a movie filled with inaccuracies.For the rest of you, who love good acting and drama, I would leave this one out. Buy the play. Go watch the play, if you have the chance to get a decent revival of it near you, but keep off this wouldbe adaptation.It is an antiwar movie, granted, but the weakest I have ever seen in my lifetime ever.The presence of actors such as Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud, is just a bluff, since they are just seen in very weak and very brief cameo roles throughout the movie.McDowell, the very talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, all deliver very weak performances, not due to their lack of skills, but rather due to lack of true and solid direction.There are too many gaps in it, and as said before, it drags itself to the dubious end. Dubious because in the original play, none of the men we come to know and sympathize with, stay alive. They are all killed in a fatal and futile mission. In the movie they all die, except Malcolm McDowell, who manages somehow to stay alive another day, being the wing commander of the unlucky bunch, just to receive another three pilots to fly and die for another lost cause.The end of the play leaves a bare stage in total darkness. You just hear the cannons roar, the machine guns rattle, and grenade impacts throughout the theater. Then, suddenly, total peace and silence. The curtain comes up. Lights. And here they all are. Lined up, standing straight and rigid. Obedient corpses...Far more interesting and far more shocking than Aces High finale, which is also dragged by the hair.It is up to you to judge.For me, if I had the money and the contacts to do so, I would take the play and develop it, the way it was meant. Adding here and there some action scene in the field, just to visualize the outer horror and slaughter going on in the vasty fields of France, around the men involved, but then, just strictly concentrating on what is going on, in that tiny shack at the edge of sanity and the world...Want such a movie?Then ask for it.This is not it.","label":0},{"index":10746,"txt":"Before I begin, I want to briefly say that this movie in and of itself is very well made and well acted by all involved, including Whittaker, who indeed deserves his nomination. It is highly entertaining, and . . . taken in the right context as a work of FICTION, it is a very good movie. For that, I give it the two stars.However, rather than wasting your time with what you can read a hundred times elsewhere, I want instead to point out the absolute fictional nature of this film and how dangerous it is to sell people a work of fiction as if it is truth. I stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, is a complete invention of fiction. Rather, it presents this character into a real historical setting, and allows the uninformed viewer to assume he was in fact real, and what they are seeing is the truth. I have no problem with the blending of fact and fiction  but to do so in such a dishonest matter is, in a word, reprehensible.There can be no doubt that Africa, along with most Third World Countries is rife with human misery and suffering. Hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film. But Hollywood also has its eye toward making money. The only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the West is to either experience it for yourself, or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary.But these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much. At the end of the day, they become less about presenting the facts for the viewer to decide for himself, and more about leading you from image to image and hitting you over the head screaming, SEE, WE TOLD YOU IT WAS BAD! The seminal example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the DVD after sitting through the movie. Arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of Kay Amin, Idis second wife, whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity. In the film, we see that her limbs have been severed and reattached in reverse arms for legs and viceversa. This is the director making sure you understand that Amin is, as the Gungans say, Bombad! But watching the documentary, we learn that this is in fact nothing more than a myth, which the sitting Minister of Health at the time himself tells us is not true.So . . . what . . . they just MAKE UP these things? Why? Because Hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence, that is why! They do not trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves. Look, that she was murdered and dismembered is in itself enough for us to conclude that Amin was not the likable guy he portrayed to the media  we do not need this Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE inspired imagery to reinforce that! And this is just the tip of the iceberg. What is also not explained to the casual viewer is that lead character Garrigan is himself fictional. There was no young Scottish doctor taken under Amins wing. As such, Garrigan is clearly present only for the sake of helping us dumb Westerners understand the African world. The producers seem to thing we will not be interested in a film about Africa unless there is a white face in it. Ironically, even the titular character is portrayed by an American black actor! The problem with this is that the movie is no longer an expose of Amin and his regime, but instead an exploitative thriller about a white Westerner coming to Africa for all the wrong reasons, making several horrible mistakes, and then redeeming himself, even at the cost of three other innocent lives. Honestly, I have to say it is nearly reprehensible to suggest that the real tragic death of Mrs. Amin was the result of a tryst with a fictional Scottish doctor  it almost seems to become a morbid joke for the sake of entertainment! I really wish Hollywood would stop jerking us around for our money. I first realized its propensity to do this with the woefully manipulative A BEAUTIFUL MIND, Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsmans sugarysweet adaptation of the life of John Nash, which deleted the darker side of the man to present only the tortured hero that America just cannot get enough of. The sad truth is that Hollywood has been selling us these fakes for years, and viewers, who are predictably and understandably too lazy or uncaring to investigate for themselves, buy these fake portraits hook, line, and sinker.Look, I am certainly not suggesting Amin is being turned into a villain he was not. My point is, with the truth being so shocking enough to convince us of the brutality of the man, why must Hollywood then go to such fictional lengths? Why must Hollywood continue to insult us by holding our hands through these films? Why can they not trust us to think for ourselves!? Can we not just put the honest portrayals on screen and let the audience decide for themselves? I urge all who continue to watch Hollywoods purportedly true movies to do yourself the favor of ALWAYS investigating for yourself, and to NEVER assume that what is on screen is even close to the truth!","label":0},{"index":10747,"txt":"Forest Whitakers performance is all the more impressive for making it almost worthwhile to sit through this dreck. Historical fiction does not justify changing history. The absurdity begins from the ground up with the imaginary lead character played by James McAvoy. To create a fictional observer for the purpose of giving the reader a point of connection in the book is regrettable, regrettable that white people cannot just read a book without a white protagonist to connect to, but at least he was placed in a somewhat passive role. Making up a fake historical actor and crediting this fiction with exposing Amin to the world is irresponsible, lazy and stupid. Not making the actions of this creation believable or even sane is just criminal, and has opened the door for movies like the one they are planning to make with Leonardo DiCaprio as a heroic Enron whistleblower who NEVER EXISTED. The logic of the world does not apply in this film where some Scottish kid thinks its okay to sleep with the wife of a murderous dictator. It does not apply where the wife of the dictator desires to sleep with some stupid scrawny irresponsible white boy. For that matter EVERYBODY is lined up to sleep with this scrawny, irresponsible, arrogant white boy, he even has Gillian Anderson licking her comely chops.Let me declare, I do not like James McAvoy. I am not sure what it is about him, but I thought his Mr. Tumnus in Narnia was creepy and pervy. I think that Kerry Washington would never look twice at him so I cannot believe that the wife of a powerful dangerous man like Amin would risk and lose her life for him. I do not believe him as a Doctor, and I just do not see the appeal. His character seems to have far more arrogance than would make sense, and trying to make him look like a badass in shooting the cow was just...there is that word again...absurd. Think about it, you are watching all of these characters bend themselves into knots in order to accommodate this unbelievable main character and there never was such a guy.Gillian Anderson looks incredible and sounds more British than most Brits. Whitaker gives a great expansive magnetic performance, and highlighted, with his incomprehensible preOscar speeches, just how much he was acting. It is a shame the film around him had no reason to exist.","label":0},{"index":10748,"txt":"This film can be judged from three viewpoints as history, as a profile of Amin, as a fictional thriller. It fails as history, it mentions in passing the coup that threw out Obote, the expulsion of the Asians, and has the Entebbe hijack as background, but not in any chronologically consistent time frame. As a profile of Amin it may have been interesting, because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good, and if this was a better film, he would get an Oscar. He got it  which proves the Oscar voters do not watch the films they vote on. It ignores relevant historical episodes in the novel, which observed Amin and the history of Uganda from the point of view of the doctor. It tells instead the fictitious story of the Scots doctor and his impossible love life from the point of view of Amin. But the story told is the one incident that Amin was probably innocent of. As a fictional thriller, there is no plot to hold it together. The beginning is taut  it takes cinematic liberties with the novel, but sets up the story. The character of the doctor is welldefined, but becomes lost in the second half of the film which suffers as a result.Why the doctor decides to stay in Kampala is badly explained  seduced by power? Why he befriends noone is strange. The character of the friend in the novel has been lost because the Scotsman has the affair instead of the black doctor  a ludicrous entanglement which does not seem even faintly believable, but allows the writers of the film to show the ferocity of Amin close at hand. The Man called Horse bit at the end is risible. Finally in 1971, Uganda drove on the left, not right, the number plates were three letters and two or three numbers  and where are the Equator tusks?! In short  if you have never heard of Amin, you may want to spend two hours watching this film to appreciate Forest Whitakers acting, but the last hour will bore you to confusion. If you know Uganda or have read the book  do not see the film  it will only depress you. And if you want to know why the doctor was so foolhardy  he was not.","label":0},{"index":10749,"txt":"Truly a disgusting, vile film, with only a small amount of real humour.The character of the father in particular is vulgar in the extreme intentionally so, obviously, and portrayed in the most pathetic, seedy manner.My wife and I found this film horribly upsetting, with absolutely no redeeming features at all.

Despite the tragic nature of a middleaged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing, manipulative father, it was incredibly lighthearted and fun to watch in practice. In my opinion, it is without doubt one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has my 10 out of 10 rating without reservation.This movie spinoff on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word. Hardly any of the essence of the TV show is transferred successfully onto film. This movie has a very dreary, depressing tone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions. Seeing Harold being beaten up in a pub and not in a comical way is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the TV series will not like this movie. The movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where Albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbour.The romance between Harold and Zita is completely out of tone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie ever bothered to watch the TV series. In the TV series, Harold always went after respectable girls, not strippers.Alberts reactions to the remarks made against him by Harolds girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the TV series. In the movie, Albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity rises.Most movie spinoffs of British sitcoms tend to be quite dull, with the notable exception of the ON THE BUSES films which in some respects were actually better than the TV series itself!. But, STEPTOE AND SON has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile, even below GEORGE AND MILDRED.My advice  skip this one and see the second spinoff, STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead.

For instance, would the young married Hindu housemaid from the local village have an affair with her married Englishman Master, knowing full well that discovery of the affair would likely mean utter social ostracization and shame if not mortal punishment? Unlikely, but still maybe. However, would the same young Hindu housemaid, in the conservative society of India of that era carry on like a half naked Britney Spears in heat, partake in hot outdoor sex during daylight in open view where they might be discovered at any moment?

Nor have I seen more celebrated works by the director, so my capacity to discuss Before the Rains outside of analysis of the film itself is mitigated. With that admittance, let me begin.Before the Rains is a different kind of movie that does not know which genre it wants to be. At first, it pretends to be a romance. In most romances, the protagonist falls in love with a supporting character, is separated from the supporting character, and is sometimes united with his or her partner. This movies hero has already won the heart of his lover but cannot be with her. His name is Henry Moores and her name is Sajani, and they reside in southern India during the waning days of the Raj British imperial rule. Henry has been away from London for a long time and has fallen in love with his married Indian maid, despite his legal marriage and child overseas. What could be better than that? They often sneak away for intimate afternoons until some children notice them. Word spreads to Sajanis husband who questions her involvement with Moores. She denies any contact with him, but Moores asks her to leave the area. Sajani refuses because of her devotion to him and commits suicide. Please take note that these events occur in the opening third of the film. The film changes tone and becomes a crimedrama in its final portions.Sajanis body is discovered right as Moores family comes to visit. The alleged perpetrator is Mooress Englisheducated assistant T.K. T.K. knows of his masters affair but keeps silent until his life becomes threatened. Once he is declared innocent, he attempts to regain his honor by killing Moores. T.K. is too squeamish and leaves him in a dirt path as the rains fall.I want to warn you, this is not a romance film. The DVD cover and theatrical posters show an Indian woman and Caucasian man embracing in an idealized tropic setting. This image is captured directly from the films opening, but quickly disappears. Then it is over. It seems like an effort to capitalize on Western fixation on forbidden love. It is not effective, at all. Not only is the movie not a romance, but its characters lack any personality. They are bundles of walking clich\u00e9s. Moores is an arrogant white man who does not recognize his Indian friend, T.K.s intelligence. T.K. is torn between his own heritage and his educative background. Sajani is a woman incapable of having a choice in her romantic life. Oh, and, of course, Moores family is inquisitive into Sajanis death but still slightly racist to Indians. If the tone was not so serious, I would be willing to overlook these problems, but it is not. The film is presented with a didactic overtone which highlights its poor character development.No, this film is not terrible. Other than the laughable screenplay, it is not poor. The actors are all experienced and perform well here. Nandita Das, who plays Sajani, was part of wonderful Indian drama Water. Even director Sivan has an impressive resume. He recently oversaw The Terrorist, which is part of Roger Eberts Great Movies collection. What happened here? Why is this movie so bad? Well, Sivan mentioned how he was inspired to direct this film because of a short he viewed in Israel called Red Roofs. Apparently, the story was timeless, and Sivan sought to create a similar experience set in 1930s India. I do not have any problem with that approach, but I think Sivan may have been too motivated this time. The actors, cinematography, and set design are acceptable but unless you share Sivans aura, you will probably not enjoy it.

Forget this and see if you can find a copy of A Chump at Oxford or Bohemian Girl or Sons of the Desert instead.","label":0},{"index":10764,"txt":"I can understand after watching this again for the first time in many years how it is considered one of the worst Laurel  Hardys. For me, it is not as close to as bad as Air Raid Wardens and The Bullfighters, but there are some definite huge flaws in it. The film is set up to show Laurel and Hardy as the owners and instructors of the dance studio. Hardy is funny as the prancing lead of a London Bridge dance, surrounded by 20th Century Fox starlets, while in the next room, Laurel teaches the beginners ballet while wearing a ballerina outfit. A clumsy carpenter spills glue on the floor, leading to a predicable gag where Hardy ends up the looser. Then, in come the racketeers, now selling insurance covering up their protection racket. One of them is a very young and handsome Robert Mitchum. But no sooner do they bully the boys into buying insurance, they are arrested.This is the end of the gangsters and the last time we see the dance studio. The rest of the film is devoted to Laurel and Hardys support of wealthy patron Trudy Marshall and her inventor boyfriend, Robert Bailey. They first try to help them hide their relationship from her disapproving parents Matt Briggs and Margaret Dumont and hopeful suitor Allan Lane, whom we can tell right off is a nogood swine. This leads to Briggs hidden bar being revealed to teatotaling Dumont, and a gag where a rug is literally pulled out from the wealthy patriarch which crashes his bed into a pond below. When Bailey uses the boys to help display his ray gun, pandemonium ensues. The deadpan butler announces to Case and Dumont that their house is on fire.Later, Hardy wants to use the insurance policy to gain money to pay their dance studio rent and hopes to get Laurel to break a leg to do so. There is no reference to the fact that the insurance salesmen were gangsters and that the policy would probably be invalid. Even if they were to have become legitimate insurance salesman, after being arrested, their licenses would have been revoked. Laurel ends up getting off a bus which had been abandoned by the driver over a supposedly rabid dog only a frosting covered, cake devouring Toto lookalike, or possibly the actual pooch, causing Oliver to end up on a huge beach rollercoaster that somehow the bus has ended up on, perfectly fitting its wheels onto the tracks. Rollercoaster gags can be exciting, as evidenced in Abbott and Costello Go to Hollywood, and this one is amusing but anticlimactic.As the story wraps up, all of these gags seem to have no point, giving the impression that this was simply a series of onereelers put together to make a fulllength feature, hopefully part of a double bill. LH, as I have mentioned in other reviews of their later films, had lost much of their luster after leaving Hal Roachs employ, but surprisingly here, they do not come off as old and tired looking as they had in films made in the same year. Had the gags not been as amusing, as was the case with some of their other films, this surely would have ranked a 2 as opposed to a 3.","label":0},{"index":10765,"txt":"A BDSM subculture of Los Angeles serves as backdrop for this low budget and shabbily constructed mess, plainly a vanity piece for its topbilled player, Celia Xavier, who also produces and scripts while performing a dual role as twin sisters Vanessa and Celia. A question soon develops as to whether or not some rather immoderate camera, lighting and editing pyrotechnics can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensate viewer. Celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the County of Los Angeles, while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon CDROMS, but when disaster befalls Mistress Vanessa, virtuous Celia, determined to unearth her sisters vicious attacker, begins a new job as a sex slave at the private Castle Club where the specialty of the house is a dungeon party. Two FBI field agents whose deployment to the Vanessa case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet BDSM sites, in addition to a Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective, are assigned to investigate the crime, while endeavouring to provide security for Celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her. Flaws in logic and continuity abound, such as a homicide being allocated to L.A.P.D.s OperationsSouth Bureau, a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film. Direction is unfocused and not aided by erratic postproduction editing and sound reproduction. The mentioned photographic gymnastics culminate with a batty montage near the movies end of prior footage that is but tangentially referent to the scenario. One solid acting turn appears among this slag Stan Abe as a zealous FBI agent.","label":0},{"index":10766,"txt":"For those fans of Laurel and Hardy, the 1940s and beyond were a very sad time for the team. Their contracts with Hal Roach Studios had expired and now they were free agentsable to work for any studio who offered them a job. Unfortunately, Fox, RKO, MGM without Roach and even a French film company who hired the boys had absolutely no touch for their comedic talents. Plus, Stan and Ollie were a lot older and seeing these geriatric men taking pratfalls seemed sad, not particularly funny. Stan looked very ragged and Ollies weight had ballooned up to the point where he could barely walkand so it made me feel uncomfortable laughing at their very, very sedate antics.In addition to their age, this particular film suffers because Fox Studios oddly cast them in a supporting role and created a parallel plot involving a young couplesomething that reduced their time on screen AND turned them into insipid hangers on instead of just being themselves. A cute and cuddly Stan and Ollie is very foreign to the old Laurel and Hardy of the 20s and 30sand just seemed awfully strange and suited them poorly.Now even with their age, this COULD have been a decent movie if it had been given decent writing and if it appeared the studio caredand it is quite obvious they were using the B unit herewith, at best, second class support. In particular, there are very few laughs and the last 10 minutes of the film is simply dreadfulrelying exclusively on a sloppy rearprojected screen for the stupid chase scenewhich might just rank as one of the worst of its kind in film history.For mindnumbed zombie lovers of Laurel and Hardy, it is probably a film they will love. But, for lovers of the team who are willing to honestly evaluate this film relative to their amazing earlier films, it simply comes up wanting indeed. In fact, of all their fulllength films pre1940, I cannot think of one I liked less than DANCING MASTERS. Unfortunately, of the post1940 films, this might just be one of their better ones. Sadly, it got a lot worsewith wretched films like THE BIG NOISE and NOTHING BUT TROUBLE. I just wish the boys had just retired after SAPS AT SEA.Finally, I wonder if all the generally positive reviews for this film on IMDb might reflect the reviewers love of the team more than it is an indication that this is a good film? For an audience who are NOT already in love with the team, I do not know HOW this film will do anything but bore the audienceit certainly Will not convince anyone that Laurel and Hardy were comedic geniuses. But even comedic geniuses need material worthy of their talents.","label":0},{"index":10767,"txt":"This movie was long and boring. Surprising that it was selected for Cannes, although they tend to like pretentiousness. Point is that contrary to other Dutch stars of the arty genre like Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels utterly empty. Even more so it has no cinematic quality whatsoever. A long opening shot does not mean cinematic depth, it is just a long boring shot. The story was not interesting and the characters had problems I could not identify with at all. The actors did not shine under her direction and seemed lost at times. Leopold tried, but she is not the talent I hoped she would be. Where are Kerkhof and Kruishoop?

Leopold just made another attempt.","label":0},{"index":10768,"txt":"GUERNSEY Maria Kraakman  BelgiumNetherlands 2005.The mousy Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties, who finds out her husband Fedja van Huet is cheating on her but she does not dare to confront him. She painfully avoids any confrontation with human beings, her parents as well as her sister, so we have a main character in a feature film that does not do much at all. We barely know anything about her background or her motivations. Just a woman who seems to be stuck in a blind alley, not just during this difficult episode of her life. She obviously suffers from something, but why do we in the audience have to suffer as well?I almost gave up on cinema after seeing this unwatchable mess. These were a very dull and painful 90 minutes. Normally I try to avoid wasting energy on bad film making. I will take the beating and roll with the punches, but in this case a fair warning is in place. How on earth did Nanouk Leopold get funding in large part from publicly financed funds for this turkey? Obviously, there was no script to speak off. It could be compensated by an ingenious filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or a cast with only a little more appeal. None whatsoever, just a vaguely defined concept, I want to do something from a womans point of view. The result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life.To make things worse, there is not an interesting shot to be found in the entire film. I cannot think of a cast who could have spiced this one up, but Johanna ter Steege is a small light in the dark, if possible with this dire lack of material. I am trying to imagine how Leopold tried directing Maria Kraakman Maria, look at the horizon, we will film you for three minutes, just express sadness. A perfect cure for insomnia.

She has been with her husband Sebastiaan for years and they do not talk so much anymore. While on a working visit abroad, a female colleague commits suicide. Anna is deeply impressed by her death, even though she hardly knew her. Nobody seems to know why she took her own life. For the first time Anna realizes that one can be an unknown among your most dearest. Anna does not mention the incident back home and starts observing her husband and child. Guernsey is the story of a woman who suddenly starts looking at her own life. And she wonders how she got so drifted apart from the people closest to her.This is my translation of the DVD cover text synopsis. I hope you find it useful, as this movie does not have an IMDb Plot Summary yet at this date.","label":0},{"index":10770,"txt":"This film uses all arthouse clich\u00e9s slow pace, long static shots, minimal amount of dialog to try to hide the fact that there really is nothing worth watching here There is no plot to speak of, the characters are dreary female lead or clich\u00e9 Tersteeghe is character, and they do not ever talk to each other about anything that concerns their rather uneventful lives. The film is centered around a woman who finds out about her husbands adultery. Instead of confronting him, she halfheartedly takes revenge by committing adultery herself. After a fight and a reconciliation with her sister  who knew about the adultery without telling her  she asks her husband to stop cheating on her. They seem to be reunited as a family. Two other story lines  the planned move of the womans elderly father with his young wife to Guernsey and the rivalry with the womans sister  do not offer any interesting developments. The suicide of a colleague of the woman that seems to set off events in the film is not a subject in itself. For 2005  or any other year for that matter  this is not enough to make an interesting film.Moreover, what little possibilities for dramatic development there are in the script are not used or are consciously avoided, as when both the woman and her sister mark a particular piece of furniture from their fathers house which is going to be sold because of his planned move. Both sisters want this particular piece and given their rivalry in the past  over much more important things than furniture men  this could in theory lead to a confrontation. Or the matter could be resolved by one sister giving way to the other. Either way, this would not be a very interesting or original development of the story but at least it would constitute some development. The film clearly sets this situation up with both sisters looking intently at each other during the marking and one sister having mentioned she does not want to draw straws but it cheats us out of any resolution the scene simply ends and how this  in itself rather dreary and materialistic  issue is solved, is not shown. Although almost completely absent, the dialog that is in the film is excruciatingly flat and tepid. For example, when during a visit to Guernsey, the 2 sisters address their rivalry it is in a three line dialog that has a childish yes it is  no it is not ring to it. The fight and reconciliation scene with the 2 sisters is completely without dialog  giving a highly artificial, overly stylised and unrealistic impression and considerably reducing its impact. The way the woman finally  finally!  addresses her husbands adultery in a single line of dialog has to be seen to be believed  and is at the same time completely unbelievable. The husband does not seem to have any noticeable reaction or if he has any, it is not shown. The woman does not mention her own adultery to her husband. The scene showing the woman, husband and their young son asleep on an airliner, watched by the sister is possibly meant as a happy end, but the way the characters addressed the issues of their lives in what went before makes this unlikely.Because of its slow pace, uninteresting story, leaden direction and absurd lack of dialog, I found this film an example of everything that can be wrong with an arthouse movie and a complete waste of time.","label":0},{"index":10771,"txt":"For me every piece of art is to be judged by these criteria Form, Function and Meaning. Guernsey seems to be dedicated to forms nice shots and sometimes interesting acting. The long close ups suggest a function that the viewer may fill in by himself. Because of lacking texts the story becomes a quiz. An introvert person suggests to have depth, but sometimes it turns out he has nothing to say. This film acts like an introvert person. If you have not read the synopsis you cannot see that it was the suicide and the unanswered question Why? that changes Annas view on life and makes her suspicious. Why do not you speak to me? asks Sebastiaan. Anna does not answer, she only starts looking a long time at him without saying a word. What is the function of that shot? What does it mean? My question is like Sebastiaans What has this film to say? What is meant by this movie? The answer for me It shows us a handful of persons with the passion of a glass of water. The story of their lives is simple and boring. Motives behind their actions are not shown. The rest is skins, residences, landscapes. Nice and artistic done, but meaningless without having disposal of instructions for use. In my opinion this film is made for fellow artists, not for the common viewer.","label":0},{"index":10772,"txt":"Definitely the worst movie I have ever seen...

Not to say about the dreamlike insertion about Dracula... just another expedient, drawn from the worst cabaret tradition, to make this film last a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can, but this socalled movie was really too, too hard to rescue. I would have given it 010, but the lowest mark was 110 and so I had to overestimate it by one mark.","label":0},{"index":10773,"txt":"I do not know what I missed here, but I cannot believe all these positive comments by so many people on this film. I thought it was silly, and a bit over the top. I did like the performances of Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker, however the others were just... boring.Now I like B movies, I really do, but this was a bit further down the alphabet for me. I saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to Army Of Darkness and Shaun of the Dead, as well as On par with The ReAnimator. You must be joking. I did not find this film funny, it tried, it did make an effort, possibly too much of an effort, but it failed in my opinion. By the time I was hit with the 3rd or 4th oneliner I was rolling my eyes and checking my watch.There were definitely homages made to several other films, which is always cool, kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans. But here it may have just been a lack of original thought. Admittedly there were some nice special effects, good gore, but that cannot carry an entire movie. The mutated Grant looked like a cross between Jabba the Hut, and in the early stages of mutation Chet from Weird Science after he was turned into the monster and one of the alien creaturechildren from The Explorers. It just did not work. I thought it looked like something some kid from Grade 5 art class could have designed. Then there was Brenda, the woman that Grant impregnated and chained up in the barn. When help finally arrived she looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped. The design once again was totally unimaginative. A round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle. yawn Now about the zombies The more movies I see with zombies in them these days the more I wish George A. Romero had a patent on them and was the only writerdirector allowed to make movies about them. He is the only person so far to do it right, with the exception of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg but that was a comedy. Oh, and Danny Boyle, but they were a different style of Zombie. Maybe Mr. Romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan, groan and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid, and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were reanimated. The people of Wheelsy just did not have the proper motivation... they were horrible zombies.So in the end I give Slither a 3, for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes.","label":0},{"index":10774,"txt":"Slither is a horror comedy that does not really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other. It has one scene that is exceptionally good, any number of zingers that work, but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie. In addition, the script does not focus on the hero and heroine, and goes off kilter in several places.A major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero Fillion to follow Grant Grant Michael Rooker as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster. This whole part of the film drags  Michael Rookers character is not that interesting to us as a person, and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monsters interest might be interesting if this was Grant  Portrait of a Man Turning Into A Monster rather than a horrorcomedy alien invasion movie. In the final analysis this movies problems are in the script  it is not that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates. The purpose of a horrorcomedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them, with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens. Instead we get an exploration of the aliens habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag. The ostensible heroine Elizabeth Banks as Starla Grant is more central to this part, but nonetheless I felt the movie had left its narrative track, unless it planned on following Grant Grant all the way to the end.When Fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook, but once again the problem is in the script. By this point that audience knows  and the characters should know  that Grant is not just suffering from some disease, and act accordingly shotguns  instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that let us get you to a hospital is going to help. Although their reactions might have been human and real, these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised  delivered action. A lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing. SPOILERS AHEAD  After the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie the script once again betrays the movie. At this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien. The writerdirector Gunn chooses as this character a completely new character, rather than one of already developed minor characters. Why? Why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot? By the time this character is attacked, we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her, even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath. Had Gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters, he could have completely avoided introducing her family, and saved time and money. Furthermore, the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the aliens plans without all the additional characters, and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigor.My last criticism is based on the movies look. Gunn is primarily a writer, or maybe it was budgetary constraints, but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting. Most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field, and the screen simply looks drab. The sets in Wheelsy the fictional town where the action takes place look cheap. The whole movie looks cheap. Box Office Mojo states the films budget was 15 million, newspapers say 29 million, and considering they did not use any name talent, I would say the money did not show up on screen. The monster is just repulsive, and rarely looks deadly.The last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the characters actions. By the time Fillion and Co have begun hunting Grantthe alien, one woman has disappeared and Grant is known to have been mutilating animals. At this point I was expecting the FBI or at least the State Police to show up and take over from the hick Sheriff. A woman has disappeared and likely been murdered, and a local has been acting psychotic. Time to call the authorities. But basically I was hoping that would happen because I just wanted some characters who would show up and ACT.Although this movie is ostensibly a horrorcomedy, the movie it bears the most resemblance to is Dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions. Whereas Dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story especially the entire Morgan Freeman subplot and particularly the ending, in many ways it was stronger, primarily because the main characters were stronger, but more importantly because it looked beautiful. Although that may be anathema  preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values  that just shows you how uninteresting I found the look of Slither.","label":0},{"index":10775,"txt":"what a preposterous story ,murder blackmail,child sex allegations ,gays and the catholic church.....absolute tripe.

The only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brothers death by monkeys being strongly featured on the DVD cover, the act itself is never directly portrayed.

The plot is extremely contrived; Govind kept losing the vial so many times in obscure accidents his friend just happens to mix up the vial with a package he was sending to India, a crazy old lady just happens to throw the vial into an idol, half the cast just happens to unexpectedly meet up in the same hospital, and the case with the idol just happened to get mixed up with one that belonged to a famous singer.CGI Oh god, the CGI. It was even worse than the special effects in Jaws 3, and those sucked. Right away, I could tell which parts were animated. Even my tenyearold cousin knows that underwater cars do not look like that. Stunts Yes, I now that action scenes in Tamil movies are not realistic, but the stunts in this one were horrid and actually distracted me from the story.Make up I have to admit, they did a better job than expected. I thought Kamal would be playing people with similar skin tones, so the two fake white guys and the fake Japanese Aikido guy caught me off guard. However, it was still pretty bad, I could easily tell which ones were wearing masks.The songs The music was distracting and outofplace in many instances.Asin Her character was possibly the most annoying one in the movie. She was loud, ditsy, and obsessed irrationally about that idol. I actually found myself wishing she would die.Plot holes and Fridge Logic Let me get this straight a lab monkey was smart enough to get past a passwordlocked door, but not intelligent enough to tell the difference between a bar of chocolate and a vial with a deadly virus in it. And then, an exCIA agent who is after the vial figures out it is headed for India. Instead of immediately following it, he marries a pole dancer first. A famous Punjabi singer with cancer checks into a small town hospital in the third world when he could easily afford the best medical treatment available. Furthermore, he gets shot in the throat with a bullet. You would think he would be killed, but instead, the magic bullet has cleared his tumor. You read that right, a BULLET knocked out the tumor.

The plot construction is awkward to say the least  the modern day programmer is a dull onenote character, but half the movie is spent setting up her character, and then when Ada finally appears, it is to narrate the events of her life, not to present an engaging story Swinton almost pulls this off, though.

The programmer successfully contacts a person in the past! Astonishing! But it hardly seems to surprise anyone, and her boyfriend says, Well, be careful. Although we are given no clue then or later why it might be dangerous, and it never seems to actually be dangerous.Also, despite being about computers and Ada Lovelace and her love of mathematics, it is clear no one involved with the script had any knowledge of mathematics OR computers  any references to these subjects come across as complete mumbo jumbo that defies any suspension of disbelief.One scene, towards the end of the movie, is quite good, a monolog by Tilda Swinton expressing her sadness at the fragility of life but her joy in that life.

Newcomer Francesca Faridany seems talented, but is wasted as Emmy, a character who by midfilm is reduced to nothing more than staring at a monitor watching Lady Ada narrate an autobiography. Conceiving Ada takes off briefly when Lady Ada Tilda Swinton appears; the camera lingers on her facial expressions, mannerisms, even making her appear to be translucent or momentarily invisible, apporting into scenes to dramatize Emmys virtual rendering of her.A straightforward biopic of Ada Lovelace would have been worthwhile, but this film unfortunately makes a hash of both Lady Adas life, and that of a modernday computer scientist and her broadlydrawn, doltish boyfriend.","label":0},{"index":10823,"txt":"If you make it through the opening credits, this may be your type of movie.

This hits a sore spot with me, as I have long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to glom onto and awfully misuse science terms and ideas to the point of confusion, eg Emmy Coer information waves have a halflife, Ada I am not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all.This movie does worse than fail to entertain  it misinforms. The only redeeming value I can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it so badly distorts.

So, if there is any such thing as a target audience for this film, then I guess I would probably be included in that.Maybe I just need to watch it again. A previous reviewer mentioned not to watch this film whilst being tired. Maybe that was my mistake.I tried my best to enjoy this film, and there are aspects of it that I do like, but overall I found it amateurish and quite plodding.Being somewhat of a self confessed computer nerd, I just cannot help but pick up on the exact time frame when the movie was actually made, and how the employed graphics reflect that time i.e. 1997. Having played games of the era c.f. Mind Grind to cite one example, this film cannot escape that 16bit colour low res multimedia explosion of that time. Now thankfully this has somewhat lessened in more recent years in the gaming world at least, in favour of actual game play.Having to resort to watching this movie via a German FTA satellite channel as I do not think it is ever been aired on UK FTA TV, well not recently anyway, I was mildly amused to see the end credits note Gottdog God dog had 4 people working on it is design. Maybe it is mean spirited of me to be amused by this, given that ten years have elapsed since the movie was made, nevertheless the end result makes movie graphics from the eighties look good by comparison.But, as for the main story, I agree that the format is not the best idea. Like others I agree that Ada deserves a film without the scifi angle, and a more straightforward biographical approach would perhaps be better suited to covering the life story of this remarkable lady.There are fundamental mistakes that undermine my enjoyment of this movie. First of all the underlying idea that somehow lost realworld information from the past can be accurately reconstructed through some sort of extrapolation via software based intelligent agents, seems somehow ludicrous.Also, the theme running through the movie that a computing device can indeed predict the mechanics of all things through the course of time e.g. the winds is now known not to be the case.OK, so the Victorians may have held this view, but the 20th century works of G\u00f6del proving that no mathematical system can be complete, Turings works on the limits of computability, not to mention chaos theory and quantum mechanics, have all completely undermined these ideas, which seem central to how the modern day researchers software is supposed to work.Finally, the clicking of the mouse in the air to mean programming is also just plain wrong, as previously mentioned.This film maybe could have been OK, but at least some technical and scientific consultation would have given the film some much needed credit in the believability stakes.I will not forget the film though, as like Pi, it is clearly a unique work, but with too many fatal mistakes for me to truly enjoy it, 310 from me.","label":0},{"index":10827,"txt":"Have you ever seen a movie made up entirely of long wide shots? No? Me, neither. Well, I have finally seen one in Spring in my Hometown, and I must confess, now I KNOW why people do not do this. The technique is arty, to be sure, but it is definitely NOT ripe for public consumption. The technique is heavily flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and perhaps that might be the directors whole intentions. I do not know, I cannot read minds, and I certainly do not know enough about the director to make a judgement.But one thing about this movie that IS painfully obvious is its ridiculous antiAmerican sentiments. As an American, I am well aware of my countrys participation in the Korean War, and I am very well aware that we were not always angels, but I will be damn if I will take this guys version of how things happened. According to this blind fool, Americans were not only at the root of the war, we were the CAUSE of the war, and we almost singlehandedly destroyed the country. Whatever, Mister Director. And I suppose you would still be making this film in COMMUNIST KOREA if we had not interfered, right? Talk about forgetting your history. This is almost akin to making the Nazis the good guys while turning the Allied forces into the bad guys.

It may be that I am just a stupid American, but I really just do not get 400 Blows. Everything I have read about this movie has been a total rave, but I just could not stay interested. I am sure that it was as revolutionary in filmmaking as all the critics say, but when it boils right down to it, it is just really really boring. Maybe it is the language barrier, may I am just not sensitive or artsy enough, but whatever the case is, I hated this movie. The story itself is not bad; it is about a young French boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers, and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility. That in itself ought to be interesting, and it was, at first. There was nothing wrong with the dialogue, but then again it is hard to say because half of the conversations were not subtitled and for no apparent reason, so I did not always know what was going on. But for the dialogue we could understand, it made enough sense. The actors were believable enough, but it is hard to say what a real person would do in these situations. So you feel for the main character, but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think, well that sucks. The plot is not even your typical plot. Each time he gets in trouble, he gets into more trouble than the last time, but the reasons never vary too much. And through the entire film you realize that there is nothing the main character can really do about it. So it is more like just waiting to see how it ends. The ending, by the way, was completely over my head. It is way too artsy for me, and I just did not get it. Leading up to the end was easy enough to follow. The structure was certainly there, and it made sense as well, but everything was really drawn out. For the amount of dialogue and significant moments, the movie could have been an hour shorter. It just did not end. Part of it was the unnecessarily long shots, none of which were especially memorable; for example, the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds. Now, I am sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere, but for the average viewer, I would rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time. Or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running, like doing my laundry, or taking a nap. Final Verdict The feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson, if I could only get what the director was trying to say by his\u0085 unique decisions.

I have not felt this disappointed in watching a movie, let alone a documentary, in quite some time.I am a BIG fan of the Walking With... series, including it is Nigel Marvin spinoffs, for all their gleeful fun yet informative information. And although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures, the subject is still interesting and unique to explore.

It had a terrible flow, was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place, horrible effects that includes the few moments of CGI and especially the makeup effects, and overused MTVstyle camera effects.Speaking of the makeup effects, one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a 70s maninsuit horror movie. Well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous. None of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions.The worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way, or looks remotely real. It does not even look like it was taken seriously. It also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had. Remember the episode in Walking With Dinosaurs of the fate of the Ornithochirus sp?? That episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time I watch it. It is this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all. When you are more engaged in the subject and it is own personal story, even one that is just speculation, you care more about the facts surrounding it.The only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration at least in the BBC version I saw and the music. Otherwise, DO NOT bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh which I did frequently, but usually followed by rolling eyes.

I had high expectations of the movie, because of the rating. The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie. I have a couple main points for not liking this movie. SPOILERS 1. The casting. Jack Nicholson barely fits into Jack Torrences character. Also, I would have NEVER picked Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I pictured Wendy much differently. I can see why they picked Jack Nicholson though, the grin, the pointy eyebrows, but he is not supposed to really look evil. He is supposed to look normal, and he turns evil. Also, they make one of the worst movie couples. Danny was alright, he needed more life though. He acted way to droney.2. The screenplay. They cut out so many things that were in the book, and added things. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted, changed, or handled wrongly. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to seeing the hedge animals, the roque mallet, the elevator were not in the movie, and it was 2 and half hours!! I was extremely irritated.3. The Ending. The ending was changed completly, Halorann died, Jack froze to death, Wendy never got hurt...The Overlook did not blow up. The Ending was so cool in the book, and the movie messed it up so horribly, I was apalled. Hallorann was never supposed to die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least have Jack use a roque mallet. You never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie.There are other things that I did not like about the movie, but there are things that were all right. The camera angels were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator did not happen in the book was cool, but maybe I was too irritated that the movie did not go with the book, to try to be scared at all. I reccomend reading the book, before you see this movie. I applaud Stephen King for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis Stanley Kubrik any more. I would never have done that, I would have taken all the rights I could get to yell at him all day.

If you ever needed proof that musicians cannot talk, this is the film for you. Repeated attempts at profundity stumble over themselves to end up in monosyllabic comments delivered in awestruck voices Wow. Thank you, Idris Muhammed. This film is pretentious but, while much of the pontificating from Youssou NDour and his gang of merry men and one token woman grates, the music saves the day.The main idea behind the film what I take to be the main idea, dredged out of the inarticulate commentary is interesting. To gather a group of musicians from America and Europe and take them on a journey through the different styles of music that grew up in and out of slavery, back to their roots in the music of West Africa, and a concert in the old slave fort of Gor\u00e9e off the coast of Senegal. We are treated to gospel, blues, jazz and variations of these, including some fantastic drumming both in New Orleans and Senegal. There is also a good deal of NDours own compositions.Sadly, that is another weakness. It is never entirely clear what NDour himself wants to achieve. To some degree, the film appears to be an exercise in selfpromotion on NDours part. He wants to play his own music, jazzed up to some degree and performed in the company of a bunch of musicians he admires. He is clearly a little embarrassed by this and early in the film obtains the blessings of the Curator of the Gor\u00e9e museum.The clash between the different agendas shows through in several other places. For example, somebody obviously felt that it was not possible to tell the story of black music without involving a gospel choir, but NDour and most of his mates are Moslems a point made repeatedly throughout the film. The whole early sequence involving the black Christians is uncomfortable and then they disappear from the story until the close harmony group the only black Christians who can hold a tone? turn up in Dakar at the end of the film. To be fair, they turn up triumphantly and perform the best piece in the film. If the story of black music needs to nod in the direction of gospel, why not also in the direction of Latin America? Where are the black musical influences from the Caribbean and Brazil? Samba? Reggae? Then there is Europe. Here the black diaspora does not seem to have produced any musicians of calibre, since NDour chooses to draft in Austrian guitarist and a trumpet player from Luxemburg. Are they in the team just because NDour has played with him before? What I personally found most irritating, though, was the long sequence which tried to recreate a kind of 60s beatnikblack powerNation of Islam cultural happening in the New York home of Amir Baraka a.k.a. Leroi Jones. Hearing people talk about the importance of knowing your history, and then in the next breath perpetuating ignorance. Why do so many AfricanAmericans believe that taking an Arabic name is an assertion of their African roots? And why do they think Arabic Islam is so much more admirable than European Christianity? Who do they think established the trade in African slaves in the first place? The film does not have much to say about the situation in West Africa today beyond the platitude that present conditions are a consequence of all the brightest and best having been shipped away for 300 years. The Senegalese appear to be a poor but happy, musical gifted folk, friendly and welcoming, respectful of their elders and not above fleecing the visiting Americans in the fish market. Is this ethnic stereotyping or just my imagination? There is no comment on the armed guard that NDour and the camera crew seem to need in the opening sequence as they walk through the streets of Dakar.There is also a strong implication in the film that the slaves who were taken from Dakar came from Dakar. The similarity between the folk drumming style of New Orleans and the folk drumming style of Senegal is cited in evidence. The last thing the slaves heard before they were shipped away was the drumming of their homeland, bidding them farewell. Except, of course, that by and large, the slaves shipped from Dakar did not come from Dakar. They were captured or traded from the interior by the coastal Senegalese and sold to merchants of whichever European power currently held the Gor\u00e9e slave fort. The people of Dakar are not the descendents of Africans who escaped the slave trade, they are just as likely \u0096 more likely \u0096 to be descendents of the people who sold their black brethren into slavery and exile.The two agendas clash again in the final part of the film. There are two separate endings. On the one hand, the concert which NDour and Co have been rehearsing and preparing along the way and which they deliver in the courtyard of the Gor\u00e9e slave fort. The other end comes when the Harmony Harmoneers sing the spiritual Return to Glory, in the seaward doorway of the slave fort. This is deeply moving, even if it is hard to believe the performance is quite as spontaneous as it appears.This is a film that is flawed. Unclear of the story it is trying to tell and tugged in different directions. Irritating, confusing, beautiful and emotional by turns. Watch it listen to it for the music and the feeling, but do not expect enlightenment or intellectual rigour.","label":0},{"index":10860,"txt":"Oh, man!

To my great disappointment, this movie not only does without Lee, but it does without Frankensteins Monster altogether! Was it a case of If we cannot get Lee, we will not have a monster at all? Why would they do that? The monster is half the fun of the whole thing!! This film is dedicated solely to the study of Baron Frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain transplants before ending up in an asylum. I found the script extremely weak, with the need to suspend disbelief forced upon the audience a little too much. I am willing to suspend a fair amount, but this movie got fairly ridiculous, which took me out of the film rather than immersing me in it.Peter Cushing, though, is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film. For being one of the most beloved actors and notoriously sweet men, he sure could play menacing and malevolent extremely well. The supporting cast is competent, but has little to do, even the young doctor and his fianc\u00e9e blackmailed into helping Frankenstein. A bumbling police chief is introduced, along with his putupon sidekick, to generate some comic relief, then they are completely dropped from the movie! Why? We are led to believe that the police chief will be the main nemesis of the Baron, then we are led to believe it will be the young doctor, and then it ends up being the victim of Frankensteins brain transplant experiment. There was no tension, we were not invested in the creature, and the ending was left so ambiguous as to leave one unsatisfied because it is so clear they are setting up another sequel.Also, there are virtually no horror elements. Yes, there is a beheading in the beginning offcamera, and we are treated to the sounds of Cushing cutting the tops of two mens skulls off again, off camera, and there is the most unsettling and thoroughly unnecessary rape scene 90 of which is, again, offcamera. I understand that there is a love of letting the audience imagine it all, for their imaginations are far worse than what we can show, but come on, if you are not going to give us a Monster, then at least let us SEE the few horrific elements you do choose to include. Showing us a skeleton in the lab lit with a green light is just not scary.On top of a weak script, I thought the directing was mostly flat. There were a couple of nice shots, but otherwise no excitement, atmosphere, or suspense was generated. The same director did Curse back in 1958 and I thought it was brilliantly directed...guess he was as uninspired by this film as I was.The movie gets a 4 out of 10 from me strictly for Peter Cushings powerful, nuanced performance...beyond that, I found little in this movie worth recommending.

She quit the movies and, I think, joined the Board of Directors at MGM. That was a good move on her part. Her Cardboard Lover was talky and boring in parts. It was obvious there were only a handful of actors with speaking parts so they had a lot of dialogue to speak to keep this turkey afloat. The story was a good idea about a wealthy woman Norma Shearer hiring a man Robert Taylor to make her playboy fiancee George Sandersjealous. I am surprised that the director, George Cukor, did not cut many of the talky scenes between Ms. Shearer and Mr. Taylor. Mr. Cukor served Ms. Shearer well in The Women but not in this movie. The best performance in the movie was given by Robert Taylor. During Mr. Taylors career, he was given his best comedy roles in this movie and When Ladies Meet in 1941. In 1942, he gave his best comedy performance in Her Cardboard Lover and, up to then, his best dramatic performance in Johnny Eager. He had a busy year. I think of all the actors at MGM, Mr. Taylor worked with all the major and minor actresses on the lot. Also, MGM gave Mr. Taylor all types of movies to make  most of them were successful. That is why MGM kept him for 25 years. Mr. George Sanders was very good as a socialite heel. He played a similar role eight years later in All About Eve for which he won an Oscar for a supporting role. As for Ms. Shearer, this was one of her worst performances, she was not funny and too dramatic for this comedy. It is strange that she made a great comedy in 1939, The Women, and gave her best performance. It was obvious that she was too old looking for her younger leading men in Her Cardboard Lover. Also, it did not help that some of her clothes were awful.Too bad she and Mr. Taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together, the superb Escape. The same comments about this movie can be said of another movie, Personal Property that Mr. Taylor made in 1937 with Jean Harlow. It was too talky, boring, and the actress looked old. Ms. Harlow looked ill throughout the movie and nobody in Hollywood noticed to tell her to see a doctor, so in 1937, she died at age 26. What a waste!

Finally, at the Palm Beach casino Shearer frequents, Taylor proclaims I love you! Shearer brushes him off, as she is engaged to George Sanders as Tony. However, to settle a gambling debt, Shearer hires Taylor to pose as Her Cardboard Lover, to make Mr. Sanders jealous.This films title invites the obvious and appropriate threeword review Her Cardboard Movie. It is most notable as the last film appearance for Shearer, one of the biggest stars in the world from He Who Gets Slapped 1924, playing another Consuelo to The Women 1939. To be fair, this was likely the kind of Shearer film MGM believed audiences wanted to see. However, the part is unflattering.Plucked and powered, Taylor and Shearer were better off in The Escape 1940. If Shearer had continued, she might have become a better actress than leading lady; apparently, she was no longer interested, and certainly did not need the money.

The machinations of one half of a pair of husbandwife, exhusbandexwife to get the other back at the threat of marriage to another, divorce, or an eventual separation by means of jealousy, humiliation, or other schemes had been done much better in classics such as HIS GIRL Friday and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY. Both of these movies features women with a strong, indomitable screen presence and who played independent, protofeminist characters. In both movies, both women were estrangeddivorced from their witty first husbands and set to marry colorless men who were their exact opposite, and both would be bamboozled into rejecting their soontobe husbands and reigniting their passion for each other.The plot in HER CARDBOARD LOVER switches the gender here, it is Norma Shearer in the Cary Grant role out, this time, to ward off an exboyfriend George Sanders by means of hiring Robert Taylor to pose as her gigolo. The problem is, Shearer is much too old to be playing a role more suited to an actress in her midtolate twenties; Sanders is about as involved as a piece of furniture for the most  any man who would be in love with his fianc\u00e9e, on seeing a strange man come out of her bathroom as happens here, would knock the lights out of him and cause a huge scene. Not here. And Robert Taylor plays his part as if he were trying to channel Cary Grant half the time, not in speech inflections but in overall essence.But the worst part of it is Shearer herself. For an actress used to parts which gave her a sense of intellectual sexiness and dramatic presence, playing Consuelo Craydon seems to put her into throes of complete overacting, overemoting, and overgesturing which, while still a part of her style of acting and more appropriate ten years earlier, makes her look like an extremely mannered performer wrenching the joke out of a situation like water from a fairly dry sponge. It only fuels the fires that tell the theory which gives Irving Thalberg the maker of her career and chooser of most of her roles; why she passed on roles such as Charlotte Vale and Mrs. Miniver on megahits NOW VOYAGER and MRS. MINIVER is a mystery, but then again, most accounts also state that by this time she had just burnt out from acting, that she would had lost interest in the whole thing altogether and it is no secret that anyone who has experienced this sort of thing has essentially lost focus and cannot wait until retirement or the end of a contract is near to leave as soon as possible. Such could be the case here. She seems lost, she seems tired, she seems ill at ease, going through autopilot instead of living the part.

Gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she, otherwise a good actress, cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce. He is gentle, convincing and compelling in this role.The two meet on the beach through her daughter, Pip, and initially, Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid. All of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love.The chemistry between the two leads is not great, even though the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical. Two people meet, tragedy, bigger tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they get together. I wish there was more to it than that, but there it is in a nutshell.I wanted mindless entertainment, and I got it with this. In regard to the genre of romantic films, this one fails to be memorable. A Secret Affair with Janine Turner is far superior not a Steele book, as are some of Steeles earlier books turned into film.","label":0},{"index":10873,"txt":"This movie got off to an interesting start.

That is really sad when i cannot even tell what happened in the first 3 minutes.Anyway it stars a photographer with a big mustache who finds this girl after dumping his other girlfriend on the way to take pictures of something somewhere. so we get there but not before somebody steals their jeep to drive it 200 feet out of the way towards a town. suspicious? nah. so they decide to stay at this deserted village with one old lady. and then blah blah stuff happens and blah blah talking. The guy with the mustache goes out in the fog for some reason even though the old lady tells him not to. He gets lost and then finds his way back.Oh, i forgot to mention this is all after an incredibly pointless 20 minutes of them staying in the house of a guy who looks like that buggy eyed guy from casablanca.

The opening scene of this film has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the story. In it, a photojournalist with a big mustache cancels his vacation to get away from his girlfriend. He is assigned to photograph a mountain range. It is rumored to be haunted, but I could not tell whether he heard that from his boss or later in the film. On his way, he meets a beautiful writer Patty Shepard and convinces her to join him on his working trip. Throughout the film, there is this terrible music score, mostly consisting of noisy singing that makes you want to scream SHUT UP ALREADY!!! What really will gall a person is that the film always seems like it is about to become good, though it never does. There is beautiful mountain scenery and some genuinely creepy atmosphere. The inn and the silent, abandoned old buildings scattered on the mountain are rather ominous. The foggy nights look real, not like someone put an artificial fog machine on the set. And the idea, while not original, had potential. But it never does improve, at least not enough to be worthwhile. Heres how it goes, more or less. They stop at this inn run by a weird innkeeper you expect him to be named Igor with a hearing problem. There is a scene where the writer thinks a peeping tom is in her window, but the scene is so dark, I had no idea what was going on. Whether this was poor lighting or a poor film transfer is unknown to me. In any event, we never find out know what happened. There is a scene where she wanders off during the night. Whether she is sleepwalking or mesmerized by the witches of the title is never explained. Another scene which is never explained is when their car is stolen, then found again, with nothing stolen. They wind up in this apparently abandoned mountain village whose sole inhabitant is this seemingly kindly old woman. There are other things, including a chained wild man in a cave who is never explained, an attempt to sacrifice the writer in some way will they kill her or brainwash her into joining them?, the witches themselves, a bunch of brunette women in white robes who do not show up until the last 15 minutes of the film and whose practices and beliefs are never explained.

He calls work and demands that he loses his vacation time and she says he will pay for this. What relevance this plays out to is anybodys guess at the films end, because the guy, a swarthy photographer, spies a beautiful Patty Shepard, queen of Spanish horror films it seems, taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture, ask her out to lunch, and then to his assignment to Witches Mountain  for reasons again we are never privy to. Before they go, Patty must stop by the house and loud, eerie chanting echoes in our heros ears. Again, this is never explained. The film goes on with these two stopping at an inn, going on to the mountain, and finally realizing why the mountain is called Witches Mountain. You know, there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a bad film. It has some atmosphere, some of the character actors are really quite goodespecially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman, the leads are at least adequate, and the climax  though it makes absolutely no sense at all  is wellchoreographedliterally with the witches in white brassieres and long black hair. It just does not make any sense though, and that is a huge detractor to me. I could watch the film another ten times and still not know more now than I did after the first viewing.

The second is that the very beginning is not explained very well and I am still not sure what was going on there. The third problem is that I did not understand the ending, but apparently some people do. Of course there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things, and the male lead is very 70s.

Also saying that the current available print is dark, dreary, scratchy, abysmally edited, painfully dubbed, seemingly censored and in almost unwatchable shape is also correct. This film is in dire need of a good remastering from the full, uncut, original negative and seeing how it is reasonably atmospheric and won the director an award at the Catalonia Film Festival, it might actually be worth the trouble. Then again, maybe not... It is just impossible to tell in its current condition what kind of movie it actually is. It starts fairly interesting, if you can discount the completely senseless precredits opening sequence, which involves a deranged catkilling, snakeloving little girl named Gerda. The girls mom, Carla M\u00f3nica Randall, who should have laid off the eyeliner a little bit, splashes some gasoline around in the garage and torches the brat. Seemingly about as crazy as young Gerda, she goes to visit her estranged photographer ex? boyfriend Mario JohnCihangir Caffari. He is on vacation from work, but so desperate to get away from Carla that he begs his employers to set him up on an assignment... any assignment. She scowls You will be sorry! as he heads out the door. Well, Mario is assigned to photograph Witches Mountain somewhere in the Pyrenees, I believe. Before he gets to his destination, he gets sight of a hottie on the beach named Delia Patty Shepard and snaps a few pictures of her taking off her bikini top. Only slightly peeved, she claims to be a single writer, the two flirt and then decide it would be a swell idea if they went on the trip up the mountain together. When they stop by her place so she can pack her bags, Mario suddenly hears loud, sinister music. Delia claims he is just hearing things.So the two begin their trip up the mountain, taking a stop at a local inn to spend the night. There they encounter a weird, partiallydeaf, crazyeyed innkeeper Victor Israel and Delia claims someone was spying on here through her window. The next day, under some trance, she wanders off up the mountain and is eventually located by Mario, who hops out of his jeep and runs after her. While he is finding out what is up, someone steals their wheels and they are forced to walk a piece, eventually finding the jeep undamaged at the foot of a small, ancient, seeming abandoned village... almost like someone was trying to intentionally lure them there. Well as we will see, that is exactly what has happened. In the village they encounter a friendly old woman named Zanta Ana Farra who claims she is the only person still living there and lets them stay in her home. Mario takes some pictures of the abandoned city and when he develops them they are eerily full of people. Slightly creeped out, he and Delia begin to leave and get stuck in treacherous fog and have to pull over and camp out for the night. The rest of the movie has to do with voodoo dolls, black cats transforming into sexy women, Satanic rituals performed by ladies in their bras and a deadly fall off a cliff. And yeah, coincidentally Carla the estranged wife turns out to be one of the witches, too. It all takes place in semidarkness and to be quite honest, I did not know what the hell was going on most of the time. The inconclusive open ending is just an additional slap in the face to anyone having to suffer through the rest of this senseless mess.Honestly, there are just a few things that stand out to me as being really good. The first is actress Shepard, who has that great Barbara Steele kind of dark, mysterious beauty. There is also an excellent music score credited to Fernando Garcia Morcillo and chanting songs, which aided immensely in making this film as atmospheric as it is.

Unfortunately for Frankie, she makes the mistake of taking Skellen on her little embassy raid, and he plans to thwart their plan from inside with a little welltimed outside help from his SAS comrades.The film is inspired  quite obviously  by the awesome SAS assault on the Iranian Embassy in 1981. Someone who saw that event on the news apparently thought it would be good to devise a film along similar lines. Unfortunately, the film is rather banal, with too much stupid dialogue and a heck of a lot of embarrassingly bad scenes the archbishops debate which descends into a riot, anyone? Frankies idea to bring about peace by instigating a nuclear blast is ridiculous anyway, so she becomes a laughable figure just when the audience is on the verge of viewing her as an interesting villain.

The story comes through as a failed attempt to glorify the SAS commandos. Ideas like when a commando shouts \u0084heads down all good guys do it and all bad guys do not so that they can blast away ad lib with a good conscience, that the main character does not get mown down by the gas masked commandos although he wears the same clothes and carries a weapon from their arsenal just seem to be unlikely and make it hard to take the movie seriously.

Overall, I think Who dares wins could have been an interesting 45 minutes episode of The Professionals but the story does not carry a feature film.

This incarnation of Gary Cooper does not seem exactly like the Cooper of just a few years later he talks faster in this early film, among other things.However, unlike the average Bmovie of the era, there are at least a few interesting elements that make the film unique if not good. If you ever want to see the woman that was married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita stars as the female love interest and this is a very, very odd casting choice, as she has a heavy accent she was French and was not even close to being movie star pretty. Incidentally, she was also married to director Michael Curtiz. But for me, the most memorable and weird aspect of the film is the seemingly gay subplotsort of like a BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN from the 1930s and we thought this was a NEW idea. Gary Coopers character was raised by two men who hate women and do everything they can through much of the film to keep Cooper clear of females. This misogyny alone does not necessarily mean much, but there are so many clues throughout the film that indicate the makers of the film really were trying to portray them as a gay couple. In particular, towards the end, when one of them is killed, the other is shot by an arrow and holds off dying long enough to crawl over to the body of his fallen friend and then fallswith his arms cradled around him! This was pretty edgy stuff for the time and I think this makes this dull film really fascinating today! As far as Cooper and the plot go, the film is a bit of a disappointment and very skipable.

Again, unfortunately, I can see why this film was released, and why people are renting true life sex scenes and full frontal equally, both male and female nudity.

I got to admit being a guy I had heard there was nudity in this film so I thought to myself well even if its horrible at least there is nudity yea I know, I am a jerk. Well thanks to the uber crappy camerawork you never really get to see anything, and the things you do see, TRUST ME  YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE. This film made me want to vomit on numerous levels.The dialogue made me want to vomit, the camerawork made me want to vomit, but mostly the idea that this film was praised by some legit critics, well now that more than anything makes me want to vomit.","label":0},{"index":10897,"txt":"It is like hard to like describe just how like exciting it is like to make a relationship like drama like with all the like pornographic scenes thrown like in for like good measure like, and to stir up like contro like versy and make us more like money and like stuff.

But before I like begin like breaking new U.S.20somethingairhead records with the my likes, let me like just briefly list like the high like lights of this visual like feast 1. Chris doing the deed with his genitals. And not just that the way the camera guided so elegantly by Ellen and Patrick rewards the viewer with a fullscreen shot of Chriss fat whitetrash stomach after he finishes the unCatholic deed  that was truly thrilling. I can in all honesty say that I have never seen such grace. Chris, you should do more such scenes in your next movies, because that is exactly what we needed as a continuation of what that brilliant, brilliant man, Lars von Trier and his Idiots 95, started. A quick w and then a hairy, fat, white belly what more can any moviegoer ask for?! Needless to say, I can sit all day and watch Chris ejaculate in spite of the fact that I am straight... Such poetry in motion. Such elegance, such style. No less than total, divine inspiration went into filming that sequence  plus a solid amount of Zen philosophy. Even Barbra Streisand could not get any more spiritual than this.2. Ellens hairy, thick arms. The wobblycamera closeups, so skillfully photographed by our two directors of photography I cannot emphasize this enough, Ellen and Patrick, often caused confusion regarding the proper identification of the sex in question. There were several scenes when we would see a part of a body a leg, arm or foot, yet it was often a guessing game does that bodypart belong to a man or a woman? Naturally, Chris and his fellow artists, Ellen, Patrick and whatsername, cast themselves on purpose, because their bodies were ideal for creating this genderbased confusion. It was at times hard to guess whether one is seeing a female or male leg. Patrick is so very thin and effeminate in his movements, so hairless and pristine, whereas Ellen and the other girl are so very butch, what with their thick legs and arms. Brilliant. 3. Brilliant  especially the way that neatly ties in with the theme of role reversal between the sexes so utterly original and mindblowing. Ellen behaves like a man, wants sex all the time, while her ex Patrick wants to talk  like a girl. Spiffing.4. Ellens search for a Leftist mate. He must love The Simpsons, which is quite Leftist. I am glad that the makers of this movie decided to break the long tradition of offering us intelligent Leftists. Ellen is such a refreshing  and realistic  change. The number of likes that she and her liberal friends manage to utter in less than 80 minutes is truly phenomenal 3,849, to be exact. They have managed to realistically transfer their reallife ineptness onto the big screen with a minimum of effort, and I applaud them for that.5. The closeups of toes. Plenty of stuff here for footfetishists, which I think is a very liberal, highly commendable way of reaching out to sexual minorities. After all, shoe and foot fetishists are offered so little in modern cinema, so it is nice to see that someone out there CARES.KOTM, or rather, KLOTLMAS, offers more than meets the eye. It is not just a modest little film about shallow people engaging in hollow relationships while indulging in meaningless conversations. No, it is much more than that. It is about the light that guides all silly creatures; the guiding light that dominates the futile lives of various pseudoartistic wannabes who just dropped out of film school, and plan to assault our senses with dimwitted drivel that will hopefully play well at pretentious festivals like Sundance and Cannes, enabling them to gain the necessary exposure hence some real cash for a change, with which they will later hire the likes of Sean Penn and George Clooney in promoting the saving of this planet and the resolving of ALL political problems this world faces. What better way to do that than by making porn at the very start? If Chris and Ellen did the camera here, as is clearly stated in the endcredits, then who held the camera while the two of them were in front of it? They probably hired some passersby and shoved the camera into their hands...Go to httprateyourmusic.comFedor8, and check out my TV  Cinema 150 Worst Cases Of Nepotism list.","label":0},{"index":10898,"txt":"Not the best of the films to be watched nowadays.

Using the scope format for the last time in his career, Metzgers exploration of la dolce vita is rich in visual excess note the emphasis on reflective surfaces, for example, though the films sexual candor seems alarmingly coy by modern standards.

Many of the ways in which it has been made to work for a hearing audience on the screen do not work. The fairly academic camera work keeps the signing obfuscated, and scenes that are in ASL are hard to follow as a result even for someone who is relatively fluent. The voice interpretation of Matlins dialogue, under the excuse that Hurts character likes the sound of his voice, turns her more and more into a weird distant object as the film goes on. Matlin does shine in the few scenes where her signing is not partially hidden from view. But nonetheless, most of the movie, when this is a love story, is only showed from a single point of view, that of the man. As Ebert said, If a story is about the battle of two people over the common ground on which they will communicate, it is not fair to make the whole movie on the terms of only one of them.The idea that an oralist teacher who uses methods that have been imposed in many deaf schools for decades would be presented as revolutionary is fairly insulting in itself. His character becomes weakened as a credible teacher as the movie goes on. Drawing comedy from a deaf accent is, quite honestly, rather low. And his attitude towards the male students of his class is pretty symptomatic of how he seems to act with women as an entitled man. A party scene involving a number of deaf people including a few academics meeting together leaves him seemingly isolated, in a way that is fairly inconsistent with his credentials I have seen interpreters spontaneously switch to asl between each other even when they were not aware of a deaf person being in the area, and yet somehow he feels like a fish out of the water in an environment his education should have made him perfectly used to. As a lover, he seems like a typical dogged nice guy, including his tendency to act possessively afterwards. And yet the movie is, indeed, only really seen through him, as everything his lover says is filtered through his voice. The scenes involving the other deaf kids are, in general, wallbangers. The broken symbolism fails, the dance scene, the pool scene, even the initial sleep scene which is supposed to carry some of it  all these scenes that try to hint at the isolation of the deaf main character are broken metaphors, at best many hearing people I know do dance on the bass beats that deaf people feel instead of squirming like copulating chihuahuas, and going to take an evening dive for a hearing person is rarely an excuse to make a deep statement on the isolation of deafness no, seriously, when I go swim, I go swim...It also fails at carrying the end of the play, instead making it a story of a deaf woman who submits to a strong man. Even though the original play ended with a more equal ground, where both have to accept each other as they are, and where he has to finally recognize her real voice is the movement of her hands, not the vibrations in her throat.And for all the breakthrough that it may have seemed to be, Marlee Matlin remains Hollywoods token deaf woman to this day.","label":0},{"index":10906,"txt":"When I rented this movie, I had very low expectations......but when I saw it, I realized that the movie was less a lot less than what I expected.

Turning firsttime writer and director for this arty, obtuse drama, he works his script and characters out through the same methodical process, slowing the pacing down to a crawl ostensibly so we can catch every nuance and inflection. This approach might be fascinating if there were threedimensional characters to care about, but photogenic Morse and Mortensen are not really convincing as siblings. Worse, we expect more from prominentlybilled veterans Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who hardly get a chance to come through with anything interesting.

Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product, ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty, but ending up being, for the most part, glorified pro wrestling matches, and moralistic, almost as if Hallmark cards had developed a line of Hells Angels greetings, and make me long for the days of Deliverance, which is a fine movie. Viggo Mortensens acting is much, much more believable here than that ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg, and that is about it.

And Sean Penn serves it up for us with a cherry on top. Hey, A lot of people use Penn as a political whipping boy, but I do not rate movies or actordirectors based on politics or personality. That is what right wing commentators like excretable faux movie reviewer Debbie Schlussel does. While acknowledging he is one of our best actors and a good director, I think this picture was a simplistic piece of aimless dreck that he has atoned for since. Okay, you have the gist of this there is this good cop, a small town trooper, Joe, played against type by David Morse, who in the opening scene chases some guy on a country farm road in big sixties cars. The bad guy stops, gets out, shoots at him so Joe has to blast him dead. There was no explanation what drove this man to do such a desperate violent thing and the dead mans parents do some redneck freak out at the police station while Joe feels real sad and guilty that he had to kill someone. So we know that Joe, the farmer forced off his land into a cop job, is a good basic sort of guy. Then his brother Frank shows up, he is a sadistic, amoral bully, fresh out of the Army and Nam where the war got his blood lust up. Some people here and in other reviews called him just an irresponsible hell raising younger brother and Sean was trying to make some point about what our John Wayne tough guy culture and war does to otherwise good people but what I saw was an amoral, sadistic bully who enjoys hurting and ripping people off. Then there is mom and dad, Marsha Mason and Charles Bronson, who do the requisite turn as old fashioned country couple, then die off; she by illness and he by shotgun suicide, to advance the story for us. Both times Frank the bad guy is away being a miserable SOB. But good Joe brings him back to Podunksville from jail so Frank can straighten his life out by welding bridges and living with his utterly stupid screaming trashy pregnant wife. But Joe has a nice wife, played by Italian actress Valeria Golina, who is Mexican and Sean uses this as an exercise in some affirmative action embellishment of goody Joe and his real soulfulness underneath his uniform and crew cut. For me, that was an utterly pointless affirmative action subplot that Sean uses to burnish his tough guy creds by sucking up to Mexicans because Mexicans are so tough and cool.But Frank is bad and we get the requisite events like stealing friends car, robbing gas station by beating the clerk over the head then torching the car and all those cool things that hell raisers do. Then there are the mandatory 8mm film childhood flashbacks of young Joey dutifully moving the lawn and cowboy dressed Franky jumping on his back and wrestling him and yadda yadda so we all know what deep bond there is between the two of them.So the film meanders around with a lot of small town schlock to warm the heart of any red stater. Accompanying the film was a great soundtrack of good sixties songs like Jefferson Airplane and Janis Joplin which were totally inappropriate, except for the 60s era effect, to win the hearts of old hippies. The worst offense is that, since the movie was inspired by a Springsteen song, The Highway Patrolman, that song was not included. So Joes brain dead wife goes into labor and Joe runs off to the bar to get loaded and spout some populists drunken victims spiel about how tough things are while good Joey comes to drag him back to his wife. The bartender is good Ole Ceasar, played by Dennis Hopper. So Viggo  Frank whigs out for no particular reason and beats his pal Ceasar to death after good Joe the Cop leaves.So Joe has chase his bad brother down and I was so hoping that he would do the right thing and blow that menace to society away. Instead we get a scene where his brother stops ahead of him in some old 50s junker on some lonely road at night, and little Franky in his cowboy suit and cap guns gets out of the car to face good Joe, the kid from the 8mm flashback home movie sequence. Oy, such dreck! Then to top off this drecky sap fest, there is some Zen crap about the Indian runner, who is a messenger, becomes the message, ala Marshall MacLuhen?

It is a first and last attempt by writerdirector Soo Lyu. Rub and Tug 2002 is one of the unfortunate byproducts of Canadas program to promote homegrown filmmaking. While the program encourages worthwhile efforts like New Waterford Girl it opens the door for untalented novices like Lyu who did not have to aggressively pitch this project but was greenlighted without an adequate examination of her script or her credentials. You do not mind the low budget because the shabby production design, bad lighting, poor audio, and dreary docustyle shot selection is consistent with the subject matter; the workers in Canadian massage parlors. But the dialogue and the plotting does not give the actors anything to work with, the editor much to assemble, or a viewer any mental challenge other than suspension of disbelief. When your story is this simplistic the last thing you need is a muddled storytelling technique; even though nothing happens, the movie is hard to follow and pointofview impossible to pin down.

Has there ever been a more off, outofplace shot in any movie ever made?I consider it a miracle that I was eventually able to bypass this turd, and agree that Kubricks 2001 is a truly important film, given the immense bad will generated by both this stupid, stupid movie, and the cult of fawning but inarticulate Kubrick fanboys, who could not describe an idea at work in it with every film resource in the Library of Congress in front of them. Toss in the grotesque overacting of Jack Nicholson, the introduction of dumb oneliners at tense moments, and the Razzie nominated performance of Shelly Duvall and you have a very crappy movie.","label":0},{"index":10921,"txt":"If my memory is correct, when this movie was released it came across as something of a comedy  a funny look at the adult entertainment industry. If that is what it is supposed to be, it does not really work. It just is not that funny. Setting that rather significant since this is called a comedy! failure aside, since I have no personal knowledge of the subject matter, I will avoid comment about the authenticity of the story  which deals with the goings on behind the scenes in a Toronto massage parlour, except to say that  if this is true  the life is pretty dull. For over an hour, this movie really does not give us much of anything except some background knowledge of the main characters. Conrad is the newly hired manager of the massage parlour whose basic job apparently is to make sure the girls are not giving full service  a euphemism for actual sex. As for the girls themselves, Bettys goal is to buy a parlour of her own so that she can run her own business, Cindy is an illegal immigrant to Canada working to support her family back home and Leah is  well, Leah is a somewhat strange, undefined character with a nipple fetish  true  who seems to be in the business because  well, because she is in it! I have no idea what her character was about. Those three may well fairly reasonable composite characters who accurately represent the motivations of the women who get involved in this business.The movie meanders about and does not offer much until the twist reveals Conrad to be the bad guy. We should have gotten to that point sooner. The only thing truly interesting here was that part of the story  Conrads secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girls. That plan for revenge was pretty good, and you are grateful when it comes out because basically up to that point you are wondering why you wasted your time with this. Had the story been more focused on the revenge, this might have actually been a fairly funny movie.The performances from the 4 leads were all OK, although I did not think anyone came across as outstanding. All four characters were a bit shallow. Cindy was a sympathetic character, and so was Conrad for a while, although he turns out to be the bad guy of the movie. Given the subject matter, there is surprisingly little nudity and what there is is restricted to one scene. In fact, there even a certain air of innocence around a lot of this. As for the overall quality of the movie, it is a lowbudget effort, which shows, although you expect a certain griminess, I suppose, of a movie set in the context of a body rub parlour, so that is forgivable. It certainly says something, though, that this was released 8 years ago now and is still the only credit on writerdirector Soo Lyus resume and  given the normal lack of depth in the Canadian film industry  that it was not even deemed worthy of being nominated for any Genie Awards  the Canadian version of the Oscars. 410  and I am being a bit generous with that.","label":0},{"index":10922,"txt":"This apology for a movie is about absolutely nothing!

Someone said it could have been set in Oklahoma, and that just about sums it up for me. This looked like a romantic view of northern England made for the US market. Probably many Americans  and many southern English people  do not realize that Sheffield is a big city of around half a million inhabitants, with a sophisticated urban culture. In Among Giants it was depicted as some dreary deadend semirural small town, where everyone in Sheffield seemed to drink in the same oldfashioned pub, and where the peoples idea of a party was linedancing in some villagehall lookalike. This was a small closeknit community, not a metropolitan city.The workingclass Sheffield men were totally unlike their reallife counterparts, who are generally taciturn and communicate with each other in grunts and brief dry remarks. They do not chatter, and they certainly do not sing in choirs.Even the rural settings, supposedly in the Peak District, looked alien to me. I recognized a few places where I used to go hiking, but some of the aerial shots of pylons stretching out over a bleak landscape reminded me more of Wales. Indeed, in the credits at the end I spotted a reference to Gwynedd, Wales. The Peak District is, in the summer, crawling with walkers and tourists in cars. It is situated between two big cities. It is not some kind of wilderness.As for the notion that a young woman could fall in love with, and lust after, Pete Postlethwaite, that was ludicrous, and could only have been a male dream. Her reasons for becoming his lover were never made apparent. None of the men was shown as having a partner or families; they existed in a vacuum.Anyone wanting to see a film about unemployed Sheffielders would have been led astray. This Sheffield existed only in the minds of its middleclass writers and filmmakers.It was a gigantic fake!","label":0},{"index":10924,"txt":"Americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial, we tend to lose interest really fast.I found out an exciting fact from this film someone has to paint high tension utility poles and do it on a schedule!

I will not complain about the abysmal dialogue, as this is Star Wars... the original three films had style, cult feeling and cracking stories, and the strange dialogue added charm.

This is a travesty.First things first. The story. Anakins evolution? There is none. Apart from a little makeup around the eyes, and a little yelling, there is none. He becomes young, stupid, cocky Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader in a single blow. The only thing consistent about Darth Vader in the original series was his intelligence, how good he was at almost everything he did, planning, fighting, you name it. The only consistent thing about Anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity. He even loses his body because of a bout of stupid cockiness.What part of the Emperor Palpatine telling him legends of the Sith does not point to the Emperor being a Sith? Unacceptable!The fight scenes used too many digital doubles. Everyones flying all over the place like teddy bears in a makebelieve doll house. Count Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, ObiWan, almost every fighter had a rubbery digital double jumping around.In one specific fight scene, ObiWan and Anakin in the climactic battle, they both actually stop in the middle of parries and ripostes, to twirl their sabers a few times while inches apart. I realize the fights are choreographed, but that just got me shaking my head in disbelief and disgust.The writing was awful. All the dialogue was of tremendously low quality. The good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did the best they could with their lines, but that just was not enough. I cannot say enough bad things about this film. Too much special effects, plot holes bigger than the centre of the universe, and absolutely no insights into any of the characters. This is the biggest mistake of this film nothing new is offered. We know the rough picture of everything, all Lucas did was colour it in.We knew Anakin lost his limbs. We knew Luke and Leia are brother and sister, we knew Luke is Anakins son, we knew ObiWan and Yoda go to exile, we knew everything. Nothing new is offered in this film. If that is all the fans wanted, then that is fine, Lucas could not have gone wrong.But when Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader, and he asks after Padme, and hears she is dead, he reaches out his arms awkwardly and screams Nooooooooooooooooooooo. That scene screamed Bmovie all the way, and I was half expecting Darth Vader to go DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER at any time. That is what this is.

But you have to say, wow, those CGI environments are really impressive at times. Bu the lightsabre fights? They are all a blurry mess. I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed. This will make a ton of money, but thank god it is over, this onceworshipped franchise has been beaten down enough. I saw the 1201 show, and after it, I heard a group of very small kids say, wow that was awesome! But everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing I fell asleep in the middle.

I did not go when it first came out because, well, frankly, I was afraid. Afraid of how bad it might be, or how disappointing. While not as bad as Menace, and better than Clones, it was not particularly memorable, or satisfying.I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. From the opening crawl to the final credits it was a movie experience I will never forget. A timeless story of the bored farmboy who just knows he was meant for more, saving the princess and the Galaxy from the evil menace while being mentored by the wise wizard, the rogue pirate and the various comic reliefall in a spaceopera setting.And that is not to chastise Lucas for using an old formula. It is an old formula precisely because it works. And to his credit, he gave it new twists that made it very special.Then came Empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale. Darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time. The great villain, Vader was Lukes father. Wow, no one saw that coming. Of course, I am convinced neither did Lucas till it showed up in the screenplay. Go back and watch Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, particularly in light of the first three episodes, see if it really meshes.Which brings me to the problem I have. Revenge is an entertaining movietremendous effects, plenty of action, some good fighting scenes. But a movie still lives or dies on its plotthe story it is telling. Oh, certainly, really good acting can save a weak plot, but a weak plot coupled with bad actingthat is a burden no director can overcome, certainly not one as bad as I am forced to realize George Lucas is The man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actorsLiam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson.SPOILERS AHEAD The plot. Oh my. Understand, he is already handicapped by what is happened in the first two films so it is an incredible burden. One too much for him to overcome.First we have the sheer absurdities of the background. We have Anakin being found as a child on Tatooine, the product of a virginal, miracle birththe chosen one. Well, this detail never gets remotely explained. Indeed, the closest explanation is Yodas observation that maybe they were wrong. Oh, well, okay then. Our mistake.Now, this same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence that is. And he will come back to Tatooine and never know he was from there? Wow! How about that. Testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there, eh George? Anyway, we have this bratty kid, moody, petulant, whining young adult, who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in Cinematic historythe great tragedy of Darth Vadorthe good guy who falls from grace, only to finally achieve redemption in the end.How, pray tell, does this happen? Why, he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth. Now, sure, he lives in a starspanning civilization that treats gravity like we treat gasoline, but does it occur to the dark one to be to maybe check with a physician cause maybe, just maybe, this futuristic society might can do something about this problem? Why, no, the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they have been chasing for two films tells him that he is got the secret to immortality.Well, of course he does.Sheesh.How can Lucas expect us to watch such foolishness and be moved by it? How can anyone expect us to care? Hell, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place. I wanted Kenobi to kill him not because he was evil, but because he was pathetically stupid.Oh, by the way, Amidala finally dies. In childbirth. Why? Well, they do not know. The doctor, who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced, offers only the conclusion of she is lost the will to live. Well, oh, okay, of course she has. Maybe it finally dawned on her what a dweeb she was sleeping with.But here we are. We have Kenobi present for all this. He knows of the birth of Luke and Leia. Knows who their father is and knows what happens to them. Knows, also, the role of both R2 and C3PO. And yet, in several years, as Luke approaches manhood and shows up with 3PO and R2 curiously, 3POs mind is wiped, but not R2swhy???? stating I think these droids belong to you, Kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he believed to be the chosen one and apprentice to the Emperor himself, and who just happened to be built on this very planet, says strange, I do not recall owning any droids.Oh good grief.Lucas simply made this up as he went along. Once he introduced VAder as Lukes father, sadly, the story began spinning out of control because HE Did not KNOW WHAT THE STORY WAS. The plot of Episodes 13 is simply incomprehensible. Nothing Palpatine did made any rational sense at all. And none of this ties into the story he originally told in Star Wars.It is an afterthought, and it looks it.I cannot give this movie a high rating. It reminds me of Triple X.

Many reviewers out there are not old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. The enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed master director put this multilayered supernatural story on the screen. Salems Lot had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a TV miniseries, directed by Tobe Hooper he of Texas Chainsaw Massacre fame and was badly handled, turning the major villain of the book into a Chiller Theatre vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise. Fans hoped that a director of Kubricks stature would succeed where Hooper had failed. It did not happen.Sure, this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments, it is all downhill. Jack Nicholson cannot be anything but Jack Nicholson. He is always crazy and did not bring anything to his role here. I do not care that many reviewers here think he is all that in this clinker, the Heres Johnny! bit notwithstanding...he is just awful in this movie. So is everyone else, for that matter. Scatman Crothers character, Dick Halloran, was essential to the plot of the book, yet Kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest shock sequences ever put on film. I remember the audience in the theater I saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick, those that stayed that is...many left. Kings books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters, and often metaphysically.

A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them.

Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy JanMichael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twentyfive years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer dog at his side, is walking around killing the cattle and any people he runs into with an unusual item. You know those glowing plastic sticks stores sell for trickortreaters at Halloween, the kind that you shake to make them glow? Schiavelli uses what looks like one of those glow sticks to burn incisions in people. It is the secondworst effect in the movie. Every time Schiavelli is on screen with the glow stick, the scenes atmosphere suddenly turns dark, like the filmmakers thought the glow stick needed that enhancement. It ends up making the movie look even cheaper than it is.And what does all this lead up to? It is hard to tell when the final, confusing scene arrives. See, Burr and his team of scientists try to explain the satellite images that Shepherd found as some kind of calling card, but none of it makes sense. Why do Shepherd and Vincent age and Schiavelli does not? Schiavelli explains why he is killing cattle and people and why he wants Shepherd dead, but even that does not make much sense when you really think about it. I mean, why does not he kill JanMichael Vincent? After all, he had twentyfive years to do it. And the aliens will not need him if Shepherd is dead anyhow, so why try to kill her? Speaking of the aliens, it is never clear what they really wanted out of Shepherd and Vincent. What is their goal? Why do they wait so long to intervene? How could they be so sure Shepherd would come back? Not that the answer to any of these and other questions would have made The Return any more pleasant. You would still have bad lines, really bad acting, particularly by Shepherd, cheesy effects, and poor direction. Luckily, the stars escaped from this movie. Cybill Shepherd soon went on to star in Moonlighting with Bruce Willis. JanMichael Vincent went on to be featured in dozens of Bmovies, often in overthetop parts. Raymond Burr made a pile of Perry Mason television movies right up until his death. Vincent Schiavelli went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of films. Martin Landau, who played a kooky law enforcement officer, quickly made the terrific Alone in the Dark and the awful The Being before rolling into the films he has been famous for recently. You can bet none of these stars ever want their careers to return to The Return.

There is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the slugs into aggressive, meateating monsters  albeit monsters that move slowly and can be squished under your boot. Health Inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy. The climax is a laugh riot  unintentional at that  which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid actors and screenwriter the scenario of destroying the slugs is.STORY  No new ground charted here. Simon seems to play the gore elements tongueincheek but the dialogue is straight. Had Simon worked with a clever script  one with plenty of oneliners and eccentric characters, this could have been a cult film.VIOLENCE  You will not be letdown here. We get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine Italian restaurant. The blood and guts, that many horror film watchers enjoy, is in full swing here. You also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug smashing scenes.ACTING  Wow! Michael Garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this filmmaking endeavor is.

No one will believe him at first, but they will. Oh yes, they will.OK, killer slugs are right above psychotic sloths and right below Johnathon Winters as Morks baby in the creepiness factor.

You see, these poor slugs have been mutated through the pollution of evil humans and do not mean to do anything malicious, they are just slugs slugs with sharp teeth who eat flesh and excrete poison, but slugs none the less. The real bad guys are the humans, who either actively try to destroy our beloved slugs, or overreact when they encounter them.For example, take the scene where the guy puts on the glove full of slugs. They were just hanging out in a comfortable work glove when out of nowhere this giant hand came at them, and they reacted instinctively, defending themselves and biting the guy. Now, instead of seeking medical attention for his slug bite, this guy runs around his greenhouse screaming like an idiot, spills some highly volatile chemicals, starts a fire, knocks a bookcase over on himself, and cuts off his own hand then the fire and volatile chemicals mix and his house explodes. How can you blame that on the slugs?This movie paints a portrait of humans that is less than favorable. The characters in this movie include the dumb sheriff who hates everybody, the drunk hick who is mean to his dog, and the lumpy sidekick whose wife is at least fortyfive years older than him. There is also a set of drunken teensthat get attacked while copulating, and we have to see the skinny longhaired freaks genitals. Meanwhile, there is a guy who looks like a demonic Leslie Neilson who yells You do not have the authority to declare happy birthday! for some reason. Finally, this parade of loathsomeness is rounded out by the guy from the MST3K classic Pod People whose face explodes after eating a sluglaces salad another easily avoided fate blamed on the helpful, harmless slugs.Humans are portrayed as greedy, stupid, racist, alcoholic, and, in one pointless scene, as wouldbe rapists.

It sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980, I remember. Then the movie came out, and the Kubrick cultists have been bickering with the King cultists ever since.The King cultists say Stanley Kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it. The Kubrick cultists do not give a damn about Kings story. They talk about Steadicams, tracking shots, camera angles.This is a film, they insist It should be considered on its own. As it happens, both camps are correct. Unfortunately.If one views it purely as an adaptation of Kings novel, The Shining is indeed a failure, a wasted opportunity, a series of botched narrative gambits. I used to blame that on Kubricks screenwriter. The writer Diane Johnson author of Le Marriage, LAffaire, Le Divorce, etc. has a reputation as an novelist of social manners. Maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics. But the little bluecollar town of Sidewinder, Colorado does not exist on any map in her Francophile universe. Kubrick the Anglophile probably found her congenial, however. He, of course, is the real auteur. And considered on its own merits, his screenplay for The Shining  with its mishmash of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism, and implied reincarnation  just does not stand up to logical analysis.I am willing to consider Kubricks Shining on its own terms. I am even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horrorgenre movie. But it does not succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation, alienation, and madness either. Parsed either way, the film pretty much falls apart.Are the horrors of the Overlook Hotel real? Or do they exist only in the mind  first as prescient nightmares suffered by little Danny Torrance, then as the hallucinations of his father? One notes how whenever Jack Torrance is seen talking to a ghost he is in fact looking into a mirror. One notes how the hotels frozen topiaryhedge maze appears to symbolize Jacks stunted, convoluted psyche. Very deep stuff.But if indeed the Overlooks ghosts are purely manifestations of Jack Torrances growing insanity, then who exactly lets the trapped Jack out of the hotel kitchens deadbolted walk in closet, so that he can go on his climactic axwielding rampage?And can ANYONE explain, with a straight face, that blackandwhite photograph helpfully labelled 1921 of Nicholson as a tuxedoed partygoer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotelballroom wall during the films closing seconds? Are we to seriously conclude that Jack Torrances Bad Craziness stems from a some sort of past life experience? And if you swallow that, since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas their past selves?Maybe Kubrick did not care about his storyline. Maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror. Whatever the case, the film tries to hedge its narrative bets  to have it both ways, rational and supernatural. As a result, the story is a mess. This movie has not improved with age, and it certainly does not improve with repeated viewings.I do not deny that a few moments of fear, claustrophobia, and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long, long film. But those gushing Elevators o Blood, seen repeatedly in little Dannys visions, are absurd and laughable. And Jack Torrances infamous tag lines Wendy, I am home! and Heeeeeeres JOHNNY! merely puncture the movies dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy. I know I sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief Whew! Glad we do not have to take this stuff seriously! Finally, Kubrick is completely at sea  or else utterly cynical  during those scenes in which Wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son. A foyer full of mummified guests, all sitting there dead in their party hats? Yikes, now I really am afraid.Given Jack Nicholsons brilliance over the years, one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeballrolling, eyebrowwiggling, scenerychomping performance that the director wanted. The performance of Shelley Duvall, as a sort of female version of Don Knotts in The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, is best passed over in silence.This movie simply does not succeed  not as an adaptation, not on its own terms.

The timing of the oneliners is off, but they are the best thing going for the movie. The five women who play the wives do not add up to one whole actress between them. The plot is very weak. Even the premise is pretty weak; there are a few jokes about having multiple wives, but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie. Most of the movie could play the same way even if Rodneys character had only one wife, so the premise seems more like an old mans fantasy than a key part of the comedy. Another old mans fantasy we are supposed to accept that Rodneys character is an athletic skier.Jerry Stiller seems to be phoning in his role just to do a buddy a favor, and the rest of the name actors must simply be desperate for work.The odd nods to political correctness later in the movie do not really do anything for the movie.

As a parent, or even as a 10yearold, you have seen it all before, and done better before. Think 101 Dalmatians Meets Home Alone and you get the general idea.

Apparently, this is one of the better of his 180 films \u0096 it is hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there.The unfathomable plot deals with Francos usual themes of sex, violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of SM for good measure, and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious.I may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy Euro Horror again \u0096 life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this.","label":0},{"index":10977,"txt":"I know that in this episode there is other stuff apart from what I am going to discuss, and in fact I think it has some virtues; for example, the fact, after we had been given a very negative opinion of Jin from seeing Suns flashbacks in House of the Rising Sun, we get to see Jins side of things and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life.But there is an element in this story that made me so deeply uncomfortable that it greatly dampened my enjoyment of the whole episode. Before now, in the scene where Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, it had been hinted that Suns father was someone who was getting rich through shady, illegal methods. I thought maybe he was a mob boss, even; mobs operate in Korea, just like in almost every other country in the world, so it was a reasonable possibility. However, in this episode we learn that Suns father is in fact the boss or a top executive of a Korean automotive company, and that what Jin had been doing was physically attacking a government official who was actually going to be murdered on his behalf.I may be especially touchy about this because I happen to work in the automotive industry, but I would say it is SPECTACULARLY offensive and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing goes on in Korea; that huge, serious companies like Hyundai or Kia which must be the model for this fictitious car company, as they are the only ones that actually exist in reality operate with these mafialike methods, instead of like any normal automotive company of the West. it is just unbelievable to me that the writers would have the gall to write something like that into the story, and that there has not been an uproar in Korea over it.

The film is neither interesting, like some of Fulcis more tame Giallos, or gory like the majority of his cult classics; thus leaving it lacking in both major areas, and ultimately ensuring that the film is not very good. The film works from a plot that has been used many times previously, but still it is an idea that always has the chance of springing an interesting story just because it focuses on the theme of the afterlife, which is the ultimate unknown. This film focuses on Giorgio Mainardi; a man that is not exactly well liked and after he dies of an apparent stomach hemorrhage, there are not many people that are sad to see him go. This means that his ghost is trapped somewhere between life and the afterlife, and so he decides to try and get to the bottom of his death, and his only ally in this endeavour is his daughter.The video that I saw this film on is proudly proclaimed that the film is in the style of HP Lovecraft, and that is one of the most blatant attempts to sell a film I have ever seen. There is nothing even slightly reminiscent of the great horror writer in this tale, and the reason for that tagline would appear to be because of title similarity to the Stuart GordonLovecraft film, From Beyond  which is a lot better. The film does benefit from a distinctly Italian style, and the score is rather good. Unfortunately, however, Fulci has seen fit to positively roast every scene in it  and so the theme quickly becomes annoying. The plot plays out in a really boring way, and most of the scenes simply involve the ghost desperately trying to find things out, or the daughter placing her suspicions over her family members. This movie was made for Italian TV, and so it is not surprising that it is all rather tame. There is a little bit of gore and a nightmare sequence with zombies; but this is not the Fulci we all know and love. Overall, this film is extremely mediocre and not a good representation of Fulcis talents. Not worth bothering with, unless you are a Fulci completist.","label":0},{"index":10981,"txt":"Seeing a photo of a man being attacked by zombies gave me hope that Lucio Zombi Fulci might be up to his old tricks. Unfortunately, other than the close ups of a rotting corpse, there is little to recommend in this story of the murder of a wealthy man and his daughters quest to figure out who killed him. None of the characters are appealing and by the time you find out how they did it that twist, at least, was cool, you stop caring. The only good thing I can say is that it made more sense than Nightmare Concert!","label":0},{"index":10982,"txt":"This is definitely not one of Lucio Fulcis better flicks by any stretch of the imagination. The plot is pretty bad, a millionaire is murdered and his spirt calls upon his daughter to find out who did it. But the biggest problem i have with this besides knowing who killed him within 10 minutes of watching the movie was wondering why anyone should even care? The father comes off as being a really big jerk to everyone he came across including the daughter who he asks to help him which made it quite hard for anyone to care who killed him. But no one really watches a Fulci flick for a good storyline, to do so would be like watching a porn for incredible script writing and acting. Typically his movies try to compensate for this by adding excessive scenes of gore but even that is lacking in this movie. If you are looking for a good Fulci flick, check out The Beyond.","label":0},{"index":10983,"txt":"He really lost the plot with this one!

His estranged daughter arrives, and he manages to contact her through her dreams I think, and he wants her to find out who killed him before his body entirely decomposes in its grave.There is not too much mystery about who did it, or even how; most viewers will have figured that out long before it is revealed. I am not sure the way he was killed would really have worked.Anyway, the horror elements get in through a gory autopsy, the recurring dream of the man killing the boy, a nightmare in which a plate of eggs turn into eyes which are then cut, and several shots of the decomposing man both in nightmares and actually in his grave.I was a little surprised to see a dedication in the end by Fulci to Clive Barker!

I have got to admit that I saw the American cut version, which runs at about 76 minutes; but unless it was just the logic that was cut, I am sure the longer European version is just as boring. The plot has something to do with a woman marauding around; practicing SM and talking rubbish, and it is all really boring. There is no gore and the sex is dull, and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film; I had difficulty making it all the way to the end. I have to say that the locations look good and Franco has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere; but the positive elements end there. Jess Franco is definitely a talented director that has made some classic trash films  but this looks like it was one he made for the money, and overall I recommend skipping it and seeing some of the directors more interesting works.","label":0},{"index":10988,"txt":"I watched 34 of this movie and wondered why it got such horrible reviews here.

A sociopathic genetic material donor fixates on the recipients and, in typical stalker form, intrudes into their lives.As I said, most of the movie was fairly good.. we see Conan grow more and more obsessed in raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother. Of course things do not work out for him the way he planned. Not a bad plot line.But, the last 15 minutes were just horrible.

Sylvan Simon Production MGM This mediocre B mystery was one of only five films released in 1942 with Simon as director. Surely he could have fit another Red Skelton film or two on his schedule! Anyway, Grand Central Murder is a shameless ripoff of the Thin Man films minus the wit, charm, and chemistry of the leads. We are treated to a paper thin plot that can barely support its 73 minutes, bad acting and weary gags.Van Heflin and Virginia Grey play Nick and Nora Charer, Rocky and Butch Custer. He is a PI and she is his wife and sleuthing partner. They engage in humorous banter with each other. See? It is completely different already. Heflins the only one here who hints at bigger and better things, although he is real close to being a jerk in this. Virginia Grey was in Another Thin Man, but again, let me stress, THIS FILM IS NOTHING LIKE THAT ONE, no sir. And just in case we start to think that this film is absolutely nothing like another film say, THE THIN MAN we actually like, Sam Levene pops up as the lead detective who is kind of dim and has to have Van Heflin subtly direct him toward all the important leads. Hmmm.Quickly, the murder is that of bitchy schemer Mida King, who likes to trade up on rich men until she finds an even richer one. She is played by Patricia Dane, who is like a C version of Hedy Lamarr, until she opens her mouth and turns into an F. There is a whole array of wacky suspects, all with their own motivation for wanting Mida dead. There is the society type, the tough talking dames, the thug, the exlover, and a shady theater impresario Tom Conway, here saddled with the unlikely character name of Frankie Ciro. Roman Bohnen plays a nervous, jittery type, something I believe he may have done before. Millard Mitchell plays an idiot cop who, in a running gag that will not quit, cannot stop thinking about the piece of ass he is got waiting for him once this case gets wrapped up that is right, Millard Mitchell, swordsman. Finally, in a completely ground breaking method of storytelling, something we have never seen before, all the suspects are gathered up in one place where they tell their stories as flashbacks to the detective, as Rocky takes mental notes, until eventually the guilty person is compelled to dramatically blurt out a confession.On top of the actual picture being a dud, I naively thought going in that there might be a couple of location shots of the actual 1942era Grand Central, but alas, no. There is merely one very brief shot at the beginning. Thanks for nothing, Grand Central Murder.
