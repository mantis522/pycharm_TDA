And you are either in it or out of it. Is it that there is no press at all to report everyday incidents. Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and Page 3 is just a supplement; perhaps an entertainer for checking out who is who and what is what. Do not mix the two.

I find it strange that so many actors conversant with the English language have such a hard time doing so convincingly in front of the camera. I am sure many readers know what I am talking about  all those token English phrases thrown into a movie, in Hindi and in regional cinema for cool points.

While Black was weak to an extreme, Page 3 delivers a gripping story with some strong acting  good direction. The songs were almost incidental  blended in almost seamlessly with the film. There certainly were not any women getting sprayed with water for no apparent reason from mysterious water sources while gyrating wildly on the streets at night.I was pleasantly surprised with the bold and unabashed approach used by the director. There was no glossing over of anything and almost every scene was completely believable.I would recommend this films for Hindispeaking people with at least a slight understanding of Mumbai life. The former because the English subtitling was below par and contained many errors which, at times, completely reversed the meaning of the actual statement. The latter because you will definitely appreciate the accuracy of the depiction once you have lived it yourself.I would definitely rank this as a work worthy of international recognition. The scenes with the gossiping drivers was a nice touch and it served simultaneously as a source of genuine humour as well as another perspective on the whole mishmash. The movie does fall short in a few places though, where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things which detract from the overall direction of the film.I also thought that a couple of the sadder scenes were not done very well. It was a touch amusing to watch, rather than arouse any feelings of sadness  the whole scene tended to come across as a bit foolish.

He looks ... less like the burn victim he is supposed to be, and more like he has a skin disorder. Changing the leads makeup like that so far into a series is about on the same level as changing the lead actor. But wait! They have done that, and done that. So I guess it does not matter. But it mattered to me. Freddy is no longer SCARY. He is just ... another lowrent monster like the Leprechaun. It is more...a dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises; riddled with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty oneliners and clever repartee sadly, it fell short on both accounts.

After the endearing, wideeyed innocence of A New Hope and the thrilling sophistication of The Empire Strikes Back, I remember awaiting Return of the Jedi with almost aching anticipation.

He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he does not have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact  your honor, I call Jarjar Binks but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first.From the initial raising of the gate at Jabbas lair, this film was nothing more than a twoplushour commercial for as many licensable, profitmaking action figures as Lucas could cram into it  the piglike guards, the hokey fleshpigtailed flunky, that vile muppetpet of Jabbas, the new and recycled cabaret figures, the monsters, etc., etc., ad vomitum. Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks. Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens.

The blatant, exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating.Lucas did not even bother to come up with a new plot  he just exhumed the Death Star from A New Hope and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. What an appalling slap in the face to his fans. I cannot shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans I have got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking, putrid garbage that I could dream up, and they will flock to the theaters to scarf it up. Plus, all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped, cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in, and I get a cut from every single one.

When Maggie realises what Freddy is up to her  some kids decide they have to kill Freddy once  for all...Directed by Rachel Talalay this was made with the intention of being the final A Nightmare on Elm Street film which by this time had reached five, of course as any horror film fan knows if there is still money to be made from a franchise or a character then there is no way in hell Freddys Dead The Final Nightmare was going to be the last one which, of course, it was not. The A Nightmare on Elm Street series has been a franchise of diminishing returns as the films dropped in quality as the series progressed until we got here  Freddys Dead The Final Nightmare which for my money is probably the worst out of the lot of them. The film moves at a reasonable pace  it is rarely boring but it is so silly, childish  feels like some sort of liveaction cartoon with some awful setpiece horror scenes that seem a million miles from Wes Cravens suspenseful  effective early 80s original. The sequence where stoner Spencer is trapped inside a video game being played by Freddy is terrible on it is own but then we are treated to shots of his body back in reality bouncing around the house from wall to wall  floor to ceiling which is quite the most ridiculous thing I have seen in a while, or maybe the early scenes when the John Doe kid falls from a plane down to the ground just like the Coyote cartoon character in the Road Runner cartoons or the absurd sight of Freddy threatening the deaf Carlos with pins that he intends to drop to the floor to make a loud noise or when he eventually kills him by scraping his knives across a blackboard. You cannot take this seriously  I was just sitting there not quite believing what I was seeing. When they do finally try to kill Freddy the hero is given a secret powerful special weapon, yeah that is right a pair of cardboard 3D glasses! The characters are poor, the dialogue is poor  the plot is confusing, it does not really stick to the Elm Street continuity  overall the film is a bit of a mess, the best thing I can say about it is that it has quite a bit of unintentional humour  you can certainly laugh at it.The film has major tonal problems as it tries to be dark, scary  sinister yet it is so silly  simply looks ridiculous at times that any attempt at being serious falls completely flat. There is not much gore in this one, there is some cut off fingers, some stabbings, someone falls on a bed of nails  that is about it. The body count is extremely low here with only three deaths. The final twenty or so minutes of Freddys Dead The Final Nightmare was in fact shot in 3D although the version I saw presented this part as normal so I cannot comment on how well this does or does not work but you can definitely see shots which are meant to be seen in 3D which take advantage of the process. The special effects vary, some are quite good actually while others are terrible  Freddys burnt makeup this time looks quite poor.This apparently had a budget of about 5,000,000 it had an opening weekend boxoffice take of 12,000,000  the film has a few nice visual touches  gags which makes the thing feel even more cartoony than it already is. The acting is really poor from the main leads although there are a few odd cameos including Tom Arnold  Roseanne, Johnny Depp  rocker Alice Cooper.Freddys Dead The Final Nightmare is probably the worst of the entire series  apart from some unintentional laugh value there is not much here to recommend or enjoy.

However, just two years on and I find I cannot remember enough about them in order to do it \u0096 I guess they could not have made much of an impression. From what I do recall, some of the sequels \u0096 Dream Warriors in particular \u0096 were not as bad as is often made out, though even the original was no classic. Generally, the predictability of the premise if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams does not lend itself to narrative tension. But while I cannot recall much of the first five films, I do know they never plumbed the depths of Freddys Dead.An indication of how sick of Freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the characters demise. The fact that the movies conclusion is not even hidden, but in fact the entire purpose for the films being goes to illustrate how vacant, soulless and cynical this venture was.Taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain, Robert Englunds innowayscary interpretation booms with laughter. I always thought Freddys mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. It is like Englunds crying out we know this is garbage \u0096 but you are paying to see it, so who is the one laughing? And I am sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight. Was Freddys appearance in the films always so rudimentary? All he gets to do here is a few haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr \u0096 har \u0096 har \u0096 hars and that is it. If this was the only Elm St. film you would ever seen you would not get to know the character at all. Even as the character predeath in a flashback Englund plays him as a boohiss pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic ie. overstated, misplaced and not at all funny irony.Acting is almost universally poor. Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, keeps his dignity. And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. The script, too, is absolutely lousy, almost wholly without merit. Carlos Ricky Dean Logan opens a road map, upon which the Noel Cowardlike Freddy has wittily written you are fked. When prompted for the map, Carlos responds well the map says we are fked. Who wrote the screenplay, Oscar Wilde?Or how about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy, his hearing enhanced to painful levels? So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin \u0096 a potentially fatal sound, given that all sounds are magnified. Oddly, the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. Nice hearing from you, Carlos, quips Freddy, hoping some better lines will come along. It is also worth noting that dream sleep does not occur instaneously, so being knocked unconscious would not allow instant access into Freddys world. Though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3D finale plot logic is not that high on the list of requirements.The teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious, dislikeable group in the whole series. Tracy Lezlie Deane is the only one who gets to greet Freddy with shut the fk up, man and a kick in the scallops. And was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddys Dead. No laughs.

Anyone who has not seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point. The first, and potentially the biggest, wasted opportunity, was the plot with Freddys longlost child. Now, the extreme mental illness that Freddy appears to suffer and I might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people, leave alone to this extent is HEREDITARY, so why not a mysterytype slasher in which Lisa Zanes character dreams of Freddy murdering the teens, only we later discover it is actually her doing all the killing? Sound like a good plot idea to you? Obviously it was above the heads of Talalay and De Luca.Then there is the trip to Springfield, where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out, and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis. Funnily enough, said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner, although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much. We are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond ones comprehension and control. The essential problem with this plot element, however, is that the town is abandoned too quickly, and with no real answers. This collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say... one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the Springfield fair looks like a horror show.Of course, horror films are never noted for their character development, unless they are the kind of horror films John Carpenter used to direct, but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die? At least Wes Craven took the time to set up his characters in the original, and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in. That, in a nutshell, is probably the biggest problem with Freddys Dead it just does not try at all, leave alone hard enough.On a related note, I feel kind of sorry for Robert Englund, now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the Freddy character. He has played far better characters in far better productions the sciencefiction miniseries V, for example, and to be forever remembered as the man who played Freddy is selling him rather short. It seems he will never break the mold of horror films now. As for the rest of the cast, well, I think their performances here speak for themselves. They deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than Bgrade horror props. Even Yaphet Kotto does not escape this one unscathed, as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of Bfilms.All in all, Freddys Dead gets a 1 out of me. I would vote lower, but the IMDb does not allow for that. FD is really a testament to how a writers inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film, but an entire franchise.","label":0},{"index":4027,"txt":"Freddys Dead The Final Nightmare, the sixth installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series and once again another bad sequel. I think this is tied up with the last sequel of the Dream Child. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street series box DVD set for my birthday, so I got to see all the sequels. May I say that I am just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels, at least the past two, it just seems like Freddy lost his edge. It is almost like the writers were trying to give Freddy a soul and they are just destroying it instead of reinventing the story. This was a sequel that was not needed, sorry to Robert Englund, but this was very much below what Freddy Krueger represents.Freddy is back, but he is got something we do not know about, a daughter. Maggie, she is not aware that he is her father, but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help. She has to do her best to resist his powers, but it is hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father. Ironic, is not it? But Freddy is not giving up without manipulating her into his ways.Freddys Dead The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3D, radical, huh? Note the sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels, it is tied up with the fifth sequel of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, I would rather watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street to be honest. This just had bad acting, stupid editing, and just over all a bad idea for a story. I did not like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who Freddy Krueger really is, the death master of nightmares, not Father Knows Best.210","label":0},{"index":4028,"txt":"George Brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress.

Gus Van Sant directed and adapted Tom Robbins book, but his satire has no primary target and just skitters all over the map, like Sissy maybe that was his goal, but it is not involving for an audience. Notorious boxoffice flop was not so much panned as it was ignored, and one can see why it is a series of sketches in search of a plot, and the performances, directorial touches and cinematography are all variable.

The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues does not include an eighth of the content in the book, and it seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie, I think that better actors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters. The only actors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins descriptions in the book were Julians friends, in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie.

How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it under GAY PRIDE  WOMEN  LESBIANS. That is the Library of Congress subject heading. Now anyone over 12 who reads the book will know it has NOTHING TO DO with real lesbians, any more than STAR WARS is about real space travel. The book was obviously  and I do mean OBVIOUSLY written by a heterosexual male who loves the IDEA of lesbians in the nude, all the timebut has never really met one.Still, someone in Hollywood said, uh oh, better give this to a Gay director or Gay People will make trouble. So they handed it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against the man, but  however Gay he may really be  he has not a clue as to how to make a funny film. Gus Van Sant took a straight mans playful fantasy of guiltfree girlgirl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull, literalminded Lesbian Power Recruiting Poster. It is like turning an Oscar Wilde comedy into an Arthur Miller tragedy. Not pretty.The main clue that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting. His clout allowed him to hire the very best. His ignorance of the novels real subtext a straight mans fantasy, not a gay pride recruiting postercaused him to make choices that were not only bad, but bizarre.Let us meet the cast of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES.PAT MORITA as THE CHINK Okay, there are few namerecognition Asian actors. And Pat Morita, in HAPPY DAYS, was fairly funny. But casting him as THE CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that the Chink is a very funny man. Gus did not tell him. Pat also does not seem to know that the Chink is . . . well, SEXY!!! In the book he is not wise old Mr. Miyagi. He is more like Hugh Hefner! He is a randy old goat and he knows A LOT about pleasing the nubile and responsive Sissy AND Bonanza Jellybean. You see, in the book, they are not REALLY lesbians. Do you get that this is a straight mans fantasy yet? JOHN HURT as THE COUNTESS. Okay, he is a gay friendly man. But he is a SERIOUS, SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR!!!! You need someone who is fun, and camp, for this role. For John Hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the Countess is tragic and sad. I kept expecting Paul Scofield to wander in all dressed up as Thomas More, and sadly shake his head. Now, Richard, you know you have lost your soul entirely. For shame, my former student! And yes, John Hurt was funny and pretty gay as Caligula. But that was BLACK humor, not playful and breezy humor like the book.RAIN PHOENIX as Bonanza Jellybean. No talent, no training, no problem. Except that in the book Bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, mostly heterosexual, and loving. In the movie she is sullen, passive, expressionless, and dull. As for her taste for women, Robbins in the book puts it like this. God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Uh, Gus? Did you read this book? UMA THURMAN as Sissy Hankshaw. This is a tough role. In the book Sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine. Still, a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye, or a sway in her walk, to imply some sort of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures. Uma does not pull it off, probably because Gus never told her Sissy is supposed to ENJOY being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs.

The fighting scenes with the natives are about as good as you would remember in those old black and white Tarzan movies, you know where you see a spear fly through the air and camera cuts to a dead native lying motionless on the floor with it sticking from his thigh. Is that instantaneous death? There are also several quite unnecessary scenes which have nothing to do with the plot, like the little girl being rescued while collecting flowers. The really badly animated clay toys are too painful to watch. If you do see this movie the crabs which inch forward at about 5kph are the highlight. Somehow one manages to creep up on David Mccullum and give him a nip.

Which is why I decided I would do something I had never done before. Review the same movie again. Do not get me wrong, I still do not like the movie, I still think it is dreck, and I still think the zombies do not look all that zombieish. The story in the movie is still in my opinion, weak and rather lame. The story is about a guy named Rick, who works as a scientist that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells, in animals and his brother Germaine, the two are not exactly on the best of terms my my, an original plot point and argue a lot. One day Germaine is shot in a driveby shooting, and Rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to resuscitate Germainewhereas most people would have called 911, but whatever, naturally the serum fails and Germaine dies if that did not happen there would have been no movie, after the police and the coroner until the end of time I will still think that maybe the paramedics should have shown up leave the scene shows the coroner van which I still believe was just someones van with a coroner decal thrown on the side, and Germaine returning to life to attack and kill the paramedics. I would talk more about the plot, but I feel that if I reveal more about the story you would not want to watch it and we would not want that now would we?, but suffice to say that the story in my opinion at least meanders and is rather slow moving pun not intended. As I have previously said in my review the zombies do not look all that much like zombies, I still think they look like they have been in a bar fight. That is not to say that they should all be decaying and whatnot, but still there should at least be bite marks on the victims. Also I still do not like the fact that the directors continually switch up the pace at which the zombies move. They could not really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombies run or shamble as most zombie movies do, do not get me wrong, I am all for running zombies but make up your minds people. In one scene the zombie runs toward the living, and in the other he just shambles to them. And sometimes they just do not seem believable yes I know their fictitious creatures but still, I am of course referring to the zombie that runs his hand on the wall as though he were walking through a dark living room, and I still do not like the zombie who is lying on the ground, gets shot, then jerks like he was just shot. The sound in the movie also bothered me, mainly the music, which while it may have just been my copy of the film seemed pretty much nonexistent. Music in a movie is important folks. Especially when the sound editing does sound like the director just took a friends camcorder and shot a little zombie flick. The acting is still atrocious in my opinion and is on par with the American actors from the Japanese zombie movie Junk. The movie is still bad, almost House of the Dead bad, it is better, no doubt about that, but then again that is not saying much. It is not the worst movie out there, and it is better than a lot of direct to video movies that are out there but at the end of the day was not good. I also think the movie moves really really slow, despite the fact that it is only an hour and twenty or so minutes and yes, I still do not like the opening song. This is the type of movie I think is wellsuited to be premiered on the SciFi network. Which is why I am obligated to give this debacle of a film a one out of ten. But think of it this way, at least it is not a negative one.","label":0},{"index":4071,"txt":"I happened to spot this flick on the shelf under new releases and found the idea of a hiphop zombie flick far too interesting to pass up. That is how it was billed on the box, anyhow, and I thought to myself, What a great idea! Plus there is a Welcome to Oakland sign on the cover, too. How could I resist? Unfortunately, the hiphop part only lasted for as long as the opening theme. Neither hiphop music nor hiphop culture had much of a role in the movie. Having lived in Oakland myself, I know that there are many aspiring hiphop artists there, so the low budget of this flick was no excuse not to have a fitting soundtrack. Any number of struggling artists would have jumped on the opportunity to contribute to this flick. Why the Quiroz Brothers did not take advantage of this is beyond me.Once the film got rolling, it was a completely typical zombie movie with a cast that just so happened to be completely black and Latino. You might think that this would put an unusual slant on the movie... but it did not. Somehow, the Quiroz Brothers vision of urban culture boils down to driveby shootings and dropping an Fbomb in every line in the movie. The rapidfire use of the word fuck is probably this movies most distinguishing characteristics; there were single lines that contained the word three or four times, and no line did not contain it at least once. I am not at all squeamish about swearing in a movie, but the feeling here was that it was the result of a lack of ideas on the part of the writers also the Quiroz Brothers, and the script was generally very poor.The film was generally a disappointment. It would have been interesting to see a genuinely urban culture zombie flick, but Hood of the Living Dead does not deliver on that count. The characters in the movie could just as easily have been white or eskimo or anything else. There was no distinct flavor to the movie. It is just another runofthemill low budget flick with bad acting, lousy writing, amateurish direction, bland cinematography, a cheap soundtrack, and nothing at all to recommend it.","label":0},{"index":4072,"txt":"...you know the rest.

Well, if the director envisioned his audience cringing and wincing at every sentence uttered by Ricky or alternately bursting into uncontrollable laughter at moments when most directors would want a more somber reaction from their viewers, then yes; Ricky did an outstanding job.I am an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and I had to do a play where I had to cry and it is not easy to be emotional in a scene so I give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off.Wow.

I shall now turn over the movie bashing to my associate, Mr. Bangla. Howdy!

Whether you want help articulating your disgust or ammunition for a stirring repartee, if I say anything good it will only disappoint youso let me assure you, there is little chance of such disappointment. The other negative comments here at IMDb have already enumerated the particular failings of the movie e.g. the acting, the soundtrack, the directing, the dialogue, the editing, etc., however all of these faults can readily be forgiven, in and of themselves. Few people will rent a movie titled Hood of the Living Dead if they require these elements to be topnotch. The ultimate failure of Hood, however, is its failure to deliver on the abundant promise of its name. Hood of the Living Dead practically leaps off the shelf at the video store with its implications of corny oneliners and gruesomely creative kills. Here was a chance to mix the cheesy gore of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto, to have gangstathug zombies bombin on the innocent living while rockin dorags, to have undead pimps drivin over alltoomortal police in their trickedout rides. The mixture of the two genres could have been hilarious. Instead, the movie is more like watching middle school kids timidly deliver the lines to a play they are performing, but do not understand. To avoid a feeling of betrayal on the part of their videorental audience, I suggest that the Quiroz brothers rerelease the movie with the following new title Hood of the Living Dead A homemade horror video we shot on our camcorder with some friends over a weekend last summer because we were bored. Or perhaps they could release it as a documentary.

Drawn to her innocence and simplicity, Shahid agrees to the marriage barely moments after he is met her at her home in Madhupur, and the young lady in question Amrita Rao seems equally floored by her charming suitor. The marriage is fixed for six months later, and the couple find themselves in the first throes of young, budding love, their geographical distance notwithstanding. But Amrita, who is been raised by her uncle and her aunt after her parents death, is struck by a horrible calamity just hours before the marriage. And then, it is up to Shahid to play the honourable lover and to embrace her unconditionally.Much in the same vein as Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Hum Saath Saath Hain, Barjatyas new film Vivah too is on one level a family drama with an extremely idealistic premise. But sadly, the plot of this new film comes off looking way too outdated, even more farfetched than those regressive Ekta Kapoor soaps. And the problem is clear \u0096 you just cannot relate to such squeakyclean characters who do not have one bad bone in their bodies. There are many things that work in favour of and against Hindi films, and timing is one such important factor. Twentyfive years ago, perhaps the plot of Vivah may not have felt like such a stretch, but today it just seems like the product of a mind stuck in a time warp. Perhaps the films only saving grace is the fact that it oozes sincerity from start to finish, you can make out right away that the filmmakers intention is not to deceive. Judging both by Barjatyas previous films and by closely examining this new one you can safely declare that Barjatya believes in a perfect world, he believes in his goodasgold characters, he believes that large families can live together happily under the same roof without the slightest bumps.But alas, he is unable to translate his vision to the screen. It is difficult to overlook how onedimensional his protagonists are \u0096 Shahid and Amrita, both virtuous and virginal \u0096 I mean, think about it, the first time they hold hands is an hour and twenty minutes into the film. Barjatya may think he is returning to his Maine Pyar Kiya roots with Vivah, but truth is that the reason we embraced Salman and Bhagyashree in that film, or even Salman and Madhuri in Hum Aapke Hain Koun is because they had such fantastic chemistry. Because although they were created out of the same mould as Shahid and Amrita in Vivah, those pairs had mischief and masti. Shahid and Amrita are just insipid and boring.For a film that relies so heavily on music to narrate its story, the filmmaker chooses a string of 70sstyle tunes that only further slacken the films deadening pace. But if I had to choose just one reason to explain why Vivah does not work for me, it is because I am not sure I can relate to any of the characters who inhabit Barjatyas story. To some perhaps, Vivah will give hope, that a perfect world like this is actually out there somewhere. But I am a little cynical I guess. So, give me the coquettish Madhuri of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, give me the bratty Salman of Maine Pyar Kiya, I will even take that mischievous Karisma Kapoor of Hum Saath Saath Hain.

Even allowing for the culturally sanctioned inebriation, they have neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and undo what they have set in motion. After all, love is all that is important, is not it? To hell with everybody else. Whether or not things work out in the end is really not the point; in fact it is quite irrelevant.

This is not exactly my idea of a fun topic and the film footage closely resembled a collection of home movies. Considering I did not know any of these people, it was even less interesting.Because it was a rather dull slice of life style documentary, I wondered while watching what was the message they were trying to convey? Perhaps it was that values are not as conservative as you might thinkthis was an underlying message through many of the vignettes such as the Republicans whose son was a draft resister as well as the man and lady who thought sex outside of marriage was just fine. Or, perhaps the meaning was that there was a lot of bigotry underlying the nice home townas several ugly ideas such as blaming Jews for financial conspiracies, antiBlack bigotry and homophobia all were briefly explored.The small town of 1979 was explored in great depth and an idyllic sort of world was portrayed, but when the film makers returned six years later, the mood was depressed thanks to President Reagan. This seemed very disingenuous for several reasons. First, the 1979 portion was almost 90 of the film and the final 10 only consisted of a few interviews of people that blamed the president for just about everything but acne. What about the rest of the folks of this town? Did they all see Reagan as evil or that their lives had become more negative? With only a few updates, it seemed suspicious. Second, while it is true that the national debt doubled in the intervening years, so did the gross national product. And, while Malle shows 1979 as a very optimistic period, it was far from that, as the period from 19741980 featured many shortages gas, sugar, etc., strikes, high inflation and general malaise. While I am not a huge fan of Reagan because government growth did NOT slow during his administration, the country, in general, was far more optimistic than it had been in the Ford and Carter years. While many in the media demonized Reagan a popular sport in the 80s, the economy improved significantly and the documentary seems very onesided and agenda driven. Had the documentary given a more thorough coverage of 1985 and had not seemed too negative to be believed after all, everyone did not have their lives get worsethis defies common sense, then I might have thought otherwise.Overall, not the wonderful documentary some have proclaimed it to beranging from a dull film in 1979 to an extremely slanted look at 1985.By the way, is it just me, or does the film DROP DEAD GORGEOUS seem to have been inspired, at least in part, by this film?

The frustrating part is that it is 13 of a GREAT film. The first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl he is paid to protect. The trailers to this movie all mention that she is kidnapped. So, I am giving nothing away when I say that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess after she is kidnapped. Whatever the director was trying to accomplish, all he succeeds in doing is making the audience literally nauseous. Rapid, frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next halfhour as Creasy tracks down the perpetrators. These cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is to jolt you out of the story. I am sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story signified a change in Creasys character and signified that a different movie was to follow. Well, he was right. The movie that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap. The result of which is a depressing ending that ruins even the quality first forty minutes of the movie.","label":0},{"index":4085,"txt":"Do not get me wrong, I love action and revenge flicks, I have seen many of them since I was a kid, including Dolph Lundgrens latest The Mechanik which is quite good. And Tony Scott certainly know how to use a camera and even might be a genius shooting and editing films.But with Man on Fire and even more then with Domino, Scott shows that rather than using his filmmaking genius skills intelligently, he uses it puposelessly to show off and compensate a lack of substance that his material does not offer him. Man of Fire is close to 2 hours and half when it really should have been at least an hour less.The way Scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you the audience to sit through his film because his constant camera moves and flashes really are a torture for the eye and makes you wanna leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes into it.At times where the MPAA and studios have questionable attitudes regarding ratings, violence and making PG13 movies, I find also suspicious that a 70 million movie is made of a Bmovie script with a character who cuts fingers, puts a bomb in a mans ass and blows a guys hand with a shotgun, all this to avenge the death of a little girl who Is not even dead!

I am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh proof with most of their movies, but in this case there was WAY too much. It seems like the jumpcuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over Mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end. For a movie that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that it is story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development. That is another disappointing aspect of the movie. If I want to watch an over the top action flick I do not need any justification, but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of Denzel Washingtons character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances. The first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb archetypes and clich\u00e9s are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens. So the movie does not work either on the level of a believable dramathriller , nor as a pure action movie. Of course the movie is not as bad as some oft the totally messed up blockbusters of the last years, but I absolutely cannot understand why so many people claim this movie to be something fresh and so cool.

Jim Henson may have ended The Muppet Show when it was at its peak, but spin offs like this and Muppet Babies which apparently is based upon a very terrible sequence in this film are the absolute nadir of all things Muppet. I used to wonder why Muppets attracted such derision from such film reviewers as Mr. Cranky, so I am glad that The Muppets Take Manhattan henceforth TMTM set me straight on that one. Of course, many series have had a massive drop off in quality when the third episode came around Aliens, RoboCop, The Evil Dead, even Night Of The Living Dead. So while it is no surprise that TMTM is less than The Muppet Movie or The Great Muppet Caper, the surprise lies entirely in how much less than the awesome debut or its slightly lesser followup TMTM is. Not only is the music far less satisfying, the scenes that link it all together are utterly terrible.There are, of course, some redeeming and genuinely funny moments, but they are few and far between. The Swedish Chef is great in any scene he inhabits, so thank the spirit of small mercies that he appears in one sequence where his eccentricity is exploited to the fullest. The problem is that there are just no scenes that work. The story, such as it is, revolves around a Broadway musical Kermit is attempting to get produced. He goes through many trials and tribulations along the way, including the sneaking suspicion the viewer has that we have seen this all before. The biggest problem is that Kermit does not have a decent antagonist to work off this time. Charles Durning was cinematic gold as Doc Hopper, the proprietor of a fast food chain who wants to exploit Kermit for his business. Charles Grodin was dynamite as Nicky Holiday, a jewel thief the Muppets must fight in order to save Miss Piggy from a lifetime in prison. The saying is that a hero is only as good as his antagonist, and these two are at least half responsible for the greatness of the previous two films.Charles Grodin also highlights what is wrong with TMTM. Namely, the music sucks. The opening number of the Manhattan Melodies show that is at the centre of TMTM, to put it nicely, makes the drivel that now dominates the airwaves seem coordinated. I might just be letting my peculiar sensitivity to the sounds of words and phrases getting to me, but songs like The Rainbow Connection inspired tears of joy, not irritation. Grodins big solo during The Great Muppet Caper, while not having the same resonation, he lifts the tone of the film eight steps on his own. He is all class. And if there is one thing TMTM could use, it is rising eight steps in addition to attaining a semblance of class. TMTM also feels severely timecompressed, with the story leaping from scene to scene without any consideration for making sense or giving the story cohesion. Maddox himself pointed out that transition and cohesion make a film feel like a coherent whole rather than a mess of throwntogether pieces. See if you can find them in TMTM.While TMTM does have its guest stars, they are either poorly utilised Brooke Shields and John Landis, or totally out of their element Liza Minelli, Dabney Coleman. To call this a waste of time for puppeteer and actor alike is flattery. The absence of an end credits routine is especially sore here, after Animals go home postscript for The Muppet Movie in particular. Which highlights another problem. The characters are poorly written at best, with none of their individual quirks to be seen or heard. Animal shouts singular words at times, but they have nothing to do with the plot, or the conversation going on around him. Say what you will about set pieces designed to show off characters, but think of Animals moment after eating the instant growth pills, or his sowwy after the incident when he pulled the window down on top of his fellow Muppets. Now see if you can remember a single memorable moment with an individual Muppet other than Swedish Chefs hilarious misunderstanding of threedimensional film involving popcorn. Give up? Then you have proved my point.Given that Labyrinth, one of the Henson companys best and most timeless products outside of the Muppets, arrived some two years later, it makes TMTM all the more puzzling. Perhaps this misfire convinced Jim Henson to rethink his strategy regarding character development and usage. Or perhaps the misfire can be attributed to Frank Oz, who at the time had just finished working with George Lucas on what many would agree is the most childish episode in the original Star Wars saga. The writers were also involved with The Great Muppet Caper, so I will let them off the hook for this in spite of the fact that a script is one of the most essential pieces of a film. The production is also substantially improved here, with Muppets appearing capable of moving in ways that were previously beyond them. Had the story and script been better thoughtout, TMTM might have been at least comparable to The Great Muppet Caper. As it stands now, it is a great answer to the question of whether Muppets write under the influence, or excrete.For that reason, I gave The Muppets Take Manhattan a three out of ten. Two to denote its actual quality, and a bonus for the Swedish Chefs moments. Without him, this film would be unwatchable.","label":0},{"index":4090,"txt":"As a Turkish man now living in Sweden I must confess I often watch Scandinavian movies. Most if them I never understand.

I will say that there is a good idea for a movie here it made me think about how few films there are about the Irish Revolution but, as usual, Ford is determined to bury it under overacting and cheap sentiment. I suppose it is somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the lessthanseamless transition that was being made from the silents to the talkies  the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue. Of course, title cards would prevent Ford from restating every bit of emotion six times. What dialogue there is usually has a They are always after me Lucky Charms! quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an Irish accent. Of course, as bad as they are, the accents are helpful in reminding us we are in Ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some German expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over. It feels as if, with an eagle eye, you might see some villagers off to torch Dr. Frankenstein in the background.Techniques change. Tastes change.

Judging by the comment index i was not the first and i am not to be the last person in Western Europe to learn that this musician undoubtedly one of the best on our contemporary pop scene, even the Dutch agree on that tried to be an actor. Whether he should have made the attempt or not cannot be judged. In Intensive Care he is quite likable, but he seems to be uncomfortable with the flick in which he is participating. No one can blame him. It deserves its ranking in Verheyens Hall of Fame by all means  standards. The story of the Murderous Maniac Who is Supposed To Have Died In An Accident But Is Alive And Wrathful has been told dozens of times before, and even without original twists a director can deliver a more than mediocre story through innovative settings and cinematography. IC contents itself with a hospital wing and a couple of middle class houses. The pace is dull. The tension looses the last bit of its credibility to the musical score, for every appearance of the murderer is accompagnied by a tedious menacing melody, followed by orchestral outbursts during the murders, which or largely suggested and in any case as bloodless as a small budget can make them. The sex scene is gratuitous but not in the least appealing. The couple from Amsterdamned could have made it work, though. While dealing with the couple subject  the whole subplot between Wauters and the girl does not work. A more effective emotional connection could have been established on screen if they had just been fellow victimstobe, who loosen their nerves halfway through physical intercourse. I will not even grant the other cast members the dignity of a mentioning, for they should all have been chopped up into tiny greasy pieces. As a matter of fact, most of them do. The ones i recall where obvious for the genre  a pretty nurse and two cops. Hence, in a slasher, the cavalry only comes in time to need rescue itself. The anti hero has to take out the villain, mostly through clever thinking, for former red berets do not often get parts in these films; they might overcome the illusion of invincibility that surrounds the killer. Translated to the events, Wauters kills the doctor and saves the dame in distress. No people, i am not finished. This is not how the story goes. Wauters makes his heroic attempt but gets beaten up with a fury that comes close to A Clockwork Orange, so it is up to the girl to pick up the driller killer act and pierce through the doctors brains. Though this method ensures the killers death more than the usual rounds of 9mm bullets, the doctor survives in order to enable IC to reach the 80 min mark.I should have made my point by now. Intensive Care is a bad movie, which can only be enjoyed by Bad Taste lovers, who can verify Verheyens catchy statements and make some up for themselves and that way try to sit through it. For example, the unintended parody value of the doctors clown mask Halloween and the final confrontation in the park the chase at the end of Friday the 13th.However, let me conclude by giving an overview by a few measly elements which give IC a little credit. George Kennedy is not one of them. All he has to do is endure a horrible monologue by a fellow doctorFrench actor and look horrified when they let him go down in flames in order to tag his big name on a standin. He could have played his Naked Gun part again, to end up as beef, but with a longer screen time. The finale may be one of them. I had never seen a maniac being brought down by launching fireworks into his guts in order to crush him against a flexible fence.

The animation was the only okay in parts of the film except for the orks they looked awful and Aragorn and Sam face.I do not know way this film was released because there was not even a proper ending, but maybe it was good that the maker ran out of money because the film could not of got any better.

By any objective measure this was a disaster, but I found it easy to imagination how good a Lord of the Rings movie could be if someone was to make one sincerely  and with the money to employ the most talented artists and script writers. Unfortunately, thanks to Jackson, that will not be possible for a long time.Watching this movie left me with the impression that with any sort of budget at all, then this story simply could not be stuffed up. Fantasy just provides so many opportunities for making an interesting film. There were many moments in this film that were potentially more interesting than the way that Peter Jackson did it, although of course you always have to use your imagination due to the poor execution. The way they tried to show the wraith world from Frodos point of view for example. Or the way that Galadriel showed Sam what was happening back home for another.Another thing I really appreciated in this version  the silent moments. There were moments when dialog was spoken with no background music against a still backdrop. Compare that to the grandiose swooping camera of the Jackson films, and the intrusive score which seemed designed to stress how each and every scene was the most poignant and powerful scene we had ever watched. Jacksons films were full of their own importance, this was quieter and a lot more modest.Jackson and co hit this with more than US270 million dollars in production costs, at least 90 million dollars more for marketing, a massive tax break from the NZ government, and also gained massive savings from filming in NZ not the USA. However, despite the marketing claims, the intention to be faithful was never there. This is well documented. Philippa Boyens said as much in an interview, when she said they deliberately did not reread the books before writing the script. Jackson also stated that they originally intended to make a fantasy film along the lines of the lord of the rings, and that the one he really wanted to do was Return of the King, because it had a lot of battles but no character development.In contrast, this film tried to be more true. Of course a lot of things were wrong, the acting was awful and pretty much sunk everything, and the pace was too fast. Naturally they cut a lot, and adapted other scenes, and for this they deserve credit. While Jackson added a lot of action scenes that served no plot purpose, Bakshi cut book scenes which did nothing to advance the plot anyway. There is actually a curious similarity between the structure of the Jackson and Bakshi films near the beginning  in that they both deviate from the original books in the same way  although of course some of this could be coincidence.This was not a good film, but the potential was there. Bakshi said in an interview to the Onion AV club that only animation could do the lord of the rings justice. His version did not work, but he might have been right.","label":0},{"index":4114,"txt":"I might have given this movie a higher rating before Peter Jacksons trilogy came out, but seeing the two of them side by side there is simply no comparison. The pace of this movie is rushed, many important scenes from the book are left out, and there is little character development. The animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted over, which I found distracting. And the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks off in the middle of the story and was never finished. There are some good points the battle scenes are exciting to watch, and the dialogue follows the book pretty much to the letter. Watch this one if you are in a hurry and cannot spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy. But if you have not read the book you will probably be confused, because there is a lot missing from this version. 4 out of 10.","label":0},{"index":4115,"txt":"I have not seen this movie in a while, so I am afraid I cannot be very specific about details... It did have some interesting points. Ralph Bakshis attempt at an animated adaptation of J.R.R Tolkiens masterpiece was a very ambitious project, so ambitious in fact that it went bankrupt at some point during the production. Therefore, not only does it stop abruptly somewhere around the middle of the second book of the trilogy with sort of a shade of a hint of a sequel that was never made, the film itself seems less than finished. It seems that some characters were animated while others were filmed, but whether or not it is intentional is hard to say. The whole thing seems shabbily made and undone, especially the Orcs and the Nazgul. Another problem, of course, is the huge gaps in the plot. Bakshi was in a rush to finish this movie, and he somehow hoped to cram a book and a half in little more than two hours the new trilogy by Peter Jackson does it in about twice that time. Far too many important bits were left out and I do not refer only to Tom Bombadil, which, I think, was lovely in the book but would look silly in a movie. And of course, the ending, which is completely sudden and out of place. I am not even sure if Bakshi originally intended to end the film there, or if he even had any idea where he is going to end it.The characters... well, most of them were okay. The hobbits do not look so bad except for the gay Sam. Did you know that the producers of the new trilogy originally wanted to make Sam a woman so there would be a feminine lead character? If you are a Tolkien fanatic like me, watch this movie though I am not too sure about buying it. What special features does the DVD version have, anyway? But know in advance that you are not going to watch a real Lord Of The Rings Movie but not much more than a historical curiosity, which probably looks not much better than the 60s version would have had the Beatles carried on with their plan I actually think a psychedelic LOTR could have been quite cool. The idea was to cast George as Gandalf, Paul as Frodo, Ringo as Sam and John as Gollum.

Of course, I was seven at the time.Right before the Jackson movies came out, my wife and I rented this movie since she had never seen it and I was feeling nostalgic.Ralph Bakshi ran out of money about midway through the animation process for this movie, and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production. Since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping, the animation technique for people on a budget, this is saying something. Much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word. There are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen, with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them.Because of budget constraints, the movie  already a compression of The Fellowship of the Rings and part of The Two Towers  was pared down even more. What you get is sort of like a filmstrip version of the Cliff Notes of the books.Its not all bad, though, the animation brings a warmth to it, that I found lacking in the Jackson movies. Its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding.This movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came. Several years later, a halfhearted halfhour long TV special was aired, which was meant to wrap things up. All I will say about that is that it was a musical.","label":0},{"index":4117,"txt":"I saw this movie during a Tolkienthemed Interim class during my sophomore year of college. I was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy everyone else was laughing, but they were not within constant eyesight.Let us get it out of the way the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings films do owe something to the Bakshi film. In Jacksons version of The Fellowship of the Ring, for instance, the scene in which the Black Riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in Bakshis film, shot by shot. You could call this plagiarism or homage, depending on your agenda. I am sure the similarities do not stop there. I am not going to do any research to find out what they are, because that would imply I have some mote of respect for this film. I am sure others have outlined the similarities look around.This movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor, and many, many people died in the accident. I have decided to list what I can remember in a more or less chronological fashion If I have left out anything else that offended me it is because I am completely overwhelmed, confronted with a wealth of failure and, at high points, mediocrity.Due to heavy use of rotoscoping, Gandalf is no longer a gentle, wise wizard but a wildly flailing prophet of doom whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film.Saruman the White is sometimes referred to as Aruman during the film, without explanation. He wears purple and red for some mysterious reason.Sam is flat out hideous. The portrayal of his friendship with Frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying. Yes, hobbits are small like children, but they are NOT children.Merry and Pippin are never introducedthey simply appear during a scene change with a onesentence explanation. The film is filled with sloppy editing like this.Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry are singing merrily as they skip through along the road. One of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as large as he is from behind his backwhich was not visible beforeand begins strumming in typical fantasy bard fashion as they all break into lalalas. AWFUL.Aragorn, apparently, is a Native American dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic no pants, complete with huge, square pilgrim belt buckle. He is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movieoftentimes he gets one wobbly swing in before being knocked flat on his ass.The Black Riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil. They limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace. This is disturbing to be sure, but not frightening.The scene before the Black Riders attempt to cross the Ford of Bruinen in which they stare at Frodo, who is on the other side on horseback goes on forever, during which time the Riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and... do nothing else. The scene was probably intended to illustrate Frodos hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound. It turns out to be more plodding than anything else.Gimli the Dwarf is just as tall as Legolas the Elf. He is a DWARF. There is simply no excuse for that. He also looks like a bastardized David the Gnome. It is a crude but accurate description.Boromir appears to have pilfered Elmer Fudds golden Viking armor from that Bugs Bunny opera episode. He looks ridiculous.Despite the similarity to Tolkiens illustration, the Balrog is howl inducing and the leastthreatening villain in the entire film. It looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers, and it is barely taller than Gandalf. Purists may prefer this Balrog, but I will take Jacksons version any day.The battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing. Almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments. I am not asking for actionpacked scenes like those in Jacksons film, but they ARE supposed to be fighting.Treebeard makes a very short appearance, and I was sorry he bothered to show up at all. Watch the film, you will see what I mean.Alright, now for the GOOD parts of the film.Some of the voice acting is pretty good. It is not that Aragorn SOUNDS bad, he just looks kind of like the Jolly Green Giant.Galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal; like Tom Bombadil, she seems immune to the Rings powers of temptation, and her voice actress is not horrible either.Boromirs death is not as heart wrenching as in Jacksons portrayal of the same scene, but it is still appropriately dramatic and more true to his death in the book, though I do not believe Jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he did.As my professor pointed out between whispered threats, the orcs mainly at Helms Deep, if I am correct resemble the warravaged corpses of soldiers, a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what is being attempted.While this is not really a positive point about the film, Bakshi cannot be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie, or so I have been toldthe project was on a tight budget, and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higherups who I am sure had not read the books.Let me be clear I respect Bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude. I simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product. Overall, I cannot in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkiens classic trilogy even for laughs, unless you have already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters, places and events. I am sure somebody, somewhere, will pick a copy of this up in confusion; if you do, keep an open mind and glean what good you can from it.","label":0},{"index":4118,"txt":"Some people do not like the animation.

That means that there is a good chance that you will enjoy it more than I did. At any rate, you might find it useful to hear the film described from another point of view.Directed by William Cameron Menzies, who had as much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director, this is a film adaptation by H.G. Wells of his own novel by the same name. In my eyes, it helps demonstrate why a great novelist may not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriter.The film opens in 1940 in a Londonlike Everytown. War is brewing and the citizens of Everytown are worried that it might reach them. It does. And it turns into a decadeslong affair that basically destroys civilization. Wells and Menzies keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath. We see two pilots, one downed, coming to terms with the consequences of their fighting. We meet a postapocalyptic community ruled over by a wouldbe warlord. We meet a man from a burgeoning futuristic society. We see the way that technology is changing. And finally, we are taken to the full realization of that futuristic society circa 2036, where the leaders are debating the merits of sending man to the moon.That might all sound potentially very exciting, but it just does not work as a film. Structurally, the film is far too episodic, with little to dramatically tie it together. By the third segment, I completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters. I had barely been able to sort them out in the first couple segments. There is a constant parade of new faces. We do not get to learn anything about any of them.It does not help that the individual segments, with a couple exceptions, tend to be awkwardly directed and edited. They are also occasionally manipulativeit can almost begin to feel like a propaganda film. But maybe contradictorily, the segments are also a bit cold and dry emotionally.In fact, one overlong section is more like a music videoindustrial promotional video. If features shots of building the futuristic city, with lots of large machinery, lots of welding, and so on. At one point, a guy who looks like an astronaut waves at the camera through some kind of futuristic glass. The music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an overblown horror score. I cannot say that Things to Come consists of engaging material in terms of drama.But the common cry in support of Things to Come is that it is a film about ideas. That may be true, but there are a couple problems with it if looked at that way. One, it still does not make it work _as a film_, that is, as a visual and aural dramatic artwork, and two, there are far too many ideas presented here.The principle idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations. That is a fine thing to make a film about. It is also remarkably prescient of World War II, as the Things To Come was scripted and filmed in 1935 released in 1936. Wells has some interesting things to say about war, some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film. For example, the ending seems to suggest that another war is breaking out, or will at any moment. The overall message seems a trifle pessimistic. Wells seems to be showing that war is simply a part of human nature that cannot be excised, although it does not preclude progressin fact, maybe it fuels progress, at least indirectly.That would certainly be enough for one film. However, there are many more ideas here. The scene between the two pilots is one of the more poignant scenes of the film. It deals with a complex dilemma. One pilot has shot the other down, but is now coming to assist him. But the pilot who was shot down was carrying a poisonous gas that is now billowing across the field. They cannot both breathe the gas without harm. A girl comes along. They only have two functioning gasmasks between them. The pilot who was shot down offers his mask, as he says he is dying anyway. What to do? It is not that this scene itself could be stretched out to feature length, but the ideasthe bizarre complex of both helping and trying to hurt each other in the midst of a warare enough to build a film on.Another example. During the scenes featuring the wouldbe warlord, in the postapocalyptic environment, there is a nasty contagious disease called the wandering sickness going around. It turns victims into something like drunken zombies. The usual procedure is to shoot victims on site in an attempt to stave off the disease. This material is dealt with as if it were an afterthought. It is a great idea and deserved its own film.Similarly, Wells presents the future society as having controversial socialist ideas. That was enough for its own film, too. It is just impossible to effectively deal with so much stuff in 100 minutes, especially when it is supposed to be the crux of the film in lieu of dramatic attraction.Still, there are reasons to give Things to Come at least one viewing. If you are at all a scifi buff, this is a historically important film. Given Menzies background, the production and set designs are interesting, even if the cinematography seems extremely dated. It is also interesting to see how Wells was either prescient or retrospectively humorous in his predictions. I particularly enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon, which was strongly reminiscent of George M\u00e9li\u00e8s 1902 A Trip to the Moon aka Le Voyage dans la lune. Just do not expect too much from Things to Come.","label":0},{"index":4121,"txt":"Beyond a shadow of a doubt Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made, yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes and to be honest that is all you need to see combine to create something that is hilariously sidesplitting.The opening scene in space is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets, as washingup liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue. Before you have had time to work out whether it is you who is gone mad, the credits roll and the action struggles to life.And aside from the doubleheaded plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes, you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices AND the dubbed voices at the same time.

Fido is a film that is either an attempt to cash in on that, simply a manifestation of it, or both  and it falls squarely into the category of ironic zombies. The joke here is that we get to see the walking dead in the contrasting context of a broadly stereotyped, squeakyclean, alternatehistory we are in the wake of a great Zombie War, and the creatures are now being domesticated as slaves version of a 1950s suburb. It is a moderately funny concept on its own, and enough perhaps for a fiveminute comedy sketch, but it cannot hold up a featurefilm on its own. The joke that rotting corpses for servants are incongruous with this idealized version of a small town is repeated over and over again, and loses all effectiveness. The soundtrack relentlessly plays sunny tunes while zombies cannibalize bystanders. The word zombie is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiarly homey line for a cheap attempt at a laugh. The very broadness and artificiality of the representation of the nineteen fifties here cannot help but irritate me. It is so stylized, in it evidently Pleasantvilleinspired way, that it is more apparent in waving markers of its 1950sness around than actually bearing any resemblance to anything that might have happened between 1950 and 1959. There is something obnoxiously sneering about it, as if the film is bragging emptily and thoughtlessly about how more open, downtoEarth, and superior the 2000s are. Because the characters are such broad representations of popculture 1950s types, it is difficult to develop much emotional investment in them. Each has a few character traits thrown at him or her  Helen is obsessed with appearances, and Bill loves golf and his haunted by having had to kill his father  but they remain quite twodimensional. Performances within the constraints of this bad writing are fine. The best is Billy Connolly as Fido the zombie, who in the tradition of Boris Karloff in Frankenstein actually imparts character and sympathy to a lumbering green monster who cannot speak. There are little bits of unsubtle allegory thrown around  to commodity fetishism, racism, classism, war paranoia, et cetera, but none of it really works on a comprehensive level, and the filmmakers don;t really stick with anything.

Here is why As a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd, where action and gore and scares are taken into consideration, this movie WILL bore you. It is basically a family drama similar to what you would see on the Lifetime channel, but put in a horror universe. The story and formula are ageold, retreaded hundreds of times. If you are looking for any originality in the plot structure or the minimal conflicts, you will be disappointed. Take away the zombies and you will have something just as melodramatic as A Beautiful Mind, tripping on cheese. This is the 610.However, the basic synopsis and idea is pretty original and overthetop. It is literally something you and your friends would joke about when you are halfdrunk . . . but that joke actually got a theatrical release. The idea gets a 910 from me. The only reason it is not perfect is because they could have taken it even further, but they did not.The mix of both is mixed. I thought it was funny, but as with most all comedies, it was not THAT funny. I had my mom and little sister watch it with me and the jokes we made about it were funnier than the jokes scripted. There were moments of utter genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom.I sincerely hope that other movies take this kind of overthetop risk and original ideas.

How many more times do we have to be told the 50s in the States were infected with a banal sense of conformity? And that this was perpetuated by aggressive consumerism? And that emotional repression in men is a baaaaad thing? Old hat.Its biggest crime in my eyes though was just how detached from reality it was. I know it was a comedy and all, but  especially in a full movie where you must keep the interest of an audience for a prolonged period  you still need some sort of emotional anchor, some relatable guide through the story, to make it engaging. For the hero kid to watch an old woman, two fellow school pupils and ultimately his father die painfully at the hands of zombies or whatever and for him to greet it all with a cheery smile and a shrug of the shoulders, then I just struggle to deal with that in any sort of positive way. The mum was the same. If you make your two main characters so inhuman on that level, then you risk losing me and that is what happened.Biggest positive I can offer is that I love the look of that sort of apple pie suburbia and this captured it well enough, it was a handsome film, especially some of those wide angled shots of the street and inside the Robinsons house.

This is an amateur film with actors from Boston and shot around New Hampshire. For those living in New Engalnd and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital W. This film is full of flaws. You get to hear the directors voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress. OK now stand up. As for the other characters. There is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. The alien guy talks with a deep voice. When he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actors voice. As for the special effects, man! This was Brett Pipers early work for crying out loud! The creatures are good but the animation is jerky. Really jerky. Sort of like Karl Zeman animation in JOURNEY TO BEGINNING OF TIME 1955. The special effects are imaginative. Thge music is good. Bottom line, this film makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS look like a Ray Harryhausen epic. Did you know MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget?

Veery scary  not! This movie has a lot in common with Cold Creek Manor, another total loser.It is getting harder and harder to believe anything Hollywood puts forward about scary movies, since they rarely come through with anything original and spooky anymore.

Well, when I found Wendigo at the library, I checked it out hoping to be one of those films that had a supernatural being haunting people in the woods much like the stories that were told at camp. Well, much to my dismay, I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is really bad. The story starts of when a family of three is driving to their winter cabin, which looks like your normal suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods, and they run into a deer. Well, it seems the local rednecks were actually hunting this particular deer and are pretty upset at our city folk. The movie spends far too much time following the families everyday activities instead of getting to the point of the film. It was not until about the last 15 minutes that we actually have some action involving the wendigo. My suggestion is that you stay very far away this film.

The storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie. Someone mentioned that this film was about a childs imagination, okay thats all good and fine. But they still could have done better things with this script than what they did. I mean come on, the Indian in the store. Did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the Indian and the entire story about an Indian spirit called Wendigo? Which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here, so you think okay creepy ghost scenario, but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy. That was so lame it goes beyond pathetic. The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of OMG!!!

The shots are generic, conventional, and of television movie quality. The snow drenched scenery is gorgeous, yet the characters held with in it have a similar quality to that of looking at a photograph of such scenery, the overwhelming feeling being that of distance. Some of the editing is fairly high quality and the work of an veteran professional, the dialogue however is clunky and artificial, having little bearing on real conversations at all seemingly. Any emotional insight is displaced in favour of swearing, which is of course the way in which everyone shows their true feelings. The action is slow and underwhelming, the overall feeling being one of someone trickling cold water over your head, but so slowly that you barely notice, yet eventually you feel pathetic and slightly sorry for yourself for being caught in such a incomprehensible situation.The mixture of genres that the Fessenden has seemingly tried to use; psychological thriller, horror and family drama, although commendable suffers from a serious lack of tension and interesting dialogue. The way in which the husband, wife and child trio interact is particularly unrealistic. The themes of family relationships being played out in haunting setting have been covered countless times before by far superior films, an instant example being that of The Shining 1980. The family unit here are torn by innocuous troubles which are hard to understand or sympathise with considering the relative ambiguity of the script.The family unit is hardly stalked throughout the film, Fessenden playing down the thriller possibilities of the narrative in favour of a slow family drama for the majority of the running time. The stalker figure Otis has few apparent motives for his behaviour and despite being perhaps the most interesting and well acted character is still very underdeveloped. The main characters are empty husks of people who it was extremely hard to relate to, their relationships with each other being particularly void of any sentiment or feeling. Although the ignorance of the Erik per Sullivans young character by his parents is presumably part of the story, surely any reasonable person would question their son if he allegedly spoke to someone who seemingly does not exist? People can accept this film as intelligent because of its relative lack of conventional aspects regarding creature based horror movies but this film fails in respect of whichever genre you wished to pigeonhole it in. You can read deep psychological meanings into every single minute detail of anything if you should so wish to but I think people would be better off over analysing their carpet for some deep emotional meaning, rather than these vacuous subhuman creations.","label":0},{"index":4145,"txt":"I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing, he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor.

People who liked this film used words, like ambiguity and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that was not there. Like the Blair witch, people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying. This movie actually started off well with the family meeting the locals after hitting a deer. It looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes, well over half the film, nothing happened, the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining. It was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but Essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie. Finally, when something does happen, its not even clear how the father was shot, how he dies, the nurse said his liver was only grazed, and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects.

Luckily for use only a handful are given a theatrical release, while the others are being pushed straight to video or TV, such as this movie.The foremost problem of this movie is really its originality. It is one of those movies which uses the Die Hard formula of a tough but troubled guy being at the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case it is a character played by Casper Van Dien, who works for a security agency that thoroughly test safety procedures for companies and individuals. In this case he is being send to a cruise ship, which of course gets hijacked. You can see this movie as a sort of mix of Die Hard and Air Force One and the movie does not even try to conceal that those two movies were probably its biggest source of inspiration. So really, you cannot regard this movie as an original one at all. It uses all of the clich\u00e9s out of the book and this movie really does not offer any surprises or anything that remotely resembles anything original.Like you can expect from a movie such as this, it has a very weak script. Or rather said, it features some very lazy writing. Like I said before, the movie features nothing original but also the actual story itself features some elements which are far from likely and are just plain ridicules truthfully. I mean, hijacking an huge cruise ship with only about 8 guys, of which halve only carry some small guns and then ask for a ransom of only 10 million dollars, for a ship that is about worth 10 times that amount is itself already quite ridicules. How do they even intend to split that money afterward? Every person gets just over a million or something? That is hardly profitable for such a big and risky undertaking. And then there is the case of taking the passengers hostage. Somehow they manage to take all passengers on the huge ship hostage and they manage to put them inside one room, with only one guy with his pistol, which he cannot even seem to be able to hold right, watching them. You never see more than like 30 hostages however, as if they were all the people who were aboard at the time. Also when the Van Dien character goes looking for his son and vice versa, no matter which room they walk in through on the huge cruise ship, they always bump into each other instantly. Just some examples of the lazy writing within the movie.But it of course is an action flick, so the story of course becomes secondary. But then again, it is not as if this movie features any good action at all. Halve of the actors look as if they had never hold a weapon before and the movie is filled with some ridicules slowmotion. It really becomes laughable at points.Of course the movie also does not feature the best actors, though I must say that Casper Van Dien really is not a bad action hero and actor, as far as the genre and Bmovie circuit is concerned. He just however also suffers from the same problem as Tom Cruise; no matter how old he is, he just never looks convincing enough to play the father of a teenager. Van Dien once started out as a promising new young actor but starring in movies like this really does not help his career much.

Of course, there are extremes within those two broad categories. Films such as The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan, and Star Wars slot comfortably into the good category. At the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply do not deserve to be mentioned by name. Occasionally however, someone produces a truly woeful film. A film that should be singled out as a demonstration of how awful a film can be. A film that is more than bad. Such a film is Maiden Voyage.Briefly, Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil, scheming ships owner. Of course, there is an all American hero on board, complete with chiselled jaw and sculptured chest, who saves the day.This is a production that plumbs new depths. Everything about it is bad. The acting, the direction and the socalled plot are breathtakingly poor. In short, it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer. Even an American viewer would be annoyed by its shortcomings.Yes, it is that bad.I will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that angered me about this film. However, its dumberthandumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what I mean.Imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea. You are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb. Said hero throws the bomb to you and dives overboard. What would you do? I do not know about you, but I would throw the bomb as far as I possibly could into the sea. Not this guy. He watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate for him results. Enough said. Such a demise would merit a mention in the Darwin Awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production teams lives.","label":0},{"index":4164,"txt":"The cast of this film contain some of New Zealanders better actors, many of who I have seen in fabulous roles, this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them.

Released five years before the Broadway opening of Dreamgirls and partially set in the same period, it has a predominantly black cast and a story revolving around an upandcoming girl group, and that is where the resemblance basically ends. Written by Joel Schumacher well before he became a bigleague director of mainstream studio product Batman Forever, The Phantom of the Opera, this movie seems grittier on the surface. True to form, however, Schumacher weakens the storyline and character development by injecting an abundance of clich\u00e9s and eyerolling oneliners. With little affinity for staging musical numbers, Sam OSteen, a highly regarded film editor but neophyte director, helms the production like a lowbudget TVmovie with a frustratingly episodic structure.The story follows three Harlem sisters  sexy Sister, selfrighteous Delores and sweet Sparkle  as they sing in the church choir, meet smoothtalking but wellintentioned boys Stix and Levi, and then find their first taste of success as a singing group  first as a sweaterwearing quintet called the Hearts and then as a glitzy trio known as Sister and the Sisters. But naturally there are problems beyond the silly name for the group  Sister gets involved with nasty drug dealer Satin Struthers who beats her and turns her into a cocaine junkie; Levi goes to prison for getting caught in a drug pickup for Satin; Stix gets frustrated by failure and unwisely turns to some Jewish mobsters for financial help; Delores just gets plain fed up; and poor little Sparkle has to decide what kind of future she wants. A big plus is that RB great Curtis Mayfield wrote the atmospheric songs, some catchy and one, Look Into Your Heart, a real winner.The solid cast does its best under the contrived circumstances. Lonette McKees valiant attempt to make Sister a tragic figure is undercut by some of the hamfisted plot turns, including a sad Billie Hollidaylike turn at the mike. Before they hit it big on primetime TV, Philip Michael Thomas and Dorian Harewood portray Stix and Levi with boyish vitality if not much credibility. The best work comes from Mary Alice in a relatively silent turn as the girls patient mother and a preFame Irene Cara who effortlessly exudes sincerity in the title role though her costumer and hair stylist should be shot for the hideous look she achieves in the final scene. The DVD just comes with the original theatrical trailer complete with an unctuous voiceover by DJ Casey Kasem and a bonus CD of five of the films songs performed not by the original cast but by Aretha Franklin off her 1976 recording of the soundtrack.

I stress the word little since this is a very low budget flick, and there in lies its main weakness.The story takes place in the future. A world in which the great superpowers that according to this movie are the United States and Russia duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war...but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots. Our hero Achilles must go up against the evil Russian robot fighter called Alexander. Lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues.Well, the idea is awesome I guess. The great nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots? Interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the proper budget had been available. Unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director.I as a kid loved this movie, and I guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie, you will have to revert back to little kid mode to have some fun with it. I showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like what the hell is this piece of crap franco? And I am like well this movie is a scifi by one of my favorite directors Stuart Gordon? But as the movie progressed into corny territory I almost felt like pressing stop and not having them go through that torture. I could go through it, cause I loved this film as a kid, and there is still a little nostalgia attached to watching it. But everyone else was just not going to get it.And I myself realized that the movie is not really that good. First off. The movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other. And in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you would have to use some damn good special effects to make it work, expensive effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief. But unfortunately this being a small scale movie, from a small scale company Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after making this film!the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them. Heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed.OK granted, once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other. There are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool, and made me go thats why I liked thid movie! But every know and them, some crappy effect will take you right out of that protective little cocoon you were trying to hide in. And boom, your right back into realizing this film just does not live up to its premise.And heres another thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie. This movie is basically a movie for kids. You know, giant robots duking it out? Stop motion animation? Hello? But this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody. So I kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not? After a while I just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities, which really is not a good mix.So for those of you who do not feel that certain naive childlike charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you do not have a nostalgic connection to this movie like I do well Id suggest you steer clear away from this one. Gordons a great director, but this movie he made, just did not do it for me. Well, at least not now that I am a full grown adult.Rating 2 out of 5","label":0},{"index":4194,"txt":"This movie was, as Homer Simpson would have put it, more boring than church.

How many viewers understood that the husband agreed, in exchange for substantial financial remuneration, not to return to and reclaim his wife until Oswald was dead?2 The ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental. The original screenplay called for Maria to commit suicide after the reading of Oswalds will, on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide. Maria is then summarily blown up, rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her selfdelusion and moral compromise.3 Fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private, the political on the personal. Contrary to what the critics and experts assert, I do not think it works. Merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of German reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama. The selfish ambition of Marias rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the socalled economic miracle of postwar Germany. Maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place, but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific. Women have been asserting their independence by using sex for selfadvancement for ages. 4 Lastly, there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness  Fassbinders drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect. Unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen; music is clumsily intrusive in places; and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting.Strangely, for a movie condemning a country for willful collective amnesia of the holocaust, it itself never mentions it once.","label":0},{"index":4196,"txt":"This movie was packed pull of endless surprises!

I first saw this movie back in 197879 when I first subscribed to cable. In 1979 cable was just starting to become common place in homes. or at least that when it was becoming common here in Missouri.This might very well be the first movie I ever watched on the pay channel called The Movie Channel  which was called The Star Channel back then, they changed the name to The Movie Channel in the early 1980s........I received a free month of The Star Channel with my new cable subscription. The Van was one of the movies that was in heavy rotation on that network at that time.I remember watching this movie back then, and thinking it was a typical teen flickalong the same lines as other medium budget teen flicks ...the ones where the plot revolves around nudity and parties.I totally forgot that this movie even existed until I recently seen this movie again after having not seeing it for decades I found a copy of it on DVD for sale in cheap bin I recognized it, and bought it for a mere 4.99.Seems like I had remembered this film being much better that it wasis. However watching it back then was a different experience than watching now30 years later.It was fun to see the kids listing to rock n roll music, smoking weed, and having sex in the back a fancy vanoften all at the same time. This is what a good teen party movie should be.There is not much of a plot other than the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his arch rivals good looking girlfriend ...he blows all of his college savings money to purchase a tricked out Dodge Vanwith shag carpet walls . mirrored ceiling and a water bed in itto get her attention, and he eventually gets to have sex with her. But his arch rival finds out and comes looking for him so that the two of them can settle their differences by drag racing their vans....he and his arch rival end up wrecking both of their vans, and instead of stealing away his arch rivals girlfriend, he wins over the heart of a preppylesser attractive girl that he halfass dates through most of the movie and he decides he is happierbetter off and the movie ends.the movie does have it is funny moments. But watching this movie 30 years later, it becomes more of a trip down memory lane. Because I still can remember Pizza parlors, pinball arcades, It also brought back memories of cruising around a small town while we smoked pot as we would yell at good looking girls and hoping to get laid sometimes I would get lucky and get some decent looking girl to share a joint with me and we would screw in the backseat afterwords, I also remember many of the songs in this movewhen they were new......this movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era in those regards brought back lots of memoriesthe one thing that is depicted in this movie that I honestly can not remember is ....I never remember a time when full sized vans were as popular as this film depicts them as being. I remember that era very well, and I do not young men going around wishing they had a van. Instead I remember young men in the 70s self included wanting a Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy Camaro or a hot rod Ford Mustang, but never a van. This movie makes it appear as if vans were most popular item going and that every young man wanted onewhich just was not true of that era","label":0},{"index":4202,"txt":"The cult of personality has elevated the status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman etc. as kings of the Bs.

That is often taken as reference to the final scene, but more accurately describes how dead and buried this onceestimable series is after this sloppy and illogical sendoff.There is a hey kids, let us put on a show air about this telemovie, which can be endearing in spots. Some fans will feel like insiders as they enjoy picking out all the various cameo appearances. Cowriter, coproducer Tom Fontana and his pals pack the goingson with friends and favorites from other shows, as well as real Baltimore personages.That is on top of the returns of virtually all the members of the televisions show varied casts, your old favorites as well as later nonfavorites.There was always a tugofwar pitting qualityconscious executive producer Barry Levinson, Fontana, James Yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budgetconscious NBC execs, who simply wanted a another moronic police procedural like Nash Bridges, which regularly beat Homicide in the ratings. The pressure told as the show bounced between riveting realism that transcended its form, and sleazy sensationalism that demeaned it.Unfortunately for this movie, Fontana, cowriters Yoshimura and Eric Overmeyer and director Jean de Segonzac simply threw in the towel. They took the most ludicrous story are from the series, topped it with an unlikely and artistically unfruitful new plot line, and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast members.Briefly, some time has passed since the last episode of the show. The former heart of Baltimores homicide unit, Yaphet Kotto as Lt. Al Giardello, is now a Kurt Schmokelike candidate for mayor, and Schmoke himself makes a cameo appearance. But this promising start immediately and improbably takes a tragic turn.The spotlight shifts to Giancarlo Esposito as Giardellos son Mike. A handsome man who has done good work elsewhere, Esposito was one of the pretty faces brought in late to supposedly enliven the TV series. But the question for viewers always was is Mike that uncomfortable as Gees son, or is Esposito that uncomfortable in the role?To be fair, Esposito does not get a chance to play out the main story without interruption. That is because the writers choose this moment to revive another storyline that spat on the intelligence of the show is loyal voters.An apparent snuff streaming video was promoted, and then seemed to actually take place, on the Internet. After some red herrings, the detectives arrested a repellent suspect. But Zaljko Ivaneks harassed and overworked Deputy States Attorney forgot to file motions in time, and the suspect was released, only to be murdered later.Let us summarize he forgot to file the paperwork because it was not the most sensational case of his career, because the mayor, the attorney general, the governor, the entire Maryland Legislature, the U.S. Attorney General, NBC, Court TV, the BBC, AP, Reuters, People, The Sun, the Washington Post, the New York Times, the LA Times, Time Magazine, The Times of London, The Economist, The Johannesburg Mail and Guardian, LOsservatore Romano, Le Figaro, Paris Match, LEquipe and Computer World were not calling every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the case.Nevertheless, the old gang of detectives and associates flocks back to Baltimore to help out. There is quite an array of talent on display. Unfortunately, with the limited amount of dialogue to hand out, some of them are merely on display.Two of the strongest actors, Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, are criminally underused, while time wasted on Jon Seda and Michael Michelle could be better spent on commercials. The writers do seem to satirize this, presenting Jason Priestley as the latest bigdeal detective. On the other hand, they give easycome, easygo Michelle Forbes a very affecting scene.There is some other sly casting, with actual Lt. Gary DAddario, the center of the book that gave rise to the show, playing another detective. Guests drop in from other shows, like Whitney Allen doing her deadpan and clueless Miss Sally from the childrens show beloved by the inmates on Fontanas Oz. Dina Napoli of WBAL TV turns up as herself. Even when entertaining, though, these guests can be distracting. Ed Begley Jr. actually advances the story in his brief appearance, playing Dr. Victor Ehrlich from Fontanas St. Elsewhere. He is still a vivid character, and fits in a hospital setting. Then you remember, did not St. Elegius turn out to be an autistic boys fantasy?The most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy. This movie was made when Court TV bought rerun rights to the series. That network contributed legal waif Helen Lucaitis, who had interviewed the Homicide team and later appeared on Oz. The TV correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the news, that is, plot points for latecomers.Although she is so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways, Lucaitis also adeptly handles a bit of physical comedy with Esposito. He shows more juice in his scenes with Lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues. Perhaps those two should have done a spinoff.As the movie winds down, the cream of the cast rises to the top. Although they are saddled with a loser script, Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor overcome it. Their performances remind viewers what made Homicide, for considerable stretches, the best show on the air and one of the best television productions ever.It is fun to watch top pros do their stuff; it is just a shame this movie does not give them more of a chance. Diehard fans may want to see this movie anyway, but you can live without it.","label":0},{"index":4205,"txt":"Just like last years event WWE New Years Revolution 2006 was headlined by an Elimination Chamber match. The difference between last years and this years match however was the entertainment value. In reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York with the WWE Championship. Those men were current champion John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. There was no way Vinnie Mac would put the belt on any of the rookies; Carlito or Chris Masters. And Kane? Kane last held the WWE Championship in June 1998, and that was only for one night. It was obvious he was not going to be the one either. Last years match was a thrilling affair with six of the best WWE had to offer. 2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by far.The only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event. Out strolled Vince McMahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber. It was then announced that Edge was cashing in his money in the bank championship match right then and there. With no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the Elimination Chamber match John Cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining heels in WWE. This was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all night.The undercard, like last year, was truly atrocious. Triple H and The Big Show put on a snore fest that had me struggling to stay away. HHH picked up the win but that was never in any real doubt was it? Any payperview that has both Jerry Lawler and Viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success really does it. The King pinned Helms who books this stuff? and Big Vis tasted defeat against the wasted Shelton Benjamin with a little help from his Mama.The women of the WWE also had a busy night. There was the usual Diva nonsense with a Bra and Panties Gauntlet match which was won by Ashley and the Womans Championship was also on the line. In a match, I thought would have been left to brew till WrestleMania 22 Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good match. Trish won the contest but it was evident that this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.The opening contest of the night pitted soon to be WWE Champion Edge against Intercontinental Champion, Ric Flair. This could have been better but it was a battered and bloody Flair that retained after a disqualification finish. Edge obviously had bigger fish to fry.So New Years Revolution kicked off the 2006 payperview calendar in disastrous fashion.

However, towards the end of the series, it was obvious that the studio had jumped the shark, so to speak. This phrase indicates that a TV show has passed its prime and the executives in charge decided to invigorate the show by fundamentally changing the formula. For example, with The Brady Bunch they introduced the annoying Cousin Oliver and with Family Ties they introduced a freak baby who grew up six years in only one season! With the Moto films, they would jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films needed to be retooled. In the previous film, Warren Hymer played an annoying wrestler. And, in this film the character Archibald Featherstone appears. Featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever, as you kept hoping someone preferably Moto would kill him just to shut him up!! Although he is supposed to work for the famed Scotland Yard, he shows all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip. Again and again, his scenes were boorish and unnecessary and Peter Lorre just looks pained as he stands there and watches this buffoon act. It is so bad that it truly destroys what COULD have been one of the better Moto films due to its clever plot.As for the plot, the crown of the Queen of Sheba is discovered in the opening scene. Moto, now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he originally was, is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen. In a great twist, several thieves all try to steal the crown independently of each other.Overall, the film is watchable but is also ample evidence that the Moto series should have ended here.

Keaton was still in his comedy mode by this time. But he gives a credible performance all the same as he could prove that he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not embarrass himself but Director Ron Howard cannot keep this from becoming a TV movie which it ends up being anyway because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending the politics and problems of Japanese and American relations not withstanding. Gung Ho has a Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley feel to it as the producers of both TV shows made the film and then made the TV version of this movie as well which gives the film its lightweight feel.The Japanese manager gets to love his American workers and feels he and other Japanese people can learnfrom Americans.His No.2 man Saito who supposedly does not like Americans all that much does not think so.I would have prefered all the Japanese characters been like Saito than the soft goofball characters they made the Japanese out to be.It would have made the film more interesting.","label":0},{"index":4216,"txt":"There are laughs in this film, that is for sure.

While it is not the greatest Picasso any threeyearold has ever accomplished with their fingers, you encourage them to do more. If painting is what makes them happy, there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child. Typically, if a child loves to paint or draw, you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style. You will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles. Well, this concept of childrens artwork is how I felt about Fuquas depressingly cheap and uncreative film Bait. While on all accounts it was a horrid film, it was impressive to see Fuquas style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments. If you have seen either Training Day or King Arthur, you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film Bait. While Foxx gives a horrid, unchained performance, there are certain scenes, which define Fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera. Sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film, but if you focus just on those scenes, you will see why Fuquas name appears on so many Best Of\u0085 film lists.I will never disagree with someone that Fuquas eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique. His ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking. I am surprised that more of Hollywood has not jumped aboard this bandwagon. Even in the silly feature Bait, you are witness to Fuquas greatness. Two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end. In both of these scenes I saw the director Fuqua at work. Alas, in the rest of this film, all I saw was a combination of nearly every action film created. The likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in Hollywood. We have seen this two often, and no matter who you are unless you are Charlie Kaufmann, you cannot recreate the wheel. It is just impossible with this genre, and it is proved with Bait. I was annoyed with Fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen, which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film. I was just tired of the structure, and while I hoped that Fuqua would redefine it, he did not.Then, there was the acting. While Jamie Foxx has never impressed me as an actor, I was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try. I wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to Collateral. I was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that Foxx could handle the role in Collateral. Again, I was disappointed. Foxx was annoying. Not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be, but in the sense that it felt as if neither Fuqua nor Foxx took the time to fully train Foxx on what should be adlibed and what should be used to further the plot. Instead, we are downtrodden with scene over scene of Foxx just trying to make the audience laugh. Adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first, an actor second. Fuqua should have stopped this immediately. Foxxs jokes destroyed his character, which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of. Instead of character development, he would crack a joke. Neither style worked, no joke was funny. The rest of the cast was average. By this I mean I have seen them all in similar roles. They were brining nothing new to the table, nothing solid to the story, and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film. They were pawns filling in dead air space. Fuqua had no control over this mess, and the final verdict only supports that accusation.Overall, this was a sad film. With no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves, what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand. Foxx was annoying, without character lines, and a complete bag of cheese. In each scene I saw no emotion, and when emotion was needed to convey a message, he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues. Are my words harsh? I do not think so. When you watch any movie you want to see some creativity, some edible characters, and themes that seem to hit close to home. Bait contained none of these. While I will give Fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film, the remaining five hundred were disastrous. Apparently, I took the bait when renting this film, but now having seen it, hopefully I can stop others from taking that curious nibble.Grade  out of  for his two scenes that were fun to watch","label":0},{"index":4233,"txt":"Well I watched this last night and the one thing that did not make it completely terrible is that it was straight forward.

Whenever I see The Asylum is responsible for a film I get worried, I get very worried since their track record is awful. They seem to specialise in making or distributing low budget horror films which are usually ripoffs of some recent successful big budget horror film  in the case of 666 The Child you do not need a degree in rocket science to realise that it is a complete ripoff to cash in on the recent The Omen 2006 which was released the same year. The script by Benjamin Henry  Austin Laurel is terrible  simply cannot match the ambitions of the the Hollywood equivalent, I mean just what exactly does Donald the Antichrist expect to achieve from a middle class family in a small town? It is hardly a great starting point to bring about the destruction of thew world is it? Every character in 666 The Child is some form of the main characters from The Omen, the adopted parents, the Priest who tries to warn them  the sinister babysitter. There is a real lack of incident, there is barely any gore  the plot is poor. I mean Donald killing a dentist because they were trying to fix his teeth is just so random  needless, what were all the disgusting pictures Donald drew all about, where did the babysitter come from  there is just nothing that ties everything together  it is just a disjointed mess that just becomes very boring very quickly. The references to the number 6 also becomes annoying  are very unsubtle.Director Perez does alright I suppose, it is competent if nothing else. There is virtually no blood or gore, there is a few sprays of blood, a cut off hand  someone gets a circular saw stuck in their face but it sounds a lot better than it looks on screen. It is certainly not scary, there is no atmosphere thanks to a throughly bland contemporary setting in a suburban house  there is no tension because we never really know what Donald is trying to do  there fore there is no threat from him.Technically the film is alright, it is reasonably well made but since the actual film is so poor it makes little difference. The acting is not that great but at the same time I have seen worse.666 The Child is a poor mans The Omen ripoff, I would sooner watch either the original or the remake over this any day of the week.

The overall movie is mercifully short already, but this could have been made up for by giving a little more attention to the Mean Lion how did the miss a reference to The Wiz on that one? and working his subplot a little more closely into the main plot. In short, the script had the seed of a good idea, but needed quite a bit of reworking.Second, it could have done without the crude humor. The original also had some that it could have done without, but at least there it was almost an afterthought  here, flatulence and urination abound.Third, the show is a little too selfaware. The original series had that well enough, as did the first movie, but here it is just way, way too much. The Brendan Fraser injokes were just a bit over the top and why no mention of the new Ursula?. Other gags with the Narrator, especially a couple of interactions near the end, also exceed good sense.Fourth, a bit more attention could have been given to the CGI work. In the first it was hard to tell that Shemp was not a real elephant except by behavior, of course, but here the CGI stands out like a sore thumb. Ideally special effects should merely tell the story whether they are good or bad, and they at least do succeed on that count, so it is a relatively small problem, but it is still there.All that said, Christopher Showermans performance as George is decent enough. It lacks Brendan Frasers charm, but Christopher only really fails in that specific comparison  he even managed to give George a bit of personal depth, which should have been a major foul in a Jay Wardinspired movie but was not here.

He would have been better off working with more of the Kubricks of the film world than the people he did. Of his later films, only The Optimists of Nine Elms and Being There have impressed me of those I have seen.That said, the Boultings and Sellers had made a few films prior to this that hardly sound that bad  I have yet to see Carlton Browne and Heavens Above!  at least in the sense of using Sellers well to a degree. But, There is a Girl in My Soup really is a poor film and a dire choice on Sellers part in terms of character. In his films from 195564, you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles. Here, you have Peter Sellers trying to play a typical romantic lead. It is almost Sellers playing a Niven cad without the joviality. He certainly does not convince, try as he might, or create an interesting character. He should have left such parts to masters of suavity such as Cary Grant, and concentrated on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles that he was famed for.Hawn and Sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry; this is no easy, genial romance of the like perfected by William Powell and Myrna Loy. It is very artificial seeming, all the way through  I know that it is part of Danvers character that he is a dry procurer of ladies, but he does not really change from that in a way that convinces. Sellers has a very grating way of playing charm as well... this character really has no depth, and really does not gain the viewers sympathy or interest. Sellers goes through the motions in a way one would not think possible when remembering the magnificence of his shifty, iconoclastic performance in Lolita.There really is nothing to say about the plot, direction or characters, as frankly they leave little or no impression.

I guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times, in terms of it is definite experimentalism and all around unconventionality, the problem is the quality is completely shot and the writing, not to mention the direction is just so out there. Peter Sellers in particular is very hit and miss, he will go from Dr. Strangelove and Being There throughout his career, to dumb movies like this and the Magic Christian, which was very similar to this one in context and style, but that movie did have a few funny moments. This one is senseless, and I am sad that someone as great as Peter Sellers was in this movie. Not recommended for anyone.","label":0},{"index":4246,"txt":"this movie delivers. the best is when the awkward teenage neighbor tries to bike away from the babysitter and in the background looks like he is never been anywhere near a bike in his life as he attempts not to fall off.but this movie does not stop there, when less than 5 minutes later it delivers a scene of nothing but an arm reaching through a fence and into a cooler pulling out a beer. stereotypical grilling dads, several plot lines that go nowhere, and a former seaQuest actress with a bluetooth cell phone all add up to making this the perfect Saturday night at home.","label":0},{"index":4247,"txt":"If you have plenty of time to waste ... it is OK.

The acting was not horrible but nothing to rave about.One highlight I am a longtime fan of General Hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by former GH regular, Jon Lindstrom.Anyway, if you can overlook the bogus psychoanalytical part of it, in the same way a person must suspend reality  judgment when watching a lot of movies, then this movie might be tolerable.

CoC had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative setpieces. The locations in TSoTG are not very vivid or engaging. Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen do not even provide decent sideshow entertainment this time. It is like they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing. The DVD is in fullframe with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. But one curious thing.

And there he must face an harsh new life, confined to a wheelchair. It is an interesting, and promising premise, but unfortunately, it fails to deploy. What ensues instead is largely Hollywood schmaltz, with some interesting moments. Certainly the cast Eric Stoltz, William Forsythe, Wesley Snipes, et al is brilliant, and perform well here as one would expect, but their talents are wasted. The characters are mainly stereotypes of one kind or another, and most of them are thoroughly unlikeable the Snipes character being the exception. I suppose this is some kind of attempt to break through peoples ideas about the handicapped being crippled or weak, by depicting them, for the most part, as inyourface pricks, but it makes for an entirely annoying experience. Admittedly it will show you something of what those with permanent disabilities go through, in a way that is not softened or romanticized, which is useful, and a good idea, but while the process being depicted can make one a difficult person to get along with, and that is worth dealing with, it is not part and parcel to that that these characters must be, to varying degrees, despicable. They would not have to be Disneyfied, either; surely there is a middle ground somewhere. By the films conclusion, the Eric Stoltz character has come to accept his status as a handicapped person, but since he is such a flaming narcissistic monster from the beginning of the film to the end, we could not care less. In addition to its character problems, the film suffers from that weird syndrome that so many Hollywood movies suffer from; the syndrome does not really have an official name, but you might call it Inexplicable Forgiveness Syndrome. It goes something like this characters abuse the crap out of each other, and then without so much as an apology, all is forgiven an especially obnoxious example of this is in the movie The Breakfast Club, in which one character spends most of the film verbally bullying everybody within earshot; as a result\u0085they love him. In one of the the latest examples, Spiderman 3, supervillain The Sandman lays waste to a chunk of Manhattan, then wails on Spiderman for what seems like about 15 monotonous minutes before being waved off with what amounts to bye, now. The most egregious example of IFS in The Waterdance is a sequence in which, after being called the nword by William Forsythe is racist biker character and his friends in the previous scene, the Wesley Snipes character whoops it up with the same Forsythe character in the next scene, as if nothing had just happened just a short time hence. Again, without so much as an Oh yeah, sorry about that business back there where I, you know, called you the nword. It makes me wonder, do these people actually watch these movies before they release them, or do they just film them with their eyes closed, kind of slap them together in the editing room according to scene number, and call it a days work?","label":0},{"index":4251,"txt":"This story had a different angle that intrigued me, enough to buy a previouslyviewed VHS sightunseen.

He is a lot of fun to be around. Then, there is Raymond Hill Wesley Snipes, a fasttalking womanizer. Snipes must have liked those fasttalking hip arrogant roles because he played in a number of them, like in White Men Cannot Jump. Then there is sweet Helen Hunt playing Anna that wonderful caring, loving person who is having an adulterous affair with the leading character in the film, Joel Garcia Eric Stoltz.Yup, this is heartwarming, feelgood type stuff.

And lastly why did anyone think that it deserved to be released into theaters where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you live when it should have gone straight to the discount bin at Blockbuster or Wal Mart?There is so much wrong with this movie that I cannot write a really comprehensive review of it because it would exceed the maximum allowed words on this forum so I will just touch on the biggest things wrong with it.The plot is generic uninspired and stupid and characters are all about as interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minutes but the biggest thing that I can see wrong with this movie is the acting.While most of the cast are talentless no namers who will probably be forgotten in a few years,the one and only big name in this movie is Eugene Levy who spends almost all of the time he is on screen with this knowing smirk on his face that says to the viewer I know this is not funny and I am wasting my talents but hey I am getting payed for it so who cares he does not even try to make any of his jokes funny he really deserves better than this garbage. As I mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are horrible even though some of them have been in some really great TV shows, Tyrone Savage from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back plays a character who is so unbearable unlikeable and irritating there are things that he could teach to tropical skin diseasesthat you almost wish he would die a slow and painful death on screen, Christopher McDonald NCIS, Law  Order just hangs around on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this film.Maybe the next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line so they can get around the MPAA and get an R rating this movie goes all out with pointless nudity vulgarity and pointlessly offencive sexual content that it should have gotten the X rating the ratings board must have been drunk or on drugs when they reviewed this film for its rating. It is interesting that twenty five years ago when Wes Craven submitted A Nightmare On Elm Street to the MPAA for a rating review they forced him to cut twenty five seconds of footage I believe that it was part of a death scene that had a silicone casting of a breast in it to avoid getting an X rating and he had no other choice but to do it or the film would not have been released, but this kind of needlessly offensive trash can get the R rating today because it is all done in the name of comedy, if this movie was a drama or horror film with this kind of content there would have been a huge stink over the content and it would havegotten the dreaded X rating.The last thing that really annoys me is the writing, this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old kid with an extremely overactive sexual imagination its quite juvenile and extraordinarily crass, nearly every expository situation that is supposed to move the corpse that this movie calls a plot along is so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and and the so called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes, never mind the often repulsive sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior it feels like this film was written by some incompetent first year hack in a low rent film school script writing class.the long and short of it is its time to kill this series before it gets any stupider more crass and offensive, this pie is filled with road apples.","label":0},{"index":4257,"txt":"Just finished watching American Pie Beta House and I gotta say, this was such a garbage pile of crap.

You got it! The reason she appears is so pointless though that it really sets the tone for the rest of this piece of juvenile crap.

I have watched many a movie franchise decline over the years, but American Pie;Beta House has to be one of the worst offenders when you consider that despite the average nature of the original movie, it is still a thousand times funnier than this dreck.The plot is predictable, and sometimes you actually feel like you are watching a school play. The things that happen in this movie are so unrealistic that it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to actually watch it we are talking Star Wars levels of suspension, like the kind you need to convince yourself Jar Jar is realThe plot is paper thin and mostly the events that transpire are only there to show another pair of breasts or set up yet another pathetic joke. There is no acting talent to speak of, all you get is a bunch of pretty boys trying to make us laugh. And ohhh how they fail!!!! Every gag falls flat and the only thing I laughed at was how socially unaware the scriptwriters appear to be. How else can you explain the bullst they try to pass off as a story?They pass up every opportunity to do something worthwhile and entertaining in favour of badly written, lowest common denominator nonsense. The characters have to complete a set number of tasks before they are accepted as members of Beta House, but this is dealt with mostly by a series of very brief montages that imply that they are completing the tasks but we see little to no evidence of it actually happening. Its a very lazy way of telling a story. It also misses opportunities to be funny in doing so.Imagine say The Wizard of Oz where all the important events happened offscreen instead of on it, and all we see is Dorothy highfiving the Scarecrow every now and again and saying Gee that sure was a great adventure we just had back then Lazy. Lazy. LAZY!!!!The female characters have little or nothing to say. All they do is get naked for no apparent reason and are used as visual props through most of the movie.

First of all, the story has a very stale arc structure. First, there is the introduction of the characters, then the pledging of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each of which has exactly 25 minutes of length. Apart from the general staleness of the plot, there is little to no character development, which makes a double whammy of a bad plot.Apart from that, I deeply disliked the stereotyping in this film. That is, showing the jocks as the extremely cool, onlythinkingaboutsex guys, and explicitly displaying the geeks as inferior. Also, it shows females only as sexual objects, and males as only wanting to treat the females as sexual objects.Apart from that, the acting was also poor. With perhaps the exception of Steve Talley.So, in the end, a generally horrid film, if seen from a critical point of view.

Crazy stuff happens, people run around naked and nerds are made fun of and this series is dead in the water. The Naked Mile was a crap film, but I found it to be significantly better then Band Camp. It seems they have gone back to what did not work for them and it shows that they do not care either. You can tell where the target audience is and they nailed it perfectly. Young teenage boys who like to see naked women, crude humour and beer drinking will love Beta House, everyone else can pretty much look away.Star Wars became a massive success that stunned audiences with it is ahead of its time special effects. Lord of the Rings created an entire world of mythical creatures and massive battles that dazzled the eye. The Matrix changed the way action and scifi films were made, specifically with the cutting edge special effects. With all the advancement in technology, we eagerly await the next big thing that will have our jaws dropped to the floor. Then comes American Pie Beta House, which pushes the boundaries of what technology can do. When people have created spaceships, landscapes and creatures using CGI, Beta House decides to use this technology to create semen. Yes, the thing that creates life, the thing you see so many times in pornography films is created and time slows down to show us the white residue shoot across the room onto a teddy bear. Is this funny? Disgusting? Neither? Beta House shows more nudity then The Naked Mile, which is surprising considering the previous installments title. Does the film need it? Of course not, does it ever advance the plot, does it ever? Does it ever get a laugh? Does it ever get young boys aroused? Yes the women are beautiful, but if I am the one who thinks there is too much nudity then you might as well just have made a porno.The female who catches the affections of our main character is pretty and does not annoy the viewer, like previous girls have done in the series, but not once did I ever believe this character would ever do what she does. I am pretty sure every action from the characters in this film are far from realistic. The American Pie series has fallen from a realm of reality into a fantasy world. None of the events in this film would ever happen, if they ever did then I need to attend this school IMMEDIATELY. Is this film suppose to make people feel like they are having a good time? Well it does not, we are watching them have a good time, by the end of the film we hate them for all the fun they are having.There is a Deer Hunter scene in the film, but to make it funny for todays audience they decided to substitute bullets wit horse semen. Are you laughing yet? Instead of shooting themselves with said semen in the head, or face, they place the gun in their mouths. Are you on the floor laughing yet? The first time we are introduced to Stiflers roommate, he is having sex with his girlfriend. Are you cheering at the nudity yet? The film at first seems like it will be about the boys trying to get into the frat house, but then it shifts to them already being in the frat house, but needing to perform certain tasks. Then it shifts to a competition between nerds and the boys. It goes a little Revenge of the Nerds on us for a bit and it seems out of place. I honestly do not know what these film is about because it goes all over the place.Most of the comedy seems forced for shock value. Even at the beginning with the Dad showing his son the list of people he has had sex with. The joke is in there somewhere, I think it might be the fact that his wife is not the last name on the list, or it could have been that one of his sons friends mother was on the list. Either one, it does not work.I guess if you have not guessed it yet, this film is not funny. Nor does it seem to be focused, the story is pathetic and the so called crude humour that the series has been known for does not shock. Skip this lame installment and any future ones as well.

On the one hand, it is a comedy with no plot and few genuinely clever jokes. On the other hand, it is porno that is a tad too softcore to actually turn on any viewers. Essentially Beta House is a collage of sex scenes  some humiliating, others just lame attempts at humor  with a couple thin plot points thrown in an effort at cohesiveness. The characters are barely even twodimensional, most development relies on knowledge of Naked Mile, and the important plot scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the writers even felt the need for a story.In all fairness, I did not go into this movie without expectations. I liked the original three American Pie movies, and thought Band Camp and Naked Mile were solid rentals. I thought Naked Mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters, and so when I saw that some of the same characters were returning for Beta House, I was excited to see this installment. I was aware that there would be numerous scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple forms. And I was fine with it, because in the past, these scenes were backed by the story and were well integrated into the plot. In Beta House, however, it is almost as if the writers forgot why the formula in the other AP movies worked. They spent too much energy working in the nudity that they forgot to actually write a story.This movie is a disappointment and not even worth a onedollar rental.

After being a prodigy child actress she descended into obscurity with mediocre films of low quality. While she has recovered from that dark past, this movie stays as a reminder of Drew Barrymores worst days.The movie starts with an interesting premise, very reminiscent to Brian De Palmas Raising Cain; with a plot dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets the story for a horrorthriller. Barrymore stars as Holly Gooding, a young woman who is trying to make a new life in California after a traumatic event of her past in which apparently her other personality killed her mother.Suddenly, her past returns to haunt her as her evil personality is back in her life willing to ruin her new found peace and her new found love. In the middle of the chaos his new boyfriend, Patrick Highsmith George Newbern, will try to help Holly to face the demons of her past.Unlike De Palmas underrated thriller, Doppelganger is for the most part a mediocre film that not only never fulfills it is purpose, it also concludes in one of the worst endings of movie history. While Barrymore is definitely not at her best, she manages to keep her dignity with an above average performance. The rest of the cast however range from mediocre to painfully bad overthetop performances, although Leslie Hope manages to be among the best of them.The script is full of clich\u00e9s and De Palmas influence is quite obvious. While the movie tries to be original by making literary references in almost every line, the dialogs are dull and the wooden acting certainly does not do any good. It has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons, and excessive use of special effects.The makeup effects are done by the outstanding KNB and are really among the few good things in the movie. However, the bizarre overuse of the effects in the totally out of context ending decreases the impact of KNBs work and makes cheesy what in a different movie would be amazing.The fact that this is a BMovie is no excuse for it is low quality, as with a better and more coherent script this could had been an interesting movie.

I think the reason why these movies do not work is because 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon, it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults. This was not really that fun because it is adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings, I understand they are trying to make sure that it is appealing to the kids, but it is ridicules to see the way these actors are behaving in the film.

And I wish I could blame it on yet another bland performance from Basinger not only do I feel she is one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but I am still steaming more than a decade later that she was the only one, and definitely the only bad actor in the film, to win an acting Oscar for L.A. Confidential. But she was not the only problem. Sutherland, who I love as Jack Bauer on 24 once again plays\u0085Jack. I miss his old A Time to Kill or A Few Good Men days. Douglas certainly took a hiatus from acting and phoned this one in. Plot Someone, some Secret Service traitor, wants the President dead and Douglas is haphazardly being framed. Will someone believe him? Actually, no spoiler here as quickly as they came up with that subplot halfway through, it is over before you know it. And why did someones want the President dead? Is that to be revealed in the sequel? Too many plot holes, too many doors opened and never closed and too predictable The Sentinel is. If you only see one movie a year, you may not know who the mole is, but anyone who is familiar with these types of movies or even just seen one Law  Order episode you will know in the first few frames.

It looked like a classic action thriller like the ones made in 1990s. It recalled me also Fugitive movies, a cat and mouse chase between Douglas and Sutherland. However, The Sentinel is the most tasteless action thriller of all time. As I see, many people say that this is like a TV movie. Not exactly. Firstly, there are much more better TV movies in this genre. Secondly, TV movies might be very fun sometimes, but this film is the exact opposite of having a good time. It is not stylish at all visually and the most important, the tone of the movie is unappealing. This is not an action movie, there are two action scenes consist of a chase and a clash. Also they are not big action scenes, but the worse is that those action scenes are very tasteless like the whole movie. The love affair between Douglas and Bassinger was very unnecessary. Besides, the assassination plot to the president is the most clich\u00e9 story in this genre either, but they insist on that. And this is not a cat and mouse film as it is supposed to be. Although, Douglas is very old now, he has still potential for acting in an action thriller. In the film, Michael Douglas cannot be like Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is a wrong choice either, because you feel as if you watch Jack Bauer and somehow, its character is one of the reasons which make the film like a TV movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice, of course she is too passive or straight in this movie, because she is a soap opera actress.

The Sentinel is a rehash of several better films, like In The Line Of Fire this does not have any originality in it, and watching Michael Douglas run around, felt kinda silly in my opinion. The Main problem besides it is unoriginality, had to be the poor pace. I often got distracted while trying to view this movie, while looking how much run time was left, more then once. Not only the miscasting with Eva Longoria, who could not convince worth a lick.Performances. Michael Douglas is usually a dependable actor, here is obviously going through the motions. He does not convince as a man on a run, or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger, was also off. I am a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here he is only OK, nothing more then that. He tries to come across as a gruff, but managed to be more bland then anything else, and to be honest, he did not seem that interested. Eva Longoria Parker is pretty mediocre. She does not convince in her role, and was pure eye candy. Kim Basinger is pretty terrible as the 1st lady. She looks bored to tears, and her role is a throw away, more then anything else. Martin Donovan has a big part in the end, but not enough to matter for me.Bottom line. The Sentinel is yet, another political thriller, that bored me to tears.

I am not referring to the plot twist that surprised me, but instead the effortless manner that they put together what could be considered the ONLY scene of somewhat decent action in the entire movie. They rushed the ending so quickly that I did not even realize that it was over until I saw the credits rolling and at that point i considered burning the reel of film if I could just figure out how to get into that screening room.Casting was awful for a few reasons. First of all, they must have accidentally switched the character assignments, because Michael Douglas played the roll that CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland should have been playing. While Douglas was sneaking around agents, tapping phone lines, hacking into systems and taking out people who are chasing after him, Sutherland plays the less capable agent who is always in a bad mood even when things are not going that badly for him. He plays a very bland agent, nothing like his Jack Bauer type roll us 24 fans love.I can just about promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas.

His only confidant is the First Lady, and she is reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for one another which is why Pete failed the polygraph in the first place. But is Pete really innocent? Or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the President? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while running from the Secret Service? The one, big, overwhelming problem with this film is that there is no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat. Is not that what the movies supposed to be about? One would think so! But the audience is never let in on why the assassins want to kill the Prez. Hmm. Someone forget to put that in the script somewhere? And what is with David Breckinridges Kiefers new partner, Jill Marin Eva Longoria, CARLITAS WAY? Seems that she was put in the film strictly as a piece of acandy. What was her purpose again?

One of the reasons why I was so impressed with Foxxs performance in Ray was because from watching his hammy, obnoxious acting in movies like Bait and Booty Call, I would never imagine he would ever hold the Oscar. If people told me five years ago that Jamie Foxx was one day going to win an Oscar, I would laugh right in their faces. Who knows? Maybe he is better off sticking to drama, because if you watch Bait, it is clearly evident that comedy is not his forte. I swear, Jamie mugs so much in this movie that I am surprised his face did not fall off. And why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets? Anyone familiar with comedians like Bob Newhart and Steven Wright knows that doing comedy does not require being loud and obnoxious. If a joke is funny, it is funny. If it is not funny, then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier. The problem I have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character. In real life, normal people do not always have witty comebacks and quips. Like Albert Brooks said in an interview discussing his character in Taxi Driver, it is important to be funny as your character, rather than be funny as a comedian. A prime example of Jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken, and he starts posing for the photographs like a model. If a regular person were being thrown in jail, would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken? And would not the police try to scold him if he was? There are many scenes like that throughout the film. Another awful sequence is one where Jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain, and he starts doing a phony Caribbean accent. Not funny! Not to mention Jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke. Giving a comedic performance requires patience, whereas he goes straight to the punchline, whether it is the right time for it or not. I am not even a big Mike Epps fan, but even his performance is good in comparison to Jamies. As a matter of fact, this is the first time I felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen. Epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy, but at least he chooses a more lowkey approach. One of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is David Morse, a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains. He seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality. However, fellow Green Mile star Doug Hutchison is disgustingly overthetop as the villain. A big surprise, considering he gave a superb performance in The Green Mile, also playing a heavy. Antoine Fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like The Replacement Killers and Training Day. Even in Bait, he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence. His only problem seemed to be in disciplining Jamie Foxx, who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another.

If his faggoty boyfriend hanging all over him does not make you sick, then be thankful the freak who wrote andor directed this grossout is somehow attempting a little restraint. I mean, get real. It is one thing for there to be a gay character appearing in a movie in such screwed up times as these but quite another to have it continually slapped on the screen and examined up close and personal when the the liner notes clearly state the flicks supposed to be about a mother seeking some sort of closure over the sudden death of her daughter. What does one thing have to do with the other, one might be tempted to ask? Apparently, the two issues are inextricably interwoven. And if that were not bad enough, there is the bearded lady at the ice cream parlor. I mean, seriously, has not that poor woman ever heard of electrolysis? Why must she go around like that? At the very least, how about shaving the ugly thing off, and while you are at it, have those horrible moles removed, too. Would YOU slurp up some ice cream she just served you? I think not.

Unfortunately, this did not happen.Of course the audience may have been able to make sense of this convoluted tale, a credit to the ingenuity of the human brain to make sense of the absurd. The writers, however, did NOTHING to facilitate this innate need we seem to have for finding meaning.It was apparent that those involved were simply going through the motions of their respective crafts, and that any intrinsic passion for the characters or the story was either secondary or nonexistent.Unfortunately, madeforTV movies have seemed to devolve over the years.

She cleans the house, sleeps for two days and then begins to reveal things which were better not to be revealed. It appears that sweet Sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy who ultimately married the latter. In addition, she had an abortion thanks to this guy. We are all now put on this guilt trip.Her only hope is to find the elusive diary that Sara kept. She also hopes that boyfriend,Adam, who is a playwright, will not include all this in another play.When the diary is found, it has been written in Japanese. Sara had a Ph.D in this language. It is not that great news for mom when an excerpt of the diary is translated by a Japanese cook in a Japanese restaurant.Naturally, everything seems to tie up nicely in the end. The title of this shmaltz comes from The Wizard of Oz. Every time mom and Sara would speak, they would both utter Surrender Dorothy.As if this is not enough, during the course of this bizarre extravaganza of mourning, Keaton tells Adam not to be another Woody Allen in his film, Interiors, where he tried to successfully emulate Ingmar Bergman.

When the daughter died, the only thing I thought was, At least we will not have to watch her anymore.

As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and REALLY knowing the pain, I had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who think they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child. This movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of Diane Keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child. It was VERY unrealistic from start to stop. I had a few calls after the movie, each call the same, That was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back What a bunch of bull!

A single mother, grieving the sudden death of her twentysomething daughter, imposes uponand gradually becomes friends withthe group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident. Adapted from the novel, this teleplay gives us a group of selfabsorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid. Aside from being coarse and dim, these phony people are incredibly unconvincing, as is the tidy scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the kids reside one young man, who wears muscle shirts to tell us he is gay, hears Diane Keaton say, Surrender, Dorothy and actually asks, That is from The Wizard of Oz, right?...no, genius, it is from Citizen Kane!. Keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death. She tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage lots of kooky outfits, but it does not sit well with the viewer since Keaton has always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way. Here, she is a crazed harpy who does not learn many lessons on her journey of selfdiscovery the movie quickly forgets it is about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom, who appears to be an overage hippie who has never lost anyone close to her. This is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the caveat, It should help a lot of grieving mothers out there.

The audience first sees some man in Jack the Ripper garb murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago. Then we are up to modern day and a young Australian couple is looking for a house. We are given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror. Some 105 year old woman lived there. There are also large iron panels covering a wall in the den. An old fashioned straightrazor falls out when they are renovating and the husband keeps it. I guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams. Oh yeah, the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing blanks. Some mold seems to be climbing up the wall after the couple removes the iron panels and the mold has the shape of a person. Late in the story there is a plot about a large cache of money  the husband murders the body guard  a coworker and steals the money. His wife is suddenly pregnant. What the hell is going on?? Who knows?? NOTHING is explained. Was the 105 year old woman the child of the serial killer? The baby sister? WHY were iron panels put on the wall? How would that keep the serial killer contained in the cellar? Was he locked down there by his family  starved to death or just concealed? WHO is Mr. Hobbs and why is he so desperate to get the iron panels?? He is never seen again. WHY was the serial killer killing people? We only see the one old man murdered. Was there a pattern or motive or something?? WHY does the wife suddenly become pregnant? Is it the demon spawn of the serial killer? Has he managed to infiltrate the husbands semen? And why, if the husband was able to subdue and murder a huge, burly security guard, is he unable to overpower his wife? And just how powerful is the voltage system in Australia that it would knock him across the room simply cutting a light wire? And why does the wife stay in the house? Is she now possessed by the serial killer? Is the baby going to be the killer reincarnated? This movie was such a frustrating experience I wanted to call my PBS station and ask for my money back!

The only Buttgereit film I would seen previously was Nekromantik and I hated every minute of it, but  shockingly  this film is worse! Der Todesking is pointless in the same way as Nekromantik, but it is a worse film because it is boring in a way that few movies have ever managed it is not far off The Blair Witch Project, seriously. Some people say that this film is sick and shocking, but it really is not. The director may have been making a point about death, but only he knows what it is. How anyone could watch this film and be anything other than bored with it is completely beyond me. The film revolves around the theme of suicide, and follows the deaths of seven different people over the course of a week. Yes, that means we have a pointless and boring episode for Monday, a pointless and boring episode for Tuesday, a pointless and boring episode for Wednesday etc etc. This film manages to be even more boring than my average week! Der Todesking is apparently an art film, although this would appear to be a reference to the way that not very much makes sense rather than a reference to the film bearing any resemblance to art. Each segment of the film is meant to tell a separate story  but it does not! We just get a quick little sketch on suicide, and it only makes you wonder what the point is. The film feels like it should be deep, but there is a great big void where the intelligence should be and nothing there to fill it. Buttgereit uses a few evocative images; but I am unlikely to remember any of them for more than a week or so because this film just is not that memorable. There is a shot involving a decomposing mans body that features fairly often, but that gets old pretty quick and all you are left with is the rest of the film, which is unfortunate. If I were to struggle for good things to say about this crap, all I can think of is this; the title sounds cool. As I mentioned, Nekromantik is the only other film I have seen from this amateur director; I have copies of Schramm and Nekromantik 2, and now I am really in no rush to watch either.

He justified the murders due to  America being a democracy and because some Americans voted the politicians in power, then all Americans in the end are responsible for the actions and decisions made by their leaders on the MiddleEast. Helloooo! Is this guy for real?? Some Americans do not even vote! Some Americans do not even know where the MiddleEast is; some do not even know what religion is practiced there; and majority do not know the real political issues that are played behind the scenes.  Mr Chahine, the reason why we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic. The innocent victims in the Twin Towers came from around the world. The murdered firefighters, rescuers, office workers, bystanders and flight passengers have nothing to do with politics. And yet, we are not allowed to go about our lives because some people think everyone has to choose a side or a religion. We are perceived as fair game for the extreme politics.3 The Israeli segment showed their own bombed victims. Another filmmaker using this event to push their own political agenda. Sometimes, it is not about you. Some people always think about the me, me, me. Sometimes, it is about other people.4 Idrissa Ouedraogos segment is a joke and another political point scorer. They obviously want money from the international community by highlighting their poverty.

This movie was made by and for people who do not feel poetry, by and for showoffs; and I dare say, by and for people who have no sense of decency or, for that matter, respect for other peoples life or death especially when the victims are thought to be mostly bloody imperialists killed in Yankee soil. I even find the original marketing idea of the eleven episodes of eleven minutes, nine seconds and one frame as particularly hideous and repulsive. Just plain awful. Why did not they assign a budget of as many dollars per episode as individuals were brutally murdered in the attack? The whole idea rests somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism. Anybody who is serious about filmmaking and serious about life and death should have angrily declined to participate in this recollection of innuendoes and nonsequiturs. With two exceptions the episode of Burkina Faso  almost amusing , and the one from India which documents the story of a man who was unfairly and wrongly investigated in relation to the attack, on the basis that afterwards he did not return home and that he was an American Muslim and, truth be told, when the facts were known he was honored as a hero. All other nine episodes, essentially and extremely boring and emotionless, can be listed in two different categoriesFirst I do not care about the thousands of victims Americans, foreigners, children, youngsters, adults, oldtimers... and can be resumed in pure boredom and lack of emotion. Makhmalbafs Iran; Lelouchs France \u0096 I am afraid I am going to commit an heresy since it is Lelouchs, but maybe, his episode might be considered built upon an idea which could be regarded as almost original; Tanovics BosniaHerzegovina; Gonzalez Inarritus Mexico; Gita\u00efs Israel; Penns USA Second The bloody Yankees deserve it. And can be resumed in frustration and hatred. Chahine Egypt vindicates the suicide bombers; Loach UK considers the 911 reckless attacks were some kind of punishment for the alleged support of the USA to the Chilean dictatorship headed by the serialkiller Augusto Pinochet, in fact someone should inform Mr. Loach that the victims of Pinochet were not related to AlQaida and that Chile is a South American country which sole existence Mr. Bin Laden should have ignored, he ought to be informed too that the American government sanctions against the Chilean dictatorship were harder than any other ciountries; and, Imamura Japan windingly points out that WWII is related the attack to the WTC. Imamura has at least been coherent in this the supposed cause effect linking is entirely nonsensical, which plays well with his episode including a man who believes himself to be a snake. It pretends to be obscure. It is, instead, quite ludicrous.There is some kind of error shared by many, including some Americans, and it consists in the belief that this movie was not commercially screened in the States because of some kind of censorship. Nothing further from the truth This movie was not screened in the States because it is a complete fiasco. A fiasco of the wackyest kind. Even in Buenos Aires, where Peronism and other forms of Fascism are nearest and dearest to the hearts of a sizable number of its inhabitants, and antiAmericanism is in vogue, the movie was screened in living rooms hurriedly converted into theaters, and was applauded by a very select public The usual sad few who routinely lend their applause to other equally quaint spectacles.

To compensate the consequent lack of suspense, we learn more and more about how unbalanced are the characters. And oh yes, they have lots to show.

Mr. Lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitchblack characters.Ethan Hawkes Hank is a 30something whining, immature, irresponsible manchild divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he is a loser, which he very much is. His indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he is too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed. By the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film, it is more pathetic than uplifting. Ethan Hawke plays his character well, but is not given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he does not particularly care that it is there.Speaking of which his characters wife is equally as bad. Just about every single shot of the film she is in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already nonexistent selfesteem with insults. Seriously, that is just about all the character does. Her harpylike behavior borders on malevolent.Albert Finney plays their father Charles, and while Mr. Finney has been a great actor for many decades, he spends about 90 of this film with the same mouth open halfgrimace on his face like he is suffering from the worlds worst bout of constipation. For someone who is been an actor as long as Mr. Finney, you think he would be more apt at emoting. Even though he does not show it much, his character is supposedly grief stricken and angerfilled. And when he smothers Andy at the films conclusion it is akin to Dr. Frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of it is own misery.Marisa Tomei is not given much to do with her character. Stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason. When Andys world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship, but it really does not make her any less selfish or selfserving than any other character in the film, but probably the one with the most common sense at least.And finally we come to Andy, played by the always good Philip Seymour Hoffman, is the only reason I rated this film a 3 instead of a 1. His performance of the heroinaddicted, embezzling financial executive who is perfect crime of robbing his parents insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing. His descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable, deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic. Hoffmans character ends up being the films chief villain, but it is hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who is selfadmitted poor early parenting led to his sons eventual psychosis and indirect, unintentional murder of his mother.Ultimately this film is really only worth watching for PSHs great performance and it is family train wreck nature.

A film centered on the racial politics that occur at modern day colleges.There are three main characters to which the film bases its foundation around for its story Malik Williams, an carefree lowbrow athlete who is an African American male. Kristin Conner, a sheltered soft white girl, and Remy, a unsophisticated unconnected white male. All three are overcome by the sudden realities that college life is not as good as it is advertised as all three go through disappointment by being unprepared Malik, by being naive Kristin, and by being unwanted Remy.One good thing about the film is that it does show that modern American colleges are just high schools writ large. The colleges are not places to build character , develop potential, or enhance personal advancement, but they are institutions used to gather all sorts of students in a onesizefitsall atmosphere. It is an experience that usually is built for failure for most students. It would have been good if the film built it story about this travesty rather than racial politics.But it did not and that is where the films falls apart. Singleton ,it seems, had a pretty bad experience at Southern California. Through this film he lets it all hang out. There is no need to beat around the bush here. Singleton lets the heroes and the villains of this piece be easily seen.The black characters in the film are pretty much seen as the heroes here while all the whites in the film are seen as the villains, save for Kristin, who was raped by a fellow white student.Who can understand the inconsistencies of this film? Black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points out to them who supposedly raped her? The ease that the black gang members have at the university while a bunch of skin heads meet in a dark small dorm planning violence? The performances of Omar Epps Malik and Kristy Swanson Kristin are disappointing. They do seem like the third choices for the roles that they played in this movie Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore were supposed to play Malik and Kristin but were unavailable. OShea Jackson aka Ice Cube ,Busta Rhymes, and Regina King were all irritating in their respective roles. And Laurence Fishburne was woefully miscast here as the history professor. Only Michael Rappaport did well in this film and he did considering that his character ,of the three main characters, changed the most in the film.John Singleton wanted to take on the matter of race and inequality in American college life with this film. And he did so quite badly. It was sort like killing a fly with a shotgun. Life is far more complex than it seems and people are alike all over and he should know this. Higher Learning is proof that he did not understand this at all. Seeing the film ,then and now, would only confuse, disappoint and enrage the same public he would wish to speak to. Not to mention it would not entertain them in the slightest.","label":0},{"index":4385,"txt":"This movie shows how racist John Singleton is.

Singleton barely touched on the relationships between the white and black characters that were trying to reach out to each other.

I agree universities are not bastions of tolerance like they are supposed to be and the title would be fitting if Singleton did not make his characters such broad caricatures.On the surface he tries to portray Ice Cubes character as a bad guy, provoking Remy to become a racist skinhead. But who graduates at the end in the movies redeeming epilogue? It seems Singleton points at white as either unable to empathize I did not say sympathize! with his fellow black student OR only able to take the path of a racist skinhead.

I know it is cheaper, but they should have shot it in California, so we could have had scenes in the desert. That would have been more true to the movie. The first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains, with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold. That doesnt feel very Egyptian. What worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient Egypt. Here it feels like they are running around fighting aliens in a Canadian forrest. And it is so lame that appaerantly, on other planets, the fall comes as well. You can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside Vancouver. It just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb. And then there is Richard Dean Anderson. He is no Kurt Russel. Sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy Russels performance a little bit, but he is just not as cool as Russel. And not nearly as good an actor as Russel. And Russells way of playing O Neill, well he was much more cynical. Andersons O Neil, is way too soft. I liked it that Russels version just didnt give a s and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie. Michael Shanks does a really good job as Jackson though taking over from James Spader.Tealc is a really annoying character. He is Jaffa. Not a Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh!! A former bodyguard of a pathetic Ra character, seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far. Tealc speaks talks and acts like a robot. I have seen better acting from Jean Claude Van Damme.And the fact that Tealc and the Ra character and the people they saved in the movie, can speak English all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb. What made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters. As for the special effects, they are really good in the pilot. But the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap. Especially a planet they visit with crystals. It is so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background. It is an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap. Especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds. The Xfiles had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993. That was 4 years before SG1 started. And they didnt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode, that SG1 supposedly had. They must have spend all the money on catering. Because I do not see it on the screen.

I get the feeling that he thinks he is pretty smart; however, this movie is almost comically transparent and self righteous. In addition, there are a bunch of mightmakesright messages like when our local Nazi jerks get beat up. I mean, who in their right mind is going to root for a bunch of Nazi jerks? However, he way Singleton portrays the fight is downright silly and seems to be designed to show us more the superior fighting qualities of the black protagonists than anything else. There is another bad guy in reality a drunken frat boy who rapes one of the movies protagonists. In this instance, I think that Singleton actually does a nice job portraying what is probably an all too common situation when the woman involved asks the frat boy to use a condom and he either does not have one or does not want to use one. In any event, he does not accede to her demands that he stop and he proceeds to have intercourse despite her pleas. I think that this type of rape is all too common and in fact many uniformed people refuse to accept the fact that it is even a rape. Well, no means no, this is a rape, which probably occurs a lot in Universities across the country.Having established the rape, how does Singleton deal with it? When the frat boy tries to call the woman, her roommate refuses to put the victim on the phone, at which point the frat boy calls the roommate a black bitch. The aggrieved roommate appears to appeal to a counsel of Ice Cube, et al, who then proceed to physically humiliate and abuse the frat boy into repeated and prolonged apologies to roommate for his racist remarks; however the apparently in Singletons mind lesser crime of rape is not mentioned. Again, no one really should feel sorry for the frat boy; however, Singleton seems to be sending a dual message that a racist comment is a greater offense then rape and in any event violence is justified against jerks.What is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but Singleton, while no doubt a talented director, does not appear to have the maturity or depth to pull of something of this magnitude.","label":0},{"index":4392,"txt":"MINOR SPOILERS!Well i just sat up late and watched this film, mainly because i enjoyed and rated some of Singletons earlier work like Boyz n the hood.

The acting is mainly poor,pop stars and models do NOT necessarily make good actors...take note, the situations hard to swallow, rape victim becomes overnight lesbian?...please!, but worst of all it reinforces every screwed up stereotype you can think of. By the second half of the film it has become cartoon like in its characterisation, making you lose any shred of empathy you may have had for its onedimensional players.Not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result it merely ends up sensationalising the results of these problems. It is message is contradictory, resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion.

I am a white male and I know many black and hispanic people who agree that this movie is wrong to portray characters and giving them those characteristics exclusively due to their race.The storyline which I will explain now revolves around three characters. One a black athlete , the other a confused scared white girl who questions her sexuality , and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared , then blames his problems on black people in which he becomes a nazi later in the film.

What sets Higher Learning apart from the pack is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most hamfisted and predictable way possible, oh yeah it is in college too.This film deals with this problem of racism the way Frankenstein deals with most problems, it bashes you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner. Most of the characters are cartoonish, onedimensional, caricatures lesbian feminist, angry black man, that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible. Instead of defying stereotypes this film is overpopulated with them. The angry black men feel cheated, feminists hate men, etc. one feminist even holds a sign that reads Dead Men Do not Rape. See what I mean? I do not want to give anything away, but in this movie if someone seems like a shifty loner or a date rapist they will probably behave exactly how you expect them to. The changes the characters go through seems obvious to everyone but the people in the movie. The big twist in the plot hinges on whether or not the violent neoNazis will act like violent neoNazis. I will guess you will just have to watch to find out what happens.Another problem I have with this movie is that it is supposed to be gritty and hardhitting, but they make Nazis the bad guys. I agree Nazis are evil, but that is my point. Everybody thinks Nazis are bad; we are not breaking any new ground here. Nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930s. The film does not challenge any viewpoints or make bold statements. It just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy, afterschoolspecial like, manner. Being antirape, antiracist, and antiNazi is not exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issue.Higher Learning is predictable, cartoonish, and in a word stupid.

This picture presents AfricanAmericans as savage, uncultured, violent, inarticulate, reefersmoking sociopaths. FudgeIce Cube and his posse of homies are continuously disrespectful toward others in the dorm, not just the white people, but Asians too, and are never disciplined for their actions. Despite all that tolerance they keep on whining and crying about the evil white oppressors who run their lives and stand in their way. In fact it is Fudges influence that causes Remmy to bond with the skin heads, to drop out of college, and eventually to kill Maliks girlfriend.The skinheads are presented as a covert group of underachievers who share a pad off campus and generally stay away from everyone else. They never blast their music to annoy people nor do they taunt the police. They do commit serious crime such as battery and rape, yet they are not as repulsive nor as threatening as Fudge and DreadsBusta Rhymes are.There is a lot of material in this film which almost offended me or made me giggle. Some of it is as follows below.Fudge and Dreads are stated as students at the Columbus University yet we never see them in class and it is completely unclear how they pay their tuition. One is only left to speculate that the weed they smoke has something to do with their finances. Though they are students at what looks like a private university, they cannot utter a single line of proper English. Their characters are developed only through their compulsive whining and xenophobia.It appears that drunken KristenKristy Swanson knew exactly why drunken Billy was taking her to his house. She even asked him to get a rubber so that they could begin. The fact that he penetrated her without a condom became a rape whilst it would be great sex only if he had one handy. Later Kristen was assured by TarynJennifer Connely that she holds no accountability in that matter, and despite willfully jumping into a guys bed she was not ready for sexual intercourse and was viciously taken advantage of by a sexual predator. Then a week or so later she met, and slept with, an ultrasensitive dogooder who knew how to avoid raping and brought a condom. The director stressed contraception thoroughly.This movie is complete and utter garbage that makes black people look like pricks and women look stupid and frail. Cole Hausers acting, and Laurence Fishburnes accent are the only reasons I can think of to watch it. The writerdirector is obviously a man of limited intelligence.

The Jewish guy, in stereotypical fashion, crumbles in fear and starts pleading for his life... but the big, strong, defiant Omar Epps stands strong with no fear. We also have the condemnation of every fraternity member as being a arrogant preppie drunk or rapist. The raped white girl, of course, begins considering lesbianism since she is just a weak white girl after all. When the nerdy white guy is rejected by the fraternity members he of course must fall in with the skinheads, who are incredible cowards; especially the big muscular guy who is beaten down quickly by the strong black men. Wait... BUSTA RHYMES BEAT UP A GUY TWICE HIS SIZE??? Yeah, right.Of course the black men NEVER reject their own people and Omar Epps moves in with them easily. The scenes where Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are just stupid  of course he is the dominating one while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually move out.

The acting was not extremely bad for a made for TV flick, but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not coherent, and ending up being confusing. How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960s? The ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized, everything had to turn out right in the end. I would advise you to not waste your time on The 60s and do something else with your time. I am glad I watched this in class, and not on my own time.

Social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spokeout about their views. Racial tensions, politics, the Vietnam War, sexual promiscuity, and drug use were all part of the daily fabric, and the daily news. This film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie, and largely succeeded.In this film, two families are followed one white, one black. During the first half of the film, the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family. Admittedly, there are more characters in this family, and the story lines are intermingled, but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century.On the whole, the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie.

No. And do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time? Not really. But if we must have one, does it have to be as shallow as The 60s? I like to think that cowriters Bill Couturie and Robert Greenfield had more in mind for this twopart miniseries than what ultimately resulted, especially given Couturies involvement in the superb HBO movie Dear America Letters Home From Vietnam which utilized little original music and no original footage, letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves. This presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production, but it does not do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time; like so many of its ilk, it is seen from the point of view of one family. But the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the 60s it is amazing that one of them does not go to the Rolling Stones gig at Altamont, making it seem less like a period drama and more like a Cliff Notes version of the decade.The makers rush through it so much that there is little or no time to give the characters any character, with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time  the childrens father is especially clich\u00e9d  and then when they are back on BLAMMO! it is something else. Garry Trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly. In fairness, Jerry OConnell, Jordana Brewster, Jeremy Sisto, Julia Stiles and Charles S. Dutton give their material the old college try, but they are wasted especially the latter two; it is undeniably good to see David Alan Grier in a rare straight role as activist Fred Hampton, and Rosanna Arquette in an uncredited cameo in part 2 is always welcome.What is not welcome is how The 60s drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect and this may well be the only time an American TV presentation about post60s America never mentions the British Invasion  no Beatles, no Rolling Stones... then again, there is only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album, right?.

It seemed extremely low budget. The characters are all forgettable one dimensional cutouts, and the many attempts at humor fall flat. It reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it, trying to be funny, but he is not. It is just sad.The movie was terrible as well. There is so much you can do with a portal through space, yet every place the ARMY people go is BORING! This shows no imagination! I actually thought the TV series Alien Nation from a few years back based on the movie Alien Nation was much better. That show actually had good story lines and decent characters. I was not crazy about Alien Nation, but compared to this overrated crap, it was great!Also, unlike the great new Battlestar Galactica series, Stargate copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely!

After this unnerving opening credits sequence The Blob introduces us, the viewer that is, to Steve Andrews Steve McQueen as Steven McQueen  his girlfriend Jane Martin Aneta Corsaut who are parked on their own somewhere  witness what looks like a meteorite falling to Earth in nearby woods. An old man Olin Howland as Olin Howlin who lives in a cabin also sees it  goes to investigate, he finds a crater  a strange football sized rock which splits open when he unwisely pokes it with a stick. Laying in the centre of the meteorite is a strange jelly like substance which sticks to the stick, if you know what I mean! It then slides up the stick  attach\u00e9s itself to the old mans hand.

The script by Kay Linaker as Kate Phillips  Theodore Simonson is an absolute bore  extremely dull not making the most of it is strongest aspects. The Blob focuses on the tiresome dramatics  conflicts between the teenagers  police, in fact the majority of The Blob is spent on Steve trying to convince the police of the blobs existence. For most of the film the blob itself almost seems inconsequential  somewhat forgotten. It only has two or three scenes for the fist hour  a bit until the less than exciting climax when the adults  teenagers have to work together to defeat the blob  have a new found appreciation of each other afterwards, yuck! Why could not the blob just eat the lot of em? No explanation is given for what the blob is or it is origins other than it came from space, how long did it take them to come up with that? The dialogue is clunky  silly as well, as are peoples actions  decision making, I love the part when a nurse named Kate Lee Paton as Lee Payton, did anyone use their real name in this thing? is confronted by the blob, she throws some acid over it  calmly proclaims Doctor, nothing will stop it!, how does she know nothing will stop it exactly? There is no blood or violence so do not worry about that, the special effects on the blob itself are not too bad considering but it barely has any screen time  moves very slowly, a bit like the film in general actually. The acting is terrible, McQueen is supposed to be a teenager when in reality he was 28 years old  it shows, he looks old enough to be his own dad! Same thing goes for most of the other teenage cast members  everyone generally speaking are wooden  unconvincing in their roles. Technically The Blob is very basic, dark static photography, dull direction  forgettable production values. The Blob is one of those films that probably sounds good on paper  is well known as being a classic but is in actual fact a huge disappointment when finally seen. This is one case when the remake The Blob 1988 is definitely better than the original. The original Blob is slow  boring  the remake is not, the original Blob contains no blood or gore  the remake does, the original Blob has incredibly poor acting  casting decisions  the remake does not  the original Blob itself gets very little screen time eating only three or four people throughout the entire film  the remake features the blob all the way through  it virtually eats an entire town.

Oh, there were a few pretty shots, and if you liked Friday Evening with its shots of the folds in heavy drapes and bedsheets, you might appreciate the aesthetics of LIntrus. Otherwise, steer clear.

A very incoherent attempt at a plot line.I do not like to toss this word around but in this case it fits very well. The director firstly presents the material in an extremely arrogant way and worse, extremely incoherently. It is incoherent in that it presents the material in a messy dislodged order, making us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come first, and arrogant in that at 2 hours long they expect us, the viewer to CARE by the end of it.I respect surrealist cinema for what it is. creating a story around a more than real world that does not tie to real life But there is nothing surreal about having a story placed in ordinary modern times, and a modern day earth setting, that is most importantly not able to engage the audience but furthermore, simply a dislodged series of events that barely tie together. The most accurate way to describe the experience of viewing this film is like viewing a story; perhaps even a very GOOD story as it was based on a book, but being frustrated by the fact that the camera does not seem to capture the necessary moments and tie together any means of coherence.Let us compare stylistic cinema. Compare Gaspar Noes Seul contre tous to this. He gave us a coherent, extremely engaging and intellectually deep story. This movie offers no intellectual study, and while it is very stylistic in it is fragmented presentation, the director has ultimately abandoned the essential art of good storytelling and all we are left with is a mess of events that barely tie in together.Yes indeed it IS possible to make sense of things.... to a POINT. But as i said earlier the viewer will reach a stage where they simply say Who cares. It plays out like watching a drab mundane story of a man going to a supermarket and buying groceries in uncronological order. Even with murders it is completely uninteresting and unengaging.

STARLIFT, you see, is set largely at Travis Air Force base in California in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being shipped out to fight in Korea. But you would need to do your own research to know this because not once during the film is the name Korea mentioned. We see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but there is no mention of where these men will be fighting or getting injured. Which is kind of weird for a film designed to wave the flag and salute Americas men in uniform. Released in December 1951 by Warner Brothers, STARLIFT is a very obvious effort to replicate the success of the studios starstudded World War Two homefront morale booster Hollywood Canteen. This 1944 crowdpleaser told the story of two soldiers spending their last three nights of leave hanging out at the famous armed forces nightclub in LA hoping to get a date with Joan Leslie. But really it was just an excuse for Warners to trot out every star under contract, from Joan Crawford, John Garfield, and Barbara Stanwyck to Peter Lorre, Bette Davis, Sydney Greenstreet and more. STARLIFT features two Air Force soldiers hoping to meet fictional starlet Nell Wayne a masklike Janice Rule and persuading a bunch of Warner Bros stars to put on a show for the departing troops. But in place of Crawford, Garfield et al the best the brothers Warner could scrape up in 1951 were Doris Day, Ruth Roman, Gordon MacRae, Virginia Mayo, Gene Nelson and Phil Harris with fleeting appearances by James Cagney, Randolph Scott, and a clearly embarrassed looking Gary Cooper. This threadbare cast, whose combined star power would struggle to illuminate a standard lamp, is perfectly matched by the crummy production values. Presumably in an effort to save money several long scenes were shot using really really bad back projection. How bad is it? You can see the join where the screen meets the floor of the soundstage!

Still, the lowrent production and justadequate technical aspects render Starlift strictly a secondbiller. 12 from ","label":0},{"index":4421,"txt":"When I was younger I really enjoyed watching bad television. We have all been guilty of it at some time or another, but my excuse for watching things like Buck Rogers in the 25th Century and Silver Spoons is this I was young and naive; ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhile.Thankfully, I now appreciate the good stuff. Stargate SG1 is not good. The 12 yearold me would love every hackneyed bit of it, every line of stilted dialogue, every bit of needless technobabble. The writing is beyond insipid; so bland and uninspired it makes one miss Star Trek Voyager. If your show makes me long for the worst Trek show ever, you are in trouble.The film Stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure, anchored by two solid performances by James Spader and Kurt Russell, full of fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, a wonderful musical score, and cool scifi ideas. With the exception of a little of the original music, none of what made the film fun appears in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver watchable and Legend interesting, seems like he is half asleep most episodes.The budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebodys basement. The cinematography is not much better, as vanilla and dull as the scripts. It amazes me that shows with a lot more style like Farscape and substance like the reimagined Battlestar Galactica have smaller, less rabid fanbases than this pap. It just does not deserve it.","label":0},{"index":4422,"txt":"Whoa boy.Ever wanted to watch a documentary about a megalomaniacal jerk ruining his own life and alienating everyone around him? Well they exist, in many forms. But have you ever wanted to watch said documentary about one who did not ultimately succeed in doing anything despite everyones praises about how much of an artistic genius he is? Well you could probably just grab a camera and find someone like that in any local scene I know they are everywhere and I do not even follow the local scene, or you could save yourself the trouble by spending money watching this tripe.The premise is good and, honestly, it is not as if the filmmakers knew precisely where it was going considering that is one of the difficulties of doing a documentary. We are made to follow two bands, The Brian Jamestown Massacre, lead by Anton, and The Dandy Warhols, lead by Courtney. I have heard of The Dandy Warhols before watching this movie... not so the Brian Jamestown Massacre. Why? Well from this documentarys perspective, because The Brian Jamestown Massacres intergroup dysfunction refused them the ability to really make it in the music industry. However, instead of this becoming an analysis of the two separate bands and how one was able to succeed, the focus becomes much more on Anton and his insanity.Because, see, Anton is a genius. Because he plays rock music. He really understands the evolution of music... because he plays rock music with a lot of different instruments. His music is considered postmodern retro but the future... because it is rock music. He wants to bring out a revolution... through rock music. Okay so let us face it... twenty minutes in and this is one of the stupidest kids I would care to watch a documentary about.The documentary itself does not really lend itself to showcasing any of Antons talent, because in the nature of editing down 2000 hours of material into a quarter short of two hours we do not really have the time to focus on that. So instead we watch Anton, the genius, the sociomaniacal loser, be a jerk for the two hours and are just told to understand that he made really great music. Whether he did or not I will not know, because its not like the documentary had enough time to prove it. What I do know is that then we are left with a story about some selfcentered obnoxious twerp running around the country calling himself a God of music and doing nothing to back it up. Why even bother watching that? People like Anton do not deserve the attention they seek, the hope and admiration of all those different people, and especially a postfailure paean to lost potential. This movie plays like a twohour roughcut VH1 special for a reason he goes on and on about the music, but it is all about the image and the attention. Look at the guy, look at how he dresses, look at how he acts, look at how he tries to create controversy because he cannot afford marketing.Honestly the only interesting character in this film is Joel, and that is because of anyone in this documentary, Joel is the only person who seems to have any fun. Maybe it is because he is the tambourine man. The rest of them are all rock stars! They deserve our attention, and admiration, and interest, and engagements! They are out there to save rock and roll. Do you remember when The White Stripes were supposed to save rock and roll? Yeah, that was because of Anton, and it is selfish of them not to mention me Anton as an inspiration. What a load. People like Anton are best left forgotten. This documentary explains why mainstream music is so dullbecause music execs have to deal with people like Anton for a living and ultimately can only really throw their support behind someone safe and passionless. Thanks a lot, Anton. Your antics ruined music for EVERYONE you touched, whatever the opinion to the contrary is. And if people in the know about Anton disagree and he really was a genius, it still shows how bad this documentary is that it cuts it down that way.PolarisDiB","label":0},{"index":4423,"txt":"Truly bad and easily the worst episode I have ever seen....ever.They tried to make up for it by giving it the, we know we are doing this routine. That would have been funny if it were not for the fact that The Simpsons had already done it. And it still would not make up for it if they had come up with the idea in the first place.The flashbacks took place as part of the usual characters mainly J.Ds fantasies. The flashbacks were not even of actual events that occurred, just compilations of say, J.D falling over or, i do not know.... Elliott falling over. If I wanted to watch a Scrubs compilation i would go on youtube and not waste half an hour of my life.Scrubs has ultimately fallen into the trap that most sitcoms have to, and it disappoints me, they managed to go 5 and a quarter seasons without an episode like this.

One season later, they succumbed to that which almost all sitcoms inevitably do, the clip show...and it looked like it was put together by the workexperience kid. Dr Coxs shaved head shows just how lazy the editors were in putting it together, as it does not appear again until My Long Goodbye some 4 episodes later. I cannot imagine that a wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a wellconstructed sitcom.

It did not work.For starters, showing all the times that people have fallen down is not funny when taken out of context. It is not funny to see Todd dangling by his banana hammock unless we know WHY he was dangling by his banana hammock.Second, for what was supposed to be a compilation of JDs fantasies, one was Turks dream, another also was not his fantasy, although I forget which.And that is the problem. This episode is totally forgettable. We have seen all these things before. And the collection of clips of people dancing? Why? That is not funny.Finally, I must admit two of my favourite Scrubs moments were shown in the last compilation...Dr. Cox realising that Ben died...and JD telling him how proud of him he is.But even seeing those moments again did not save the episode.

This movie is no Cabarnet and certainly no Casablanca. I agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sitcoms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy. But let us look at the obsolete theme of the movie.With the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom. Since Watch on the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman has been exposed as a Bidenesque plagiarist with her so called reallife story Julia from her book Pentimento. As one of the most odious of a plethora of Westernbased USSR apologists, it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir America to action to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism from the fascists, who had just proved their military superiority in Spain.As one reviewer correctly noted, this is not a proAmerican play and movie, as Lillian went to her grave an Americanloathing communist.

This is by far the worst movie ever made. I truly, from the bottom of my heart, want to sue Aaron Yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life.So apparently, it is supposed to be bad on purpose; However, if you should end up in Hell and are forced to watch this 90minute coil of doodoo, you will see that Yamasato is really trying hard to make an awesome flick. The actors attempt dramatic kickass performances comparable to Crimson Tide but come closer to The Marine.The crap acting is just the tip of the iceberg. The camera angles are awful. The story is Cmovie at best the plot is not even good enough to be considered Bmovie caliber. The dialogue attempts to be dynamic and witty, but is crap like everything else. Rumor has it that a hard copy of the screenplay actually attracts flies. Plus, the techno score is annoying... not because it is techno, but because it is NONSTOP. That is right, the music plays in the background THE WHOLE TIME, acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is. I do not care what the disclaimer claims, I do not buy it. BOTS was not made this bad on purpose, because it takes itself WAY too serious for what it was a joke.This film was very lowbudget. But that is no excuse for its recordsetting suck factor. Great films are born of substance, not budget. BOTS had neither.Allow me to further articulate the overwhelming power of this 90minute waste of time if I were having a threeway with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel in front of a TV and Blood of the Samurai came on, I would be out of there quicker than Steven Seagal in Executive Decision.Undoubtedly, some people will try to defend the movie. Two, maybe three. They will say, it is grindhouse chopsocky! or cheesy in a good way! or it is so bad, it is good! Those people are idiots. A movie is either good, or it is bad. There is no such thing as a good bad movie. But there ARE such things as idiots that like crappy movies. Do not get me wrong; there are lots of cornball nottobetakenseriously movies out there that are enjoyable and entertaining. Slither is one.

Her skills in body language pretty much come down to darting her eyes left and right and looking like she do not know jack. She is an emotionless husk who I am guessing has had too much botox. Her lack of facial expression through out the film is outmatched however by the deplorable love affair with the lead actor which seems to spring out of nowhere and has them making out on a beach and falling in love within a couple of hours of meeting one another. The lead actor, whose hair demands more attention than he did, was mediocre at best and did not once make me feel like he was genuinely in peril.The only thing that tops the hideous acting is the directing, storyline and inaccuracies in plot.

I hope there are more and better Korean legends they can use, because they have just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one.In short, I agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how Koreans felt about having their folk anthem Arirang being played at the very end. As a creature feature, I would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it, but I have seen many video games with better camera work and scripting just less dragons.","label":0},{"index":4451,"txt":"I am a guy, who loves guy movies...

The scene transitions were the worst I have ever seen. Why would you walk out to a beach to relax if your life was in danger? The serpent dragons actions itself was very poorly written... and the serpent dragons attack capabilities varied widely throughout the movie, several times the main characters should have died.The director attempted to infuse a love story in the middle of the movie during the most stressful times, this movie was obviously not watched after it was made, I love movies, but had to force myself to finish watching it, thank god I did not buy this, I borrowed it from a friend.Do not buy this, do not rent it, just watch discovery channel... much more exciting.","label":0},{"index":4452,"txt":"I am giving this movie a 1 because there are no negative numbers in IMDb rating system. this movie was horrible.

I will not even write any plot spoilers because the movie just is not good enough for plot spoilers. To write comments on the plot would be pointless. If I were to compare this movie, I would have to compare it to Reign of Fire, however although I did not like Reign of Fire either, that movie at least was better than this one. Some of the people in the theater left before the movie was even halfway done. The only reason I did not was because I simply did not think to do it. I was hoping for a feast of CGI and fighting masterfully done, but that is not what happened. The martial arts lasted all of 30 seconds and that was from an exercise routine done during the flashback scene, very disappointing. The CGI was not done well either. One scene comes to mind. During one of the earlier tank battles, the troops are firing away at......nothing. Someone forgot to cue the animation guys on that bit of film so the street was totally devoid of bad guys. I am also thinking the bad guys voice was dubbed by the voiceover of Imotep from The Mummy movies. Had that same scraggly echoing thing going on. Someone owed some royalties, here?

But it is presented in such an immature, overobvious, sledgehammer way, it fails abysmally as a work of art.The only good performances here are from Paul Lukas, who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic antifascist; and Lucile Watson as the amusingly illmannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become. Though their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of hardships, the children are ridiculously shown as robotically wellbehaved little snips. They do not even remotely resemble real human beings. And Bette Davis, a great actress, here is so one dimensionally noble I cringed every time she was on screen. Her every word, her every gesture is meant to convey how SUPPORTIVE and UNDERSTANDING she is of the SACRIFICES her husband has to make and the great CAUSE he is fighting for, that she must have been wired to receive a painful electric shock if she dared allowed any hint of doubt or shading to surface in her portrayal.So yes, this is a very IMPORTANT film, just not a very good one.","label":0},{"index":4455,"txt":"I knew it was not gunna work out between me and Dwars from the moment we met. First its title was lazy. D war. Like writing out Dragon was too much for them. Also... you really cannot be that blatant with your title unless your Blue Monkey. Blue Monkey can do whatever the hell it wants. The second sign of a rocky relationship between us was the storys insane progression. Heres the film, dreamy reporter guy reports on big snake tracks, flashes back to a time he and dad wandered into what must have been the competition for the store in gremlins and dreamy kid reporter finds a box that glows. Old shop keep reveals several terrible truths. That Bauraki a supposedly evil snake was cheated out of his chance to be a god. tells the kid that he is a reincarnated warrior and that somewhere in LA is his reincarnated lover and gives him a junk piece of jewelry. Shop keep also reveals that despite his obvious whiteness he is a 500 year old Asian. fifteen years later dreamy reporter remembers this perfectly and starts acting half crazy trying to find this random girl. cgi hijinks follow and in the last ten minutes my brain melts out of my nose. Why? Continue on dear reader if you have the Balls.so Sarah, the reincarnated lover, has her own flashbacks. I have the benefit of having an Asian best friend and in the scene where she starts to freak out and make a bunch of posters with Asian characters on them he tells me that whoever made this movie has no idea what their doing. Its a Korean legend and she is reincarnated from a Korean princess but everything is in Chinese. Later that night her dragon tat starts to hurt, she calls the police cause it looks like she is having a heart attack. See, in this mixed up crazy world they apparently handle heart attacks differently because the next time we see her she is locked in her room with a guard outside and a nurse claims she is crazy. I have a new phobia now, and its that if i am ever in trouble the first responders will just assume i am crazy. I have another point of contention with my harsh mistress, Dwar. There is a scene when Patrick Dempsey Jr Dreamy Reporter is in a caf\u00e9 with sassy black friend. In the scenes prior Miffed Near divinity Bauraki has killed an elephant, slithered through a suburb and killed one of Sarahs friends. See, people were afraid to come out after 911 happened but we must have all toughened up after that deciding coffee and pastries were worth risking our lives for. Business as usual, no way a giant snake will stop me from getting my caffeine on. If i stay inside and fear for my life the terrorists and serpentine divinities win. After being given a satisfying dragon on Helicopter battle my cruel lover Dwar treats me to a pi and vinegar filled scene to end it all with. Bauraki has a fortress of his own and its right under LA i guess. They do not really say but Dreamy Reporter and Sarah get knocked out in a car crash that would kill lesser men and when they wake up, yep dragon palace. some retarded dialog later a good dragon snake god pops out of nowhere and the snakes wrestlemake love whatever. And i am not kidding good snake out of nowhere. Maybe you think i am blowing it out of proportion, i am not there is no mention of this thing in the movie then suddenly... there! Few seconds later and good dragon becomes dragon god, sets Baurki on fire, Sarah turns into a ghost and goes with Dragongod, dreamy reporter left in the middle of nowhere roll credits... thank godNow our relationship as rocky as it was had its good times. There was a guy that look like shredder from turtles and talked exactly like a tuskan raider from star wars. I will call him Tuskan Shredder. He could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted to it just could never be useful. He could walk through a wall in a scene where that was not helpful. He could go in your dreams when that would not do any good and he could light ten random soldier guys on fire but not when it mattered. He was also allergic to touching that junk jewelry. I like him cause he was hit by a car twice in the same scene and made fantastic tuskan raider noises. The actors for the most part were great... if great somehow meant terrible. Jason Behr, whom i thought was awesome in Roswell i slowly find out can only act one way and that is pretentious, spacey and Patrick Dempseyish.The one thing i love about this filthy prostitute Dwars is its lead actor, Bauraki. That Giant snake acted his heart out. I would dare to say that he was better at playing a cgi serpentine demigod of evil then John Barrymore was at playing Richard the III or Hamlet. There was emotion in every scene, stealing the thunder from his lesser mortal supporting cast. When he ate an elephant i felt like no one past, present or future would ever eat an elephant with as much feeling. He was more then an actor, he was a force of nature and he put his heart and soul into every second of this cursed project. Yes damn it, my favorite actor in this film was a cgi snake. I have got the balls to admit that, do you?Heres to hoping Bauraki gets more work and is not type cast, that Jason Behr finds a range of emotion other then dreamy stare, and that i never have to watch Blue Monkey again.

But with my willing suspension of disbelief intact, and a naive faith stemming from the cool looking poster in the lobby, I really wanted this film to work. Sadly, by the time the old man in the pawnshop explained the entire backstory, fifteen minutes into the picture, I had the sudden, sinking revelation that comes from knowing every plot point of a still unseen film. And worse I knew just how badly every point would all suck.Let me be perfectly clear here, the English language lacks sufficient nuance and depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe just how bad this film really is.As for knowing all the twists of movie, I was wrong. In the spirit of the old Godzilla films, whose scales this one is not worthy to fill, it conveniently sprouted extra subplots every time the main characters were threatened by the specter of meaningful dialogue.It was infested with close calls, miraculous escapes, and concentrated deposits of poorly explained angst.This film is what would happen if you gave the produces of the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers access to the national defense budget. And lots of liquor.Let me try to explain.Imagine you could get a hold of all the coolestlooking set pieces from successful action movies of the last decade First take the rastatalking army of amphibians from Star Wars Episode One and remove their Prozac until they are ready to club Navy Seals.Next, take close approximations of Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise You can even call him Ethan as a subtle nod to the Mission Impossible franchise. and give them lots of film noir narration, so no one get confused while trying to follow the wadingpool depths of their thoughts.Finally add a raspyvoiced villain in pointy armor worthy of a Lord of the Rings yardsale and a couple of giant cobras, angry at having their scenes deleted from latest edition of King Kong, and lay them all out in no particular order in modern day Los Angeles.Now run to the drugstore to find something for your sudden migraine. When you return, puree these ingredients until any overlooked hint of originality is dissolved into a homogenized mass of cheese and serve semigelatinous.At several points during this picture, I found myself saying out loud, Make the bad movie stop, and breaking into tears.To call this a Bmovie would be giving it an undeserved promotion. After summer school, and a lot of physical therapy, it might possibly pass for a C level film if you could somehow sleep through most of it.In short, if you ever find yourself with money and brain cells to burn, and the need to punish yourself for hideous, unspoken sins against humanity, Dragon Wars might just be the film for you.","label":0},{"index":4457,"txt":"...there is no one else watching the movie. My husband and I went to watch it last night. It is just a small theater, but there is usually a decent amount of people there. Not this time! My husband and I were the ONLY people watching Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why.The movie was by far one of the worst I have ever seen. Yes, the CG was good, but that was it. The acting, script  dialog, directing, editing, etc. was Godawful! Since we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the movie. That is, we talked about how bad it was, that it reminded us of The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal Combat AND The Lord of the Rings. It was like we expected to see Rita and Lord Zed portraying commanders of Saurons army.The creatures were ridiculous. You cannot just introduce legions of dinodragonlizard things loaded down with cannons without explanation. The Lord of the Rings has a wide spectrum of characters, but it introduces and develops them over 3 movies, not in an hour and a half.The scene transitions are horrible. I did not fall asleep during the movie, but even though it was an overly simple plot, I found myself getting lost in the plot holes.The characters were caucasian Americans, but spoke almost with broken English because of the badly written dialog in the script.The final scene that could have redeemed some value of the movie...failed. Ethan did not cry when Sarah died...though he had not known her for very long during THIS life anyways. He did not seem too upset to be left in Mordor, not knowing where he was or how to get back. We could not for the love of God figure out where he was or how he got there either, but if he was not upset we should not be either.Oh, and why did the dress that Sarahs spirit was wearing look like she borrowed it from Queen Elizabeth? One more thing...all 3 of the main hero characters were reincarnations brought back to finish the job. Sarah completes her task and moves on to the afterlife. Jack does this as well. Then why does Ethan get screwed? He is left alone, without the girl, without a mapcompasshelicopter to help him get back. What is he supposed to do? Send smoke signals? And IF he gets back home, does he just go back to his job? He should have been given the same mercy of getting killed out of the movie that the other heroes had.Do not waste your time or money on this movie.

The movie failed to meet them.I do not mind stories that stretch credulity  remember Reign of Fire?  but I do expect them to be internally consistent.

A special agent from the FBI who seems to be completely boned up on ancient Korean folklore because of the Feds excellent paranormal division  which has gone unremarked up to this point. Lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims I never meant for this to happen. A reincarnated pair of long dead Koreans who died like starcrossed lovers. Mystic pendants, faceless hordes of robotic soldiers that owe a lot to Peter Jacksons orcs and a serpent who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along to distract it.The dialogue is appalling, the acting wooden and the effect of the whole was, to be honest, tedious. However, for me the crowning moment was at the end, after the finale, when the music for the closing credits was  Arirang! This is rather like Akira Kurosawa closing Ran with a karaoke rendition of My Way  and let me be clear that I am in no way comparing director Shim to Kurosawa.In short, a self indulgent, lackluster collection of clich\u00e9s and narrative nonsequituurs which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in Koran popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer  or even a not soserious movie goer.

The heros hair probably should have gotten its own credit, it was so oddly attention grabbing...not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic.

To be honest, the creature effects were the ONLY reason I gave this movie a 2 rather than a 1. Now, the bad things The acting. Good Lord, I have seen bad acting, but this movie takes the cake. Not a single one of the characters is even close to believable. It is like the director sent out a casting call and picked all the worst tryouts from it. I tried very hard not to giggle too loud, cause I did not wanna upset anyone else in the theatre, but the acting really was THAT BAD. The storyline The entire story is full of plot holes from beginning to finish. You can pick at least 5 plot holes out of any given 30 minutes of film. The plot holes, of course, are complimentary with the cheese. This is probably one of the most clich\u00e9d, not thoughtout, and outright dumbest stories I have ever seen put on screen since I had the grave misfortune of sitting up one night and watching Parasite on the SciFi channel. The dialogue This is a world where everyone says the cheesiest and most clich\u00e9d thing they possibly can, at every chance they possibly can. In this world, it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least 30 other lowbudget creature movies. It is the world of cheese and clich\u00e9. The special effects. While the creature effects were downright awesome, the special effects fail miserably. Yes, they are better than those seen in other movies, but a lot of it is in the presentation. And this movie has no presentation whatsoever. It looks kinda like the special effects used on the Power Rangers TV show, to be honest. To sum up Dragon Wars is worth neither your time nor your money. The concept is good, but it is trapped in the bad directing, acting, dialogue, and cheesiness of the film.

His directing style had changed or evolved to the point that this film does not contain his signature overhead shots or huge production numbers with thousands of extras. By the last few years of the Thirties, swingstyle big bands were recording the years biggest popular hits. The Swing Era, also called the Big Band Era, has been dated variously from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949. Although it is impossible to exactly pinpoint the moment that the Swing Era began, Benny Goodmans engagement at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles in the late summer of 1935 was certainly one of the early indications that swing was entering the consciousness of mainstream Americas youth. When Goodman featured his swing repertoire rather than the societystyle dance music that his band had been playing, the youth in the audience went wild. That was the beginning, but, since radio, live concerts and word of mouth were the primary methods available to spread the phenomena, it took some time before swing made enough inroads to produce big hits that showed up on the pop charts. In Hollywood Hotel, the appearance of Benny Goodman and His Orchestra and Raymond Paige and His Orchestra in the film indicates that the film industry was ready to capitalize on the shift in musical taste the film was in production only a year and a half or so after Goodmans Palomar Ballroom engagement. There are a few interesting musical moments here and there in Hollywood Hotel, but except for Benny Goodman and His Orchestras Sing, Sing, Sing, there is not a lot to commend. Otherwise, the most interesting musical sequences are the opening Hooray for Hollywood parade and Let That Be a Lesson to You production number at the drivein restaurant.

The only way to do this movie right was somehow make changes where it stands as some kind of a legend instead of just a story.

Upon hearing the title of the movie people would say, Oh, I must see it. Now where is the appeal in Kingmaker? Why not just redo the title and call it, How NOT to be a King? and make a black comedy of the old Siamese days, to the style of Dr. Strangelove. That would have been much more interesting. Narrativelike experiences of the foibles of the King from first persons goofs off would have made the movie extremely funny. Most movies today have that must see appeal, such as Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If they do not have familiar characters, some other movies such as, The Island, had an appeal itself when the advertising asks Do you still believe there is an Island?.

I would say that in order to truly understand how bad the acting is, you would have to see the movie... but that would be akin to torture.I cringe as the leading lady delivers her lines, and the rest of the cast with their accents fake or contrived is equally heinous. Another actress with the fake British accent was pretty, yes, but good lord was her accent terrible. Mix that with her lack of acting and you have a disaster. She should just have said nothing and I could have accepted her as the pretty girl. Oh my, we just got to the scene where the leading ladys lover says Really me? after a forced crying scene from her. Laughable. No, really, I just laughed out loud.The sets and the art directors offer some saving grace to the film. Some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are rather nice minus the actors.The old magic potion lady? What?! Another member mentioned the modern love song that was in the movie. Totally inappropriate for a period piece set some 500 years ago.I understand the movie was considered Big Budget in Thailand at the time of it is production. I would be seriously upset if I were the producer of this movie.

I wished he would have died in battle or one of the swordknife scuffles.Then, the tinder for the plot to kill the king was because the king did not have dinner and sex with his Queen? Pretty lame. And to go to the extreme to kill her own son? And to then push up her lover as succeeding King? I see a thread or two here and there of historical bytes, but the manner in which this was all presented was farcical.I do not recognize Gary Stretch from anything else, but he was dreadful. I read another users comments about audio being dubbed, but do not think his was dubbed ... after all, he speaks English, right? It really was awful. The lines were read right off the coroners table ... flatline. It could be he just does not have the voice to carry tone fluctuations.Aside from this, I did watch it to the end, so the movie had at least an interest.

They settle in Washington with the wifes wealthy mother and brother, though a boarder residing in the manor is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends an awful lot of time down at the German Embassy playing poker.

Lukas has several speeches in the thirdact which undoubtedly won him the Academy Award, yet for the much of the picture he seems to do little but enter and exit, enter and exit. As his spouse, Bette Davis enunciates like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage, but the role does not allow her much color. Their children all with divergent accents! are alternately humorous and annoying, and Geraldine Fitzgerald has a nothing role as a putupon wife and the disgruntled texture she brings to the part seems entirely wrong. The intent here was to tastefully, tactfully show us just because a WWIIera man may be German, that does not make him a Nazi sympathizer.

The film directed by Lek Kitaparaporn after a screenplay by Sean Casey based on historical fact in 1547 Siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest, pedestrian scripts and story development on film.The event the picture relates is the arrival of the Portuguese soldier of fortune Fernando de Gamma Gary Stretch whose vengeance for this fathers murderer drives him to shipwrecked, captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in Ayutthaya in the kingdom of Siam where he is purchased by the beautiful Maria Cindy Burbridge with the consent of her father Phillipe John RhysDavies, a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses. There is a plot to overthrown the King and Fernando and his new Siamese sidekick Tong Dom Hetrakul, after some gratuitous CGI enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness, are first rewarded by the King to become his bodyguards, only to be imprisoned together once Queen Sudachan Yoe Hassadeevichit reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover Lord Chakkraphat Oliver Pupart to take over the rule of Siam.

Who can we blame for this rubbish? The acting, dialog, and most of the sets were quite bad. Some of the fight scenes looked like they were choreographed by the local high school drama club. The special effects were also mostly bad, but a few were just cheap animation patched onto the screen that provided an especially cheesy effect.

Which is a very wrong way of looking at immigration, and a much worse way of telling people about it. That is the main thing.

I note the many elogious reviews in advance of me, and as I generally like Maria de Medeiros, I have been long hesitant to make a disparaging comment  and in such fashion nearly a year has passed. But each time I see that DVD on my shelf, I sense an inner groan. Anyway, let the elogious voices override me! But for other cinephiles like me  beware.Expressed in simplest and gentlest terms, heres my stanceThe political turmoil and overthrow providing the backdrop for this film also served as a backdrop for a certain period of my life  via newspapers I read daily in my local middleEuropean pub. At that time, I followed the newsreports, but never fully grasped what the heck was transpiring. The reporters tended to report either in nonpartisan terms, or with a conservatism which frowned upon any groups disturbing the peace or fomenting rebellion against the establishment. Those were times when other winds of unrest swirled through Paris, Berlin, Prague, and various places in the U.S., all of whose issues I understand clearly at the time  but dictatorship or not, my papers tended to treat the govermentment of Portugal simply as the establishment  not as a wellfleshed out evil empire, to use flippant Star War terms.So, week after week, I read of disturbances, but never found an intelligent editorial that might provide the history behind them, or evaluate the practices and socialeconomic impacts of the dictatorship, etc.So, in purchasing this film, I had at least two hopes to finally understand the details leading up to the social unrest, and to enjoy a wellconceived drama. This film gave me neither.The film presupposes that viewers already have ample knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical facts. And the drama  well, as I said, I want to encourage Maria de Medeiros and the Portugues film industry, but  it was trite and shallow.I obtained my copy of the DVD from France  Selection Official Cannes 2000  Un Certain Regard. The box shows smiling cleanshaven actors, the lead giving the victory sign in a fashion that reminds me more of the Playboy bunny. After seeing the work, I wondered what the French could have thought of it  though as a shallow piece of cinema verite with sensitive ethnic content, I can understand their natural inclination to praise it for its honesty but...Look at the back of the box Un regard chaleuruex sur la Revolution  a warm regard?

I was no big fan of Prince but I did like the three big songs from this moviePurple Rain, Let us Get Crazy, and When Doves Cry. The concert scenes in this movie are greatfull of energy and excitement. Unfortunately that is a VERY small portion of the movie.The story is screamingly obvious and have been done many times beforeand much better too. The subplots are, to put in nicely, badly handled. The love triangle between The Kid, Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I actually became insulted. His wife beating father is needed for the story, but the scenes are so badly handled in acting and direction that I could not believe it. The script is terriblelousy dialogue and some truly painful comedy routines. And there is tons of misogyny hereThe Kids mother getting beaten; The Kid hitting Appolonia and for no reason Appolonia strips and goes topless to swim in a dirty river. Also Williams and Princes characters treat women in a horrible manner constantly.The acting is where this movie REALLY fails. Appolonia is sweet and beautifulbut no actor. And Prince is easily the WORST actor I have ever seen. His blank face and wooden dialogue delivery are so bad I could not believe it. This movie only comes to life during the concert scenes but there are not really that many. The dramatic scenes are so badly acted and handled that they make this movie a chore to sit through.

Even the score is mesmerising, and if this was shot purely as a concert film it would be a great experience unfortunately it is not and as such the movie has some problems.First of all is the horrendous actingwriting, Princes character The Kid is supposed to come off as some type of mysterious loner of few words unfortunately this just comes off as corny and incensere. A good loner character should at least have some talkative moments, unfortunately Princes character rarely has over a few words of dialog in the film and it is hard to believe that he would get the girl this way. Everything just seems a little off here, which is a shame because you can tell this is a character that is terribly conflicted and lives a very complicated live, but we are not ever allowed to get inside of it.A surprising aspect of this film is just how much of this takes place in concert. Prince and Morriss lives seemingly take a back seat to the performances here, which I guess makes sense from a business perspective, but it is exhausting to have a 2 hour movie where seemingly half of it takes place on stage, especially when the characters back stories get pushed aside for it.So to sum it up This is not a very good movie.","label":0},{"index":4486,"txt":"Savage Island 2003 is a lame movie.

After watching the preview with my girlfriend, she decided not to watch it from how bad the preview watched. I, on the other hand, thought it looked weird enough to warrant a watching. I mean, the design of Dr. Meso alone warranted at least a brief sweep over this title. After watching it, I can say that while there are some interesting aspects to it namely the browsing over the notebooks and trying to figure out the incomprehensible story, it is best to pass over this one.Major Spoilers Ahead After making their first video for their asyetunfinished CD, the lead singer, Cassidy, kills herself in an attempt to get her boyfriend Neil to notice her. 3 months later, the band is trying to decide if they are going to finish the album or not. To try and see what Cassidy would have wanted, they go to see an old psychic friend of hers, Dr. Meso, and try to contact her through him. In his card reading, Dr. Meso turns up four straight Death cards for the four remaining band members. Bad times are ahead. I just wanted to make a point that later in the film, they do explain that the Death card really just represents change. Kudos to them on that at least. Even without the approval of their deceased friend, they decide to go ahead and finish the album. But while in the bathroom, Cassidys bestfriend, Dora, catches a glimpse of her deceased friend. When another bandmate goes in to check on her, Dora is standing in the dark, requesting his sunglasses. That is when the killing begins.My main problem with the film from the very getgo is that it seems to be heavy stylized to a fault. Too many warping effects, unnecessary zooms, and a plethora of other cheap effects riddle this film. An incoherent storyline does not help anything either. While the narrative hangs together for the first part, once Cassidy is resurrected, everything falls apart. We have jumpcuts between Cassidy and Dr. Meso who mysteriously was able to get into a locked building, which show they are connected in some way or another. However, within a few minutes of that revelation, we find that Cassidy really is an independent being from Meso. She then turns on the guy who had been helping her revenge and he scurries away in a way that calls to mind Jack Nicholson as The Joker. But not in a good way.From this point on, the whereabouts of Cassidy are shown, but there are strange lapses as character moves from place to place almost out of sequence. One scene we see Cassidy standing at a desk, when a character enters in the next, she is nowhere to be found. As he moves behind the desk, we see her at the end of a hallway. Then in another room grabbing the keys which Neil already has, then back again. Not to mention that from one moment to the next, Cassidys mood seems to go a complete 180 without a catalyst to it. One moment, she wants to kill everyone although she is only wounded 90 of the characters  the next she is apologizing to everyone and walks out the door to die again. Sound confusing? That is because it is. It is a jumbled mess that I am sure the writer could not even figure out.As for the performances, most are particularly wooden. Some though are interesting, but overall this is not a piece that would be known for it is acting. The story is the driving force behind this piece.","label":0},{"index":4490,"txt":"STUDIO 666 aka THE POSSESSED in the UK is another subpar slasher that has the appearance of a straighttoDVD movie.Whilst many of the straighttoDVD movies are fastpaced or unintentionally hilarious in the sobadit isgood sense, STUDIO 666 is a lamentable failure.At the time of writing, every comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review.

The movie only has a slight twist and one that is badly handled to the usual expectations. A depressed singer commits suicide. Soon after, her spirit returns to possess one of her surviving friends. The said possessed friend goes on a killing spree. The rest of the plot really is too bizarre to sum up. You will just have to see it for yourself, providing your interest has not yet waned to the point of extinction of course.The acting in the movie is very poor for the most part. The actress who played Dora was an exception to this. Her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen. She helps to elevate the movie above similar contemporary efforts. Unfortunately, some of the lines she was given to say were badly written to put it mildly and thus prevent her from saving the movie.The direction was equally poor. The villains did not seem the least bit menacing, every killing was totally devoid of suspense or tension, atmosphere was nonexistent and the camerawork was incredibly basic. Some of the special effects if you can call them that reminded me of the TV series, GHOST STORIES.

My roommate and I watched Midnight Skater, and when it was complete, I do not think either of us believed that any of the movie had just happened.

Despite being part action, part romantic comedy, this movie fails to offer the viewer much of anything of interest for at least the first fortyfive minutes in which the filmmakers take more than enough time to show the immediate problem i.e. Bernie being in possession of a car and a dead body, and a hitman finding out that the Porsche is going to be hard to find. After which, and thanks to poor acting by Haim I loved this kid, too, but it is not exactly sacrilegious to admit the times when he obviously could not act well and the lack of real immediacy and emergency between Bernie and the villain that makes much of the events unconvincing and as a result, inappreciable. To add injury to insult, the soundtrack was unbelievably laughable and sounded more like selfevident songs you would hear in Team America see the date montage.Loyal Corey Haim fans, however, should not be disappointed to see their boy in abundance. However, others understanding that Haims career probably peaked when he was 14 or 15 and never recovered, might expect mediocrity, as will viewers just looking for early 90s bcomedy fluff to pass the time.","label":0},{"index":4529,"txt":"The story at the outset is interesting slavery in the late 20th century from west Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem with it is that it intentionally castigates two of director Richard Fleishers favorite enemies Arabs and Germans. To make us believe that very Arablooking men would be free to roam around and easily catch Blacks in West Africa is as believable as Whites hunting for slaves in Roots. Obviously both trades arewere run by locals and involved much more sophisticated networks. While Arab countries are complicit in todays child and sex slave trade, Israel is one of the worst violators according to Amnesty International. So why only point out Arabs and then choose a German as the only European buyer?

And the fact that I cannot recollect the title to a single one of them offhand is a measure of their impact. These are what novelists would call potboilers. They are scarcely more than a vehicle for keeping moviestars in the public eye.We have Micheal Caine, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden; more than enough names to get bums on cinema seats. Every taste in hero is catered for. Though one suspects that most of the audience still went away disappointed.Their talents are simply thrown away, and I wonder that stars with so much money and such reputation can be yet so desperate or lacking in good sense. This sort of movie hardly adds gilding to a CV. Sometimes maybe actors should choose their director instead of the other way round.It was pretty obvious that it would be crap even from the outset. That ludicrously mismatched jauntyjazz theme music, which also percolated up every time some incidental noise is needed, had all the atmospheric conviction of elevator Muzak. Who imagined employing a jazz band when a scene depicted the steamy jungles of central Africa, or the endless Sahara with camels and palms as a backdrop? Definitely a serious goofball. Ennio Morricone would have known what to do; and his results would have oozed enough atmosphere and tension to raise my rating a good two points. This director should have taken the trouble to watch Lawrence of Arabia, or even Sergio Leones westerns; he might have learnt a few things. But then again, probably he would not.Alfred Hitchcock played the disappearing wife theme to good effect in his film Frantic. It was later remade with equal panache staring Harrison Ford. In each case the confusion surrounding her loss and the tension of the chase was tangible. Here, when Michael Caine might be otherwise compelled to employ a little brain and bravado, Rex Harrison kept poppingup out of nowhere like some wily old genii, to put him back on track whenever the narrative stumbled. At least the photography was rather good, with excellent use of the often beautiful environment. But then the dumb music must pipeup and blow to atoms what little ambiance this created.Action scenes were also contrived and stilted, with such ineptly choreographed fight sequences that they might have been staged in a firstyear drama class. And, of course, the players must fight to a jazz accompaniment  as you do.And that is about as much comment as this item deserves.

Along comes Peter Ustinov who can barely summon enough ham in him to make a go of the part as a Moslem slave dealer. As Johnson is black he grabs her anyway along with a lot of children and a few adults as well.Of course Caine does not take kindly to the kidnapping and the rest of the film is spent in a rescue attempt. The rest of the cast has such folks as William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and Indian film star Kebir Bedi in parts and looking so incredibly bored with the whole thing.Usually in something like this talented people like those mentioned above will just overact outrageously and feast on a diet of scenery.

William Holden is better, but his screen time is fleeting and, again, his character is not well scripted.Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen, but is given very little to do, the film might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the films serious tone.

Perhaps Caine remembers only too begrudgingly the physically punishing demands of filming an action film in searing 130 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures the director, Richard Fleischer, was hospitalised as a result of sunstroke during the shoot. What Ashanti actually emerges as is not the career lowpoint of Michael Caine. Instead, it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast, exotic locations, boring stretches and a highly formulaic storyline.Dr. David Linderby Caine is a W.H.O medic who is left devastated when his black wife Anansa Beverly Johnson goes missing during an aid trip to an African tribal village. Linderby gradually realises that his wife has been snatched by slave traders  led by Suleiman Peter Ustinov  and he sets off on a continentwide pursuit which eventually leads to the Middle East.Along the way, big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles. William Holden has a poor cameo as a chopper pilot; Omar Sharif displays little of his customary charm or grace as a pampered Arab millionaire; Rex Harrison looks rightfully bored during his brief role as a helpful contact who assists Caine in his quest. The film is based on a bestseller entitled Ebano, by the littleknown author Alberto VasquezFigueroa, but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation. Ustinov is charismatic as the slaver he seems in all his movies to be incapable of giving bad performances, and Caine generates believable anguish as the man who thinks he will never see his wife again. There are occasional flashes of action, but on the whole Ashanti is quite slowmoving. All in all, it is a resistible piece of action hokum  not by any stretch as awful as Caine has frequently suggested, but not a very inspiring film and certainly a letdown from all the talent involved.","label":0},{"index":4536,"txt":"With a Bo Derek movie, the audience get just what they expect.

It is about a girl named Robin Played by Olivia DAbo who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her fathers life. So the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments, she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named Tommy Played by Keanu. Robin, when not in training, works parttime, along with her mother and stepsister, at a Laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather. Eventually she is chosen to compete. Overall, Keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star, and it is also not one of the worst movies ever, but still far from good. The DVD itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old VHS and towards the end, the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over, it fades to black, even though sound can still be heard.

So I figured from Ebert saying that I would see if it was really as bad as he said it was. I know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but I could not express how much I hated this piece of junk like Ebert did and never since Eberts review of Rob Reiners North where he said he hated that movie ten times had I ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review. Here we have Richard Dreyfuss as a gangster which I do not think it would be terrible to see Dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well. But above all the other things that were awful about this movie I can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all. While the movie starts off with Jeff Goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching Dreyfusss girlfriend while Dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits. But after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot. Then there are a whole bunch of jokes about Dreyfuss being mentally ill. Haha. Not funny. Then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying Frank Sinatras My Way sang by Gabriel Byrne apparently to insult Dreyfuss. Of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader Dreyfuss shoots Byrne over five times and Byrne just will not die. Are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny? I can certainly tell you I did not care or find that funny. Not only am I disappointed in Dreyfuss who I admire much as an actor for producing and starring in this tripe but I am also extremely disappointed in Jeff Goldblum because this was released the same year that Independence Day was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history. Did Goldblum feel that Independence Day would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if Independence Day were a bomb? What did an Oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this? The opening sequence of Mad Dog Time says that the movie is set on another planet. I only wish now that I have wasted 93 minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of 93 minutes out of my life that I will never get back. Ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough I am afraid. Every copy of Mad Dog Time should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire.

Their quality varies. Some of them are average but decent Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Swamp Devil, some are laughably bad, and then there are some that are truly terrible. Raptor Planet lies in the latter. Raptor Planet, a loose sequel to the 2004 SciFi Channel Original Raptor Island, is a barely watchable mess of a film with truly horrid acting and lazy scriptwriting. The effects that bring the dinosaurs to life a combination of puppetry and animatronics as well as CGI and stock footage from Raptor Planet are some of the worst looking effects I have seen in a low budget film. The gore effects are even unconvincing. The plot involves a bunch of commandos who for some reason I forget why travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs. That is right folks, the dinosaurs are aliens. Dinosaurs in outer space. What is next, sharks in space?!? The rest of the plot is simple. The human cast are picked off and eaten. By now, we have come to expect this in the numerous dinosaurs movies and novels that are released, but this is the first killer dinosaur movie I have seen where I actually became bored with all the dinosaur attacks.There are a few chuckles in it though. There is one scene that stands out in which a man is being munched by a Carnotaur brought to life by stock footage from the original film that seconds later becomes a giant raptor. Also, a bit of trivia, this is the scene where Steven Baur is shooting at his own death scene from the first movie. While Raptor Island was not a good film to begin with, its a masterpiece compared to its sequel.Believe me when I say, this is quite possibly the worst movie Syfy has ever aired.

I realize that it is his name that will ultimately sell this longforgotten After School Special, but at least give the woman some credit. Despite that, this has to be one of the worst teen sportsthemed films that I have ever seen, and it strives very hard to add not only every teen and sports movie clich\u00e9 from the class warfare between the feuding gymnasts to the teen romance. And, in striving to somehow deliver itself as an amateur alternative of Flashdance with the music in one of the warehouse dance scenes is even quite close to Michael Sembellos notable Maniac which was made famous by Flashdance, or was it the other way around?. It includes similar dance sequences and worse yet, even the 80s dance and sports traditions of corny danceoffs between the heroine and her antagonists, the one who doubts her successes and abilities on the team. We saw this in Trashin a vert ramp joust and Rad BMX dancing at the prom, although it was not much for competition, but rather for fun for example. In fact, this movie is chock full of unrealistic corniness, such as the somewhat homoerotic rolling in the clothes at the Salvation Army with Robin and her friend from the team.Nonetheless, the film is about a young girl who comes from a rather poor background. To top it off in a massive need to squeeze from audiences as much sympathy as possible, she lives with her ailing mother, her obnoxious sister, and her careless and slightly abusive stepfather. Needless to say, homelife is not so appealing. Add to the mix, a talent for gymnastics, but several obstacles to joining the team including the nuisance of her arrogant, snobby teammates, and a coach who also eventually doubts her abilities to compete well. And, of course, we cannot forget that she is got eyes for one of the pretty boy preppies who is dating one of the obnoxious teammates, nor that she does not have a steady boyfriend although Keanu as Tommy later enters the picture. Could this kid be any more pathetic? And it seems that one mess after another comes along to embarrass herself in her painfully long, redundant, and clich\u00e9d quest to prove her worth to everyone.But, even the major moments of cheesiness which comprise most of the film, are hardly worth mentioning considering that the biggest distraction to this film is the horrible acting and dialog. I like how the gym coach suddenly appears at the diner in the middle of the danceoff to scold the teammates. It makes episodes of Amazing Stories look like Shakespeare.I imagine anyone able to locate this film and watch it these days is probably drawn to it mostly because of the nostalgic factor.

I have inquired her about a lot of things, and gone to all the interviews that she was asked to go to. I have read the entire book written about Raider, Wichita is my hometown and I was surprised that such a thing could happen in Kansas.There was another BTK movie on TV not too long ago, and I thought this one would have been better at portraying Dennis killings, maybe even have some intelligent touches to his motives.I am going to be very blunt with the flaws in this movie.

Dennis Raider was a very anal man and was a follow the rule book kind of guy. He was not as nice as the movie made him look, he was very polite and abrupt, business like. Same goes for his killings, as far as we all know. If you have seen his confession in court, you can already guess.And as for the obsession with the slaughter house? No. Never have I read or has Dennis Raider confessed to having a problem with animal cruelty or people squishing bugs. In fact, he practiced on cats and dogs for choking methods. Yet throughout the whole movie he was putting animals in his victims faces and acting like he cared about the wellbeing of them.Dennis Raider never killed the people that he knew, he confessed this, but in the movie in his first killing he tells the lady he knows her also.I really do not even want to go in to this movie, and I am already ranting.

This would have been a much better movie if they would just left that character out of the story.He adds nothing but mawkish, maudlin, very irritating melodrama. Maybe somebody decided that if they could not make Ryan believable they would just make him obnoxious. The problem with that is Who cares if a spoiled, whining, obnoxious jerk is dying? Not me.The ONLY thing this character has going for him is the fact that he is dying, and sorry, but that is just not enough. Dying does not make anybody special. We are ALL dying, sooner or later. It does not give anybody the right to expect sympathy while acting like a jerk.The other two characters, and the actors playing them David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah, are very much more interesting, and their story, without Ryans selfpitying interruptions, would have made a much better movie.

To my taste, either they are black and rippingly funny, or so light in tone to be unsatisfying as comedies or stories. That is a selfimportant way of saying I wanted to like The Man In The White Suit but found myself struggling to sit through its short run time.Textile worker Sidney Stratton Alec Guinness may be meek in manner, but he is doggedly committed to progress in the form of his attempts to invent a strand of fabric that cannot be broken or made dirty. Using a factory lab for his latest experiment, he toils against limitations both material and human  the latter being the benighted mill bosses who do not understand what he is up to, then figure it out and become even more committed to stopping him.It is small minds like yours that stand in the way of progress, Sidney complains, practicing in the mirror what he struggles to say to the Man.One problem with Man In The White Suit is that Sidneys vision of progress is awfully smallminded, too, more so even than that of the bosses or the laborers who also resent his work. My problem is more elemental For a comedy, White Suit is not funny. It is a rather earnest script which too often tries to mine its feeble attempts at humor from spittakes, doubletakes, tripletakes, and dizzy takes.The best joke is the sound of the machine Sidney toils at, going BleepBlopBleepBop endlessly and fetching queer looks from every visitor until Sidney either extracts his miracle from it or blows it up trying. Like every other bit of stray humor that functions decently in this film, it is leaned on too long.I have never seen Guinness less affecting in a movie, even though he looks impossibly young and earnest though actually in his mid30s. He seems so bloodless, even more so than the waxfaced general he played in Doctor Zhivago He is the same cold fish whether he is ignoring the sad affections of the affecting mill girl who offers to give him her life savings when he loses his job panfaced Vida Hope as Bertha or the more sultry charms of young Daphne Birnley Joan Greenwood, his one real ally in his fight against shabbiness and dirt, as she puts it, making those words sound as impossibly sexy as only Greenwood could.Supporting players make White Suit work as well as it does. Ernest Thesinger of Bride Of Frankenstein fame plays a singularly nasty captain of industry who looks like Nosferatu and makes a laugh like a death rattle. Howard MarionCrawford as another factory leader is as memorable here as he was playing a blinkered medical officer in Lawrence Of Arabia. Then there is the undeniable charm of Mandy Miller as a little girl who steals her few moments on camera right from under everyone else.But most of the scenes are played so straight that one would not think director Alexander Mackendrick had ever worked on a comedy before his previous Ealing comedy Whisky Galore does not reverse that impression, alas. Roger MacDougalls play posits the notion of scientific progress as potential disaster, but fails to present dull Sidney in anything other than the most blandly pleasant of lights.Ealing comedies are remembered for capturing the human side of comedy. Yet the Ealings I have seen never seem to do this, working only when they play aggressively against our own sympathies. Kind Hearts And Coronets and The Ladykillers Mackendrick again, go figure are classics this way. White Suit, on the other hand, is a pointless ramble that falls apart when it should cohere, just like that unfortunate suit.","label":0},{"index":4604,"txt":"The premise of this movie is revealed on the DVD box. A textile worker develops a miracle fabric that does not degrade. But the movie fails to get on with it. Instead it pads for 45 minutes, noodling around a preamble before he makes the big discovery. Since audiences do not benefit much from seeing a whiz kid figuring things out, it is a strange choice the movie has successfully been prevented from engaging any topic. Once the fabric is discovered, the movie too rapidly establishes that both industry bigwigs, and bluecollar coworkers want the invention squelched, leaving the movie with just two flimsy movements; inventing the chemical, and running from oppressors.I cannot understand why anyone would describe this as comedy. The tone is not funny or comical. It is more like serious social criticism of the day that capitalism warps both supply chains and production. Which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. Yes, that is probably true, but without some toying with an attitude towards that fact, the movie is simply an earnest argument.

There are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh, and it is due almost entirely to him being given the wiggleroom to do his thing. He is an undoubtedly talented individual, and it is a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be, in my opinion, a total trainwreck.With that out of the way, I will discuss what went horrifyingly wrong.The film begins with Dan Burns, a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column. He prepares his girls for a family reunion, where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other.The family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie. No family behaves like this. It is almost as if they have been transported from Pleasantville or Leave it to Beaver. They are a caricature of what we think a family is when we are 7. It reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating. Touch football, crossword puzzle competitions, family bowling, and talent shows ARE NOT HOW ACTUAL PEOPLE BEHAVE. It is almost sickening.Another big flaw is the woman Carell is supposed to be falling for. Observing her in her first scene with Steve Carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated.

They really should not have done the fourth part to the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.","label":0},{"index":4622,"txt":"The highlight of this movie for me was without doubt Tom Hanks. As Mike Sullivan, he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle an untraditional for him role. Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie  the one you like, admire and root for. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It is true that in the context of this movie he came across as somewhat noble  his purpose being to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son. Even so, he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings. So Hanks took a role I would not have expected him in, and he pulled it off well.Hanks good performance aside, though, I certainly could not call this an enjoyable movie. After an opening that I would best describe as enigmatic it was not entirely clear to me for a while where this was going it turns into a very sombre movie, about the complicated relationships Sullivan has developed as a gangster  largely raised by Rooney Paul Newman, who is a sort of mob boss, and trying to raise his own two sons and to keep them clean so to speak; isolated from his business. After the older son witnesses a murder, the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet, gets the wrong son and the mother, and leaves Sullivan and his older son Mike, Jr. on the run. It becomes a weird sort of fatherson bonding movie.Although it ends on a somewhat hopeful note at least in the overall context of the story it is really very dark throughout, that mood being reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rainfall. I have to confess that while I appreciated Hanks performance, the movie as a whole just did not pull me in. 410","label":0},{"index":4623,"txt":"This film is overblown, predictable, pretentious, and hollow to its core.

Gen is a total disappointment. i would have wonder, if Sahan was not this famous, would Togan be able to shoot this movie, with this much of budget amount?? i hope Togan would realize that it is not fashionable to play in a role as a director as he said in an interview. it was Hitchcock who did it wisely and Night Shyamalan continued it successfully! he should be aware of the fact that he is not Hitchcock nor Shyamalan yet!!!!hoping him to be more careful and creative next time in this big industry!","label":0},{"index":4626,"txt":"The title above is used to introduce the film Gen to its audience. Gen is about a young doctorDoga Rutkay with an ill mother. The film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job. While she drives, we realise that she is not that close home as the hospital is in a remote area. As soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital, she sees the death body of a patient. This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days.Two policemen comes to the hospital so as to investigate the suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions. All their communication with outside world is cut off too. There is no way out!! In those few days, there will be more nasty murders. Now everybody suspects from each other.In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It could have been very scary indeed. There are positive sides of the movie of course. I really like the beginning of the movie. Especially, when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital. Actings are okay. Some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though. I think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie. What I am saying is, it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the end, we should have realised that was coming when we see what is happening. The director needed to explain it altogether which I think did not work well. Also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least 48 years old but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. Lastly, I would like to say a few things about the director. I am sure he will improve. This is his first attempt. I have recently found out that he is only 21 years old. That made me feel more positive about him and his future films.

Similar to Unleashed which was great, Dog Bite Dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their masters bidding. The main characters, an emotionally undeveloped, amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer, are far from the common heroes and villains we often see. In fact, by the end, you lose track of who you are supposed to empathize with, failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the men \u0096 whether that was the failure of the director or perhaps the underlining message he was trying to tell is up to you to decide.Although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability, by the halfway point it slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge. The suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling. And in the end, you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary.On the plus side, the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to US movies \u0096 so those who are not familiar with Asian films and are tired of Hollywoods predictability should check it out.The white balance seemed off throughout most of the film. It was like looking into a picture shot on fluorescent when it was supposed to be set on tungsten. Maybe I am the only one, but it strained my eyes.The movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you \u0096 an interesting buildup gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was diverted to a low budget, low speed chase scene. And just when you think you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of Shakespearean tragedy, you realize that it is not an ending at all, but rather a transition into a wacky countrymusic montage about peace and serenity.Throw in some grisly frombehind choke scenes, a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into savagery and back again the other way, Asians fascination with bodily fluids and a horrible music score that did not match the film, and you get the average bland Asian thriller.I just do not get why every fight scene was overlaid with clips of roaring lions \u0085I thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs? Ultimately, in the end, we are reminded about a true killer that still lurks amongst us \u0096 tetanus.410","label":0},{"index":4630,"txt":"After watching this film, I was left with a two very annoyances about this film why did they make Chens character this McGuyver hitman and Lees character such an incompetent idiot? Chens characters background is that he was raised in an underground Cambodian orphanage for blood thirsty fighter where they learn to brawl it out to the death like wild dogs. This detail is pushed early on during a scene where he gets into a cab and as it starts to drive, he shows how he is unfamiliar with a seat belt. Soon after this scene, he has a similar situation at a dim sum restaurant. Not only is he uneducated, he is starving. This is not a reference to Chens scrawny physique but to the two early scenes in the film where he is scarfing down food, one of which, being rice porridge off the floor of the lower deck on an old ship. Si in the first ten minutes of the film, it is established that Chen is malnutritioned, unmodernized,and has only thing going for him, his dog brawling fighting style of some sort. Despite this situation, Chen manages to outshoot every policeman even managing to ricochet a bullet off a metal pipe to hit a guy in a head, whom was holding Chens girlfriend hostage and has somehow attained a super human strength swings a 50 lb block of concrete, plastered on the end of a metal pipe, to the head of the police chief AS he is getting shot in the chest, by said chief.Now Lees character...okay, I get it, he is depressed, he is got some baggage, but wow, can he do anything right? One moment, they try to make him cool, composed and ready to take care of business, and the next moment, he just got beat again. First scene he runs into Chen, and he manages to misses him, from approx 15 ft, multiple times. Toward the end of that scene, Lee watches Chen as his close friend and coworker gets slowly stabbed in the neck with a long knife for a good full 5 seconds, while holding a gun to Chen face, at a 10 ft distance. Even at the end of the movie, Lee manages to get stabbed to death and fails once again.And my biggest problem with this movie is that it is presented in a manner that film makers are trying to get the audience to sympathize with Chens character and that he is just killing to survive. That would be a lot easier if I did not just watch Chen kill innocent people throughout the whole awful movie. Of the numerous people he killed, only two people had the intention of trying to kill him, the police chief and Lee. Others were just people who were eating, boat owners, taxi drivers, and policemen trying to arrest him, not kill. Overall, Chens character is a just a cold blooded killer who kills for what he wants, even if its just a free ride. Did I mention he is carrying a wad of hundred dollar bills throughout most of the film?

Consequently, more foreigners visit the small town. But Edward and Tubbs, the owners of a local shop, which is actually far away from the town, do not like foreigners.

The costumes are suited to the actors, too. Tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters, for example Edward, have unappetizing black teeth. The show has a great deal of dark humour, typical British. The set design reflects the mood of the series. The village and all the houses look grey and are decayed.

Fans of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced will wonder if Pegg himself ever experienced similar feelings in real life with this film and to an extent Run Fat Boy Run as one of the UKs best comic talents being ruined by the US.All in all this is a forgettable comedy.

See our blog WhatToSeeNext for details on our rating system.Heres a movie that will have you clawing at your own face in an attempt to earn release from the onscreen tedium. You will not be wringing your hands, nor rolling your eyes, nor sighing into your popcorn. No indeed. For a movie of this averagousity, only clawing at your own face will do. When you begin to claw your own face  as begin you must!  start in at the lower portion. You will need your upper portion, with its handy tear ducts, intact for the Truly Tearjerking third act which may bring you to your knees if you have not clawed your way clear of the entire theatre by then. In a season celebrating Joe SixPack and Hockey Moms as the new Gold Standard for leadership and foreign diplomacy, permaybe a movie this tedium will be welcomed as A Thing that anyone could create. Watching it, however, is a much more dangerous undertaking. Heres our story... Sidney Young, the London publisher of a fourthtier celebrityentertainment magazine is just about to see his magazine go under. He needs a miracle, and what he gets is a phone call from New York City, in the USA.The publisher of Sharps magazine, Clayton Harding played by Jeff Bridges says Come work for me! With his own employees carrying out the fax machine out of his apartmentoffice in the background, saying Yes is a nobrainer.Soon Sidney is at work in New York City, doing allllllll the wrong things. His interviews consist of asking Broadway musical directors if they are 1 Jewish, and 2 gay. He kills the pet dog of Sohpie Maes, the industrys hottest movie star, when she leaves it in the magazines offices during a business luncheon.This is a spot of bad luck for everyone, for, among other things, Sidney imagines that he is in love with Maes, before he wakes up to the Dunst character.Worst of all, he totally alienates Alison Olsen played by winsome scriptingconfusion by Kristen Dunst, a colleague assigned to show him the ropes of the magazine and The Big Apple. We have, of course, been to a movie before, and so we know how this relationship is going to end up. This is therefore why we will need intact tear ducts for the movies third act.The problem with The Thing is, the script just never jells, excepting for the one tearduct set piece in which True Love prevails.Publisher Harding is supposed to be a sonofabitch who also wants to just throw the whole job over. The script never comes down firmly on one or the other sides of this dichotomy, however, and Bridges is left to twist and waffle in the breeze.Alison Olsen is supposed to despise Sidney Young, but whenever he comes up to her as he does constantly she makes a point of engaging him in conversation, instead of attempting to discourage his existence.The comedy of early scenes is built around a piglet destroying an expensive hotel room, and then taking the elevator downstairs to urinate on the expensive high heels of a celebrity at a cocktail reception.The hot starlet Maes confesses that she is attracted to Young because he is wounded. The character never shows us why he is wounded, however. This is yet another resultant of the movies mortally wounded script.At one hours and fifty minutes, This Thing feels longer and more deadly than Napoleons retreat from Moscow. It is uninspiring, unfunny, unredeemable, and not even rentable. Run Away","label":0},{"index":4650,"txt":"I too was intrigued by the high 8.5 rating for this film, and was very disappointed. I had just seen a couple of good foreign films and was looking forward to making it three in a row, but it was not to be. I went with a spanish speaking friend who felt the same way. There is not much of a plot, if any. I do not necessarily need that in a movie, but it needs to somehow entertain or bring me in. The best I could say would be that it aspires to be an Altmanesque film, albeit with an extremely small ensemble. Sure, there are moments, but a few moments easily get thinned out by 97 slow minutes of nothing. I do not understand the high rating for this film. I give it a 3.","label":0},{"index":4651,"txt":"An attempt at crossover to appeal to those who do not appreciate opera, exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time, it fails badly. All that is desirable in this movie is the opera, and one can best find a recording of Pavarotti doing what he does best. The plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his throat which has suddenly become troublesome. Only because it came out so long ago is it largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and has stage presence aside from his singing talent, and nothing that he does in this movie negates that opinion. His culpability lies in not rejecting the horrid script. Perhaps because great operas can have silly stories he tolerated this one.Who knows, except those involved? Do we need to know? The plot is weak and trite. This movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick off a few juicy tidbits the opera music hanging above the mud. We have other ways in which to appreciate the great Pavarotti, and this one is not one of them. Just get one of his many superb opera or vocalconcert recordings and recognize the master tenor where he is most suited.It would be one of IMDbs 100 Worst Films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes; it would fit neatly in a list including several efforts of singers, actors, models, and athletes to exploit their popularity through film. Very often it all goes badly wrong due to incompetent acting or a horrible script. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor had he not shown such a superb voice. However effective he is as an actor opera requires it, not even Jimmy Stewart could have rescued this turkey of a script.I give it a polite 3 of 10 because someone may have become a fan of Pavarottis singing and of opera because of this movie.","label":0},{"index":4652,"txt":"By my KoolAid drinkers remark, I mean that these are such devoted fans of the man Pavarotti that they make no attempt to objectively rate this film. Giving this a 10 is akin to giving Wally Cox the award for Mr. Universe or putting a velvet Elvis painting in the Louvre!!! When this film debuted, I remember the savage reviews with headlines such as No, Giorgio and some said it was among the worst films ever made. This is definitely overstating it as well. While bad and far from a great work of art, there was a lot to like about the film and the movies biggest deficit was not the acting of Pavarotti nor his girth.Believe it or not, the brunt of the blame rests solely on the shoulders of the writers who, I believe, were chimps. It is rare to see a movie with such clich\u00e9d dialog or goofy scenes like the food fight, but even they are not the heart of the problem. The problem is that the writers intend for the audience to care about a romance that consists of a horny married middleaged man and a seemingly desperate lady. Perhaps European audiences might be more forgiving of this, but in the United States in 1982 or today, such a romance seems sleazy and selfishespecially when Pavarotti tells Harrold that he loves his wife and this is just fun. Wow, talk about romantic dialog!! Sadly, if they had just changed the script a little bit and made Pavarotti a widower or perhaps had his wife be like the wife from a couple classic Hollywood films, such as from ALL THIS AND HEAVEN, TOO or THE SUSPECT where the wife was so vile and unlikable you could forgive the husband having an affair or even killing her. Instead, she is the loving mother of two kids who waits patiently at home while her egotistical hubby beds tarts right and leftas Pavarotti admits to having had many affairs before meeting Harrold.Sadly, even the gorgeous music of Pavarotti could not save this film. Towards the end of the film, there are some amazing scenes in New York where the set is just incredible and Pavarottis singing transcendent. For that reason, I think the movie at least deserves a 3. I really wanted to like the film more, but it was a truly bad filmthough not quite as rotten as you might have heard.Sadly, from what I have read, this film might be a case of art imitating life, as Pavarottis own life later had some parallels to this film, though this is not exactly the forum to discuss this in detail.","label":0},{"index":4653,"txt":"As others have said, No, Luciano is a more apt title or response to this movie title. For entertainment, the great opera singer should stick to singing.....not that he is a terrible actor. It is just that this movie stinks.The first 25 minutes were fine  a nice family movie, as it were  but after that it is nothing but a boring soap opera.Appropriately playing a singer, Pavarotti, as Giorgio Fini, loses his voice a few times and the doctor, Pamela Taylor Kathryn Harrold comes to the rescue. The singer then falls for the doctor, the doctor slowly falls for the singer, the two argue all the time and on and on and on it goes.Pavarotti has a winning smile and is a likable guy. It is Harrold that spoils things and after watching her here I am not surprised she did not become a star. There is nice scenery in the movie to enjoy, good shots of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the film. I got bored and do not remember much about the second half of it.","label":0},{"index":4654,"txt":"This movie is basically about some girls in a Catholic school that end up getting into trouble because of putting red dye in one in one of their school mates shampoo and after being reprimanded for this act they decide to take off to Florida for a vacation. On their way there they meet up with some guys in a local diner and decide that they would both meet up with each other in another location later on. The girls end up on a road side near the woods and stop for awhile and while one of the girls decides to walk around a bit she sees a murder happen in which the local sheriff himself is involved. She becomes scared and runs to tell the others what happened. The other girls decide to go take a look with her and two of them get killed by the killer. Then the two remaining girls are caught by the killer and are placed in local jail cell. The deputy sheriff meanwhile is keeping watch over the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the killer he ignores them both and acts as ignorant and everybody else in this movie who just cannot put two and two together much less some lousy detective work at that. The best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls where he decides to rape her in her jail cell and it seems that the girl actually WANTS to be raped by this man and the bare chest scene I admit was good but before their lips meet he has other things in mind. This movie reminds me of the lowbudget thriller Blood Song with Frankie Avalon staring in it, the same motive just a different character part. It is not a movie worth renting not even for an 80s lowbudget movie and the ending was the worst ending I have ever seen in a movie and it left me wanting my money back!","label":0},{"index":4655,"txt":"I saw this movie when I was really little. It is, by far, one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. Now, normally, I like weird movies, but this was just a bit too much.There is not much of a plot to the movie. If anything, it starts out like Toy Story, where toys come to life, and Raggedy Ann and Andy go on an adventure to rescue their new friend, Babette. From there, craziness ensues. There is the Greedy, the Looneys, a sea monster named Gazooks, and a bunch of pirates singing show tunes, all of which just made the movie weirder. Also, I cannot help but feel that Babette is annoying and a bit too whiny. She definitely did not help the movie.Now, even though I did not like this movie, there were a few cute parts. I liked the camels song. Even though it was a song about being lonely, it had a friendly feel to it. Then, there was Sir Leonard. While most of the Looneys were just plain nuts, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest. King Koo Koo was just a little dirtbag that made Dr. Evil look like a serious villain. Also, there was Raggedy Andys song, No Girls Toy. It was definitely good song for little boys who wanted to act tough. But, honestly, even these things did not make the movie any better. But remember, this is just my perspective. While I personally would not recommend this movie, even I have to admit, it does have its charming moments. See it if you are interested, but only if you are in the mood for something really out of the ordinary.","label":0},{"index":4656,"txt":"I had not heard of this film until I read an article about it on the Unknown Movies website, which made me curious. As a cartoonist and illustrator myself, I am an admirer of Richard Williamss work  I rate Ziggys Gift as one of the finest Christmas specials of all time, and even though Who Framed Roger Rabbit stopped being one of my favourite films when I got past the age of sixteen, I still have the highest of regard for the amount of work, care and attention to detail that went into creating the visuals  but it seems the man has his faults, most notably a propensity for going over budget and over schedule, and this film is a testament of just how far wrong even a supertalented individual like Williams can go, given the right circumstances.Raggedy Ann and Andy is a strange confection that tries to be weird and experimental and off the wall within the confines of a childrens cartoon. It tries also to be a musical. It tries to be a thousand and one other things as well  is it a freakout? Is it a mindblower? Is it a paean to the innocence of childhood imagination?  until it finally collapses under the weight of its own limitless ambitions and aspirations. It is beautifully animated, for the most part, though the bland backgrounds could have used a little more attention, but even that does not count for much when you are confronted with the hallucinogenic absurdity that constitutes much of the action here.There are a number of problems with the film, but let us start with Raggedy Ann and Andy themselves. They are the stars of the show, yet they have no personalities. Actually, we get the message that Andy is a wannabe tough guy I am no girls toy, he sings and that Ann has a unique perspective on things because her owner, a little girl called Marcella, carries her upside down, but that is all we get to find out about these dullasmud characters because the overwhelming weirdness of this film kicks in not long after. I use the word weirdness advisedly, because some weird films can be hugely entertaining, but this is just flatout strange. The toys and dolls in the playroom are supposed to be cute and lovable, but they are actually bizarre and disturbing. The two marionettes who do and say everything in sync are a prime example of this. But even they are relatively normal compared to the constantly sneezing pirate captain, whose moustache becomes erect and whose groin visibly swells when he first catches sight of a glamorous French doll. Yes, this is supposed to be a childrens film! Then there is the music, none of which is memorable, and all of which is sung by actors who cannot sing. And to add insult to injury, there is a lot of singing in this film. When Ann and Andy finally make it out of the playroom, the first thing they do is sing a LONG number in the woods about how scared they are, about how they will always have each other and...yes, we get the message. This seems to go on forever, but at least it brings some semblance of normality back to the film. Not for long, though, because the Camel with the wrinkled knees leads us into a bizarre world where everything looks like it is made from worn and faded denim, and  bad enough that he is clearly a paranoid schizophrenic  he also starts hallucinating. But this is nothing compared to the scenes that follow. The Greedy, a living, breathing. belching, farting, constantly eating pool of taffy, is so trippy, creepy and ultimately disturbing, you will hardly believe what you are seeing  this is as close to a drugfree psychedelic experience as I have ever seen on film. Then, after a long time spent with the Greedy, along comes the psychotic Sir Leonard Looney and his master King KooKoo, whose throne resembles a urinal. I cannot believe I am actually writing a capsule description of a real film here  I just had to rub my eyes and remind myself that I am not blogging about an overwhelmingly whackedout nightmare I had. Part of the sequence in Looney Land resembles one of the old Winsor McCay  Little Nemo cartoons, for no good reason other than somebody felt like doing it, probably. All this would be fine if there was some kind of rhyme or reason behind it, but there is not. These scenes are just strange, and very, very long. Surrealism only works when there is a strong idea behind it, or takes place against some semblance of reality. But NOTHING in these scenes points towards any kind of reality. Take away this element, and you are left with pure self indulgence.As the final scenes unravel, even the animation begins to look less impressive the pirate ship, ludicrously detailed, jerks about on the water in a manner that suggests some of the cels went missing during the production and there is a nonevent of an ending that simply suggests money ran out. Even at a meagre 86 minutes in length, the film feels like a neverending ordeal, and it is understandable why it flopped on its original release. Animation buffs will probably scratch their heads and wonder just how Williams managed to flub this one so spectacularly, but he did, and there is nothing anyone can do about it.","label":0},{"index":4657,"txt":"This is hands down the worst movie of all time.

I am leaning toward rip off. After that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better, almost to the point of being original. Bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story, but the film already surpasses many in the Yankee comes down South to get killed by a bunch of rednecks genre because it is actually shot in the South.A group of college girls head to Ft. Lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in Georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road. Note to Yankees stay on the highway when you go to Florida. Sue Ellen Lisa Stahl has to pee so she heads into the woods. When she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff Tony March strangle his mistress Merry Rozelle to death. Note to Yankees do not wander off into the woods when in the South; not because you might witness a murder, but you may run across a marijuana plantation. This is the point where the story, not the movie, actually comes close to being good.While Tony March will never have to practice his Oscar speech, his Sheriff Dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do. Tom Law is likable as Deputy Scott and is as authentic a Southern deputy as I have seen since Walton Goggins Deputy Steve Naish in HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES.A few scenes in the movie are worth the mention. The girls stop at a BBQ in South Carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out. Sue Ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her.And in the strangest scene, Sheriff Dean makes like he is about to rape Patty Carol Cadby and tells her to take off her clothes. Dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he is about to do. The preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his Bible. His sermon is about how Jezebel is saved by the blood of Jesus Christ. I feel sorry for this preachers flock.

I realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion, this movie has bred a deep hatred within me. I hate this movie so very, very much.Some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously. If only it did not take itself seriously. But it does. The plot is a warmed over version of Blade Runneresque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies.

That is true, but this is mostly a futuristic story, which looks a lot like Batman Forever with it is direction style and weird character designs. It was mismarketed, and should have been marketed as a futuristic tale, instead of just a lame cop comedy. Whether or not this movie is mismarketed, it is still a horrible movie.In the future, dinosaurs have been brought back to life through amazing technology, and they talk and walk around like humans. Teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously, but after a dinosaur is murdered, he is given the case to work on, but he has to be partners with the toughest cop of them all, Katie Coltrane Whoopi Goldberg. It is up to this mismatched duo to solve the murder, and it is up to the audience to stay awake long enough to make it through this piece of crud.Teddy starts the picture as a normal acting character, but by the end he is unbearable to listen to. For some reason along with being a detective, he is also a bad comedian and a bad impersonator. He does imitations of famous people and accents, and has some truly awful lines. Whoopi blames him for farting and he says, It is not my butt trumpet! Wow! What a puerile, immature line, even for a kids movie of this caliber. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. I was hoping Teddy would bite her head off the entire length of the film.This movie never knew what it wanted to be. When the futuristic scenes and action occur, there is no comedy or humor. In any nonaction scenes, the characters try to be as funny as they can, which just results in nonstop straight faced boredome. The action scenes do not work as they are too weird and not violent enough, and as stated earlier, the comedy is just a bunch of massacred jokes. Nothing ever works here.Having a dinosaurhuman detective duo seems like a pretty original movie, if nothing else. Nope! This movie is a huge ripoff of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Just replace dinosaurs with cartoons, and set it in the future, and it is the exact same plot. A man is killed, a dinosaur is killed. A dinosaur and detective solve the murder, a toon and detective solve the murder. The bad guys in Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and weasels. The bad guys here are a guy who sounds like Christopher Lloyd and guys who act just like the weasels. The club scene in Roger Rabbit where Jessica Rabbit walks down the stage is imitated with dinosaurs.

I have not been in this much pain watching a bad movie since I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start the review let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a 35 million dollar bust The New Line Cinema refused to put in theaters. They cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straighttovideo movie in decades. Whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck.Plot a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another Ice Age. A female cop named Katie Coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaur.The plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful. Whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail. Theodore Rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tailon accident and on purpose. I thought Burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to Theodore Rex the worst movie of Whoopis career.Do not let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable. I did not see that when I watched this movie. All I saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie Howard The Duck.

The Mother takes on the frightening form of Kali Mata to destroy our inner demons, and to terrify our egos. And though blood sacrifice is given to Kali and Durga, the events depicted in this film are just absurd. The Mother takes on a wrathful form to be wrathful to our inner demons, limitations, and ego when no other form will suffice. It is also in her wrathful form that she burns away all your Karmas in the Smashan fires that you cultivate in your heart for her to dance on if you love her, and she will bring you to reality and truth. Reality and truth has a dark side as well as light, which serves a purpose. The Mother is the embodiment of the physical Universe as well, she is Nature. Nature can be cruel and destructive to maintain balance. You cannot have growth and life without death and destruction. Kali represents the force of destruction for the purpose of new growth and life both mundane and spiritual in the universe. It is very outrageous to me that people who know nothing of India or it is divinity can just take one of our beloved Goddesses and use her like a cheap prostitute to make some lowbudget, talentless horror film. How dare they take our beloved Mother and portray her as a horror that makes people chop their eyelids off!? She is only horrific to those who are attached to their ego and who live in delusion , greed, anger, and other innerdemons. It is very clear to me that the person who wrote this movie must have a very serious selfdeluding ego, and serious innerdemons to see Kali as so horrible and terrible. When the ego drops away she becomes a form that is enchanting, beautiful, and young, a beauty that is so enchanting to behold that she enchants the entire Universe with it. Kali Maa is an ancient Mother, not to be trifled with for the sake of entertainment, let us just hope that in her endless compassion and mercy that she does not take on wrathful form to those involved with this movie.The audacity that Westerners have in using religions like my own, or the religions of the Caribbean Islands such as Santeria, and Vodou which are actually very positive, and other such religions to twist and exaggerate misunderstood elements that the Western mind cannot comprehend, is totally ridiculous. It is clear that there is no respect for what people live, breathe and believe in when it comes to these kind of flicks.Kali Maa in reality is a caring and compassionate mother, whom we shed tears at her beautiful feet in devotion and love for.

And the beginning of this is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn came out in 79, Lucio Fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it Zombie 2. That film is the one we know as plain ole Zombie. You know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark! OK so, after that flick named Zombie 2 in Italy came out and made a huge chunk of cash, the Italians decided, heck. Lets make some more zombie flicks! These things are raking in the dough! So Zombie 3 was born. Confused yet? The story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we have seen in a lot of American zombie flicks that we have seen before this one, the best comparison that comes to mind is Return of the Living Dead. Lets see...there is the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. Canister gets released into the general population and shebang! We get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh. A bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel. They gotta fight the zombies to survive.There was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie. First and foremost, Lucio Fulci the beloved godfather of gore from Italy was sick. So he could not really finish this film the way that he wanted to. The film was then handed down to two lesser directors Bruno Mattei Hell of the Living Dead and Claudio Fragasso Zombie 4. They did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good. You see Fulci himself did not really have his heart and soul on this flick. He was disenchanted with it. He gave the flick over to the producers and basically said Do whatever the hell you want with it! And god love them, they did.And that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great Fulci credited as its director. The main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore! There is no substance to it whatsoever! After the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it, the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies. Now in some cases this can prove to be fun, if 1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and 2 there is a lot of gore and guts involved.Here we get neither! Well there is some inspired moments in there, like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people. That was cool. There is also a scene involving a flying zombie head wich by the way defies all logic and explanation and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs. But aside from that...the rest of the flick just falls flat on its ass.Endless upon endless scenes that do not do jack to move the already non existent plot along. That was my main gripe with this flick. The sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically nonexistent. I hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished! I like my bmovies, but this one just really went even below that! Its closer to a zlevel flick, if you ask me.The zombie make up? Pure crap. The zombies are all Asian actors the movie was filmed in the Philippines so you get a bunch of Asian looking zombies. But thats not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway. Its the look of the zombies that really sucks! They all died with the same clothes on for some reason. And what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up more like smudges on their faces. One or two zombies had slightly more complex make up, but it still was not good enough to impress. Its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces. So not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap. These are supposed to be dead folks! Anyhows, for those expecting the usual coolness in a Fulci flick do not come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody elses flick. And those two involved Mattei and Fragasso did not really put there heart and souls into it. In fact, when you see the extras on the DVD you will see that when Fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick, he does not even take it to seriously. You can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they just had a job to do and they did it. And that my friends, is the last nail on this flick. There is no love, and no heart put into making this film. Therefore you get a half assed, crappy zombie flick.Only for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made.

It has some of the most laughable acting I have ever witnessed, especially from the main scientist character. His scenes with the General were just hysterical. Also, the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy, and the death scenes are often just downright stupid. This, of course, makes it all the more fun.

It is a film loved by mothers, grandmothers, and shutins who go to the movies once every five years. As a zombie movie, it blows. There is not a shambling corpse in sight, and it is terribly light in the gore department. Zombie 3, on the other hand, is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its bloodspilling  therefore, it is better than Gone With the Wind. It is also not overrated. Most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish. It is, however, not boring rubbish. After a terrorist steals a virus, he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter, and the chemicals leak into the ground. The terrorist, who has been exposed to the nasty concoction, hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesheating zombie. One of his first victims is a cleaning lady. Once she is bitten, Lucio Fulcis brand of hell breaks loose. As usual for a Fulci flick, the acting is atrocious, the storyline is riddled with plot holes, and the gore is plentiful. Turns out the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature. It is badly shot, too, poorly edited, and the sound design is flat.

However, due to the earlier import of George Romeros Dawn of the Dead, which had gone by that name for its Italian release, it was retitled to Zombi 2. Which also had the bonus of letting the audience think this was a sequel to the second Romero movie. Continuing this theme, the second Zombi film, which would have been called Zombi 2, was then consequently titled Zombi 3. In the UK, the original Zombi film that is, Zombi 2 was titled Zombie Flesh Eaters. To continue THIS theme, the second Zombi film Zombi 3 was then titled Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 for its UK release. Are you following all this? So if Zombie Flesh Eaters was Fulcis Dawn, then is 2 his Day of the Dead? While this is only a flippant observation, this tale of military compounds, helicopters and a plodding narrative certainly does bear a vague thematic resemblance.Some of Fulcis European direction compels in a film like this, but the acting, dubbing and expositionheavy script are absolutely horrendous. Its ecological message is so forced and overstated it can no longer be considered a subtext, while there is an unintentionally hilarious Birds homage. Combining this last element with MOR 80s rock is not a good idea. For some reason I could not stop thinking of Time of the Apes q.v. the whole time I was watching this. This is obviously not a good thing.While there is nothing here to rival topless scubadiving, shark wrestling zombies and eyeballs on a splinter, Fulcis misogynistic leanings do get a work out with a hotel cleaners mouth being ground into a mirror until it gushes blood. His fannish gore predilections also see a hand severing. Both themes are combined when a womans face is ripped off, first by one zombie, then a zombie foetus that tears out of a pregnant womans stomach.Productionwise, this is obviously a step up from Zombi, coming five years later. Nine years in worldwide release terms. But without the originals lowkey charm it struggles, while Stefano Mainettis music is inappropriate and uninspired. Fabio Frizzis score was one of the best things about the 79 movie. Here zombie attacks are played out to what sounds unnervingly like Bonnie Tylers Holding Out For A Hero. In the middle of this carnage we get an irksome love interest, and Roger and Kenny, two bland macho types who do everything with acrobatic urgency and constantly state the obvious. We are out of ammunition to a stalling gun is a particular standout. But where it also falls down is in the zombies themselves. Low key or not, Fulcis original had truly magnificent, rotting zombies. Skull faces, worms in eye sockets... they really were something to behold. By contrast, this dull followup opts for the more traditional men with a bit of paint on their faces option. The climax rips off too many Romero movies to even be funny, while the use of the DJ is a crass and cheap narrative device. Not containing the same elements of outrage and gratuitous nudity of the first, this is unlikely to have the same cult appeal. It turns out that Fulci actually walked out on the project after reportedly directing just fifteen minutes, the rest filmed by Bruno Mattei. I am fairly sure that even Fulci would have balked at the ludicrous flying zombie head scene, and so credit to the director for having the good sense to leave. Unfortunately, however, it is his name that is above the film title on releases, so the majority of people will be left with the impression that this is a Fulci film through and through. On that scale then it is a major setback for him, for this movie commits what you imagine Fulci would regard as the worst crime of all that of being boring.","label":0},{"index":4700,"txt":"This movie was recently released on DVD in the US and I finally got the chance to see this hardtofind gem. It even came with original theatrical previews of other Italian horror classics like SPASMO and BEYOND THE DARKNESS. Unfortunately, the previews were the best thing about this movie.ZOMBI 3 in a bizarre way is actually linked to the infamous Lucio Fulci ZOMBIE franchise which began in 1979. Similarly compared to ZOMBIE, ZOMBI 3 consists of a threadbare plot and a handful of extremely bad actors that keeps this horror trash barely afloat. The gore is nearly nonexistent unless one is frightened of people running around with green moss on their faces and the English dubbing is a notch below embarrassing.The plot this time around involves some sort of covert military operation with a bunch of inept scientists ie. an idiotic male and his stupid female sidekick who are developing some sort of chemical called Death One that is supposed to reanimate the dead. Unless my ears need to be checked, I do not even recall a REASON for the research of Death One. It seems to EXIST only to wreak havoc upon the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to star in this cinematic laughfest.Anyway, Death One is experimented on a corpse whom I swear looked like Yul Brynner, and after it is injected into his system, he sits upright and his head explodes! The sound effects are also quite hilarious  as the corpses face bubbles with green slime, the sound of paper crumpling can be heard. The Death One toxin is transported outside and is hijacked by a group of thieves where one makes off with it, but infects himself after cutting himself on an exposed vial.Needless to say, the guy turns into a zombie, but not before he makes his timely escape to a cheap motel, infects a lowly porter and murders a maid by pushing her face into a bathroom mirror!. The military catch wind of this and immediately take action before eliminating everyone who is unlucky enough to be within the contamination zone and turn the motel upside down. They find the infected thief and burn his body, only to have the smoke infect a flock of birds that are flying over the chimney stack!.We cut to the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the army, listening to groovy music that is coming out of a little dinky boombox while trailing a trailerload of slutty girls who are leaning out of the windows and showing off their chests. Can someone say zombie food? We also have a subplot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to inspect a group of birds lying on the road... the same birds that were infected by the zombie smoke! The birds attack the boyfriend and the girl drives off to a deserted gas station to seek water. This is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments of the movie. She walks around this old dirty, rusty and obviously abandoned building where she continues to ask aloud, HELLO? IS THERE ANYONE HERE? PLEASE, I JUST NEED SOME WATER! She encounters a group of zombies, one of which is chained to a wall ! and the other is swinging a machete. After a bit of rumbling and tumbling around on the ground, she escapes but not before blowing up the gas station with her lighter.Meanwhile, the birds attack the trailerload of whores and one girl gets pecked and infected. They all pull up to the same motel where the original infection took place, and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film takes place. After a matter of hours a day at the most, the same motel is now caked in dust, has vines growing throughout it, and looks like it has been sitting derelict for years. Anyway, what better place to take refuge than this particular building? Needless to say, the group begins to break down as several people walk off together to get themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack.The third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman who explore a deserted village, of which the woman comments, THIS PLACE IS A DUMP! She then proceeds to get pushed off a balcony by a zombie into pirahna? infested water where she has her legs bitten off and turns into a zombie within seconds! Meanwhile, her friend back at the motel who got pecked and infected HOURS earlier is still TURNING into a zombie!Unfortunately, there are just too many inconsistencies in this movie that makes this movie just too stupid for words. For example, the time rate concerning infected people being zombified differs greatly. Sometimes it takes seconds, other times it takes hours. Some zombies run, others drag their feet and walk really slow. Some even do kungfu moves, while others hide under stacks of hay to surprise people. Some of the zombies even talk! The funniest moment of course is the infamous zombie head in the fridge gag which elevates itself in midair and attacks a stupid man who goes looking for food. Funnily enough, his girlfriend gets her throat torn out by it is headless counterpart LMAO!.The biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of storylines involving the people who are in fact killed by zombies. We never get to see them come back as zombies, in fact the only ones we do see zombified are the ones pecked by the birds and the one girl who gets her legs bitten off. Other than that, I was at least expecting the couple who were killed in the kitchen andor the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as zombies. It is also amazing that these zombies only take a few bites and then move on to their next victim. The most laughable moment was of course the zombie fetus. A pregnant woman who has been infected lies on a bed in a hospital. A woman who seems to have a lot of medical knowledge tries to deliver the baby ! and has her face pulled off by a zombie, before having her head pushed into the womans stomach where a hand bursts out and proceeds to rip the rest of her face off. Timeless!As usual, all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre. The megalomaniacal military officer, the pathetic useless squealing women who scream to get killed, the obvious characters who are ABOUT to get killed ie. watch for the man chasing a chicken! I guess this movie really is a comedy. There were many laughable scenes, such as the shed that gets blown up with a hand grenade obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent and a climatic scene where a man screams, I am THIRSTY.... THIRSTY FOR YOUR BLOOD!. The costumes are really bad  the same zombies reappear throughout the course of the film, wearing the same Asianlike clothing that may be found in a Bruce Lee film, and watch out for the blue 60s skirt the girl at the motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend bump into the infected man.The end of the film leaves open the door as usual for the apocalyptic storyline. A radio DJ who narrates throughout the whole movie turns out to be a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the beginning of the end while the two survivors take off in a helicopter. Hardly DAWN OF THE DEAD material if you ask me.Regardless, this movie does deliver many laughs. The gore is minimal, and what gore there is, it is very unconvincing, let alone unimaginative. The usual mix of black blood, thick green goo oozing out of weeping sores and zombie makeup consisting of green moss. ZOMBI 3 makes for a good rental for a sleepover party or a night of beer and popcorn. Other than that, horror fans should stay away.3 out of 10","label":0},{"index":4701,"txt":"Zombie Review 3SpoilersFew films are actually so bad they are good, and Zombi 3 is not just bad, it is wretchedly, unforgivably bad in so many ways that a whole new language may be needed just to describe them allMore than that, it is a film credited to Lucio Fulci that even by his standards has absolutely no coherency, sense or reason. However we cannot blame Fulci as it was not really directed by him but by Bruno Mattei, who does not even have Fulcis sense of style to help carry the film. Mattei seems to have brought little to the film but staggering ineptitude.So, I am ashamed to say how much I enjoyed every worthless minute of Zombi 3. It has no redeeming features  in a genre known for thin characters, weak story, and lack of film making skill, Zombi 3 pushes the boat out but in doing so it is even funnier than Nightmare City.The action starts when the Death 1 gas is stolen from a military base, and damaged in the escape. Who is the thief, why did he steal it, and why did the US military think that creating cannibalistic legions of the living dead would be a good idea? All these questions and more will fail to be answered in Zombi 3....After hiding out at a hotel, the infected thief goes mad from all the green plastecine growing on his face before being tracked down by the army who somewhat foolishly decide the best way to dispose of his corpse will be to burn it, sending Death 1 up into the atmosphere resulting in... zombie birds! Who then attack people and turn them into zombie people!!! if zombies are cannibals, why do not the zombie birds just attack other birds?Then we meet our heroes, a trio of horny GIs and a coachload of girls. There is a couple of other guys with them too, but they are not important  NO ONE is important here. You will be hard pressed to remember anyones face, let alone their name or find a reason to care about them. They end up hiding out at the same hotel as the thief a week ago this place was buzzing with life, now it is buzzing with flies! but there is no escape from the undead.By this point you will either be completely sucked in or you will have turned the damned thing off. The script is so appalling even the greatest acting in the world could not save it, so it is just as well they have some of the worst  and not just the human characters, the zombie acting here is an all time low. There is no consistancy in how the zombies behave  some shamble about in the time honored style, others engage in full on fist fights or charge around with machettes, not to mention the zombies who are still able to talk a gimmick that gives the film it is HORRIFYING TWIST ENDING. They die from gunshots to the chest rather than the head and even get knocked out by a good lefthook. How can you punch out a zombie???!!!!! In fact the emphasis on badly done 80s action often makes it resemble an episode of V...The zombies also spend a lot of time hiding, seemingly waiting for hours in ridiculous places on the chance some poor sap will pass by and get the fright of their life. They hide in bushes, in garages, in huts, on roofs, in the water, and even underneath pregnant women. At one point a zombie follows a woman up the stairs. To kill and eat her? No! To push her into the water, those zombies and their wacky sense of humour!There is plenty of gore though. Limbs are hacked, wounds ooze green pus, and there is much in the way of flesh eating and people getting their faces mushed in. There is nothing to match the originals eyeball piercing, but if bad make up effects are your bag you will not be let down.All this and I have not even mentioned the awful music, the inexplicable flying zombie head, the scientist whose acting actually manages to stand out as REALLY bad, or the final chilling punchline.... in an ingenious twist on the originals radio station being overrun by zombies, Zombi 3 gives us an actual zombie DJ!! He is gone over to their side! our escaping heros cry, before vowing to continue fighting against the undead in a sequel that sadly never came.Zombi 3 is rubbish  it would be no loss to the world if every single print was destroyed and all records of it is existence erased, yet somehow I feel my life is richer for having seen it.Did I say richer? I meant 88 minutes shorter...","label":0},{"index":4702,"txt":"Zombi 3 starts as a group of heavily armed men steal a experimental chemical developed to reanimate the dead, while trying to escape the man is shot at  the metal container holding the chemical is breached. The man gets some of the green chemical on a wound on his hand which soon after turns him into a flesh eating cannibalistic zombie. Within hours the surrounding area is crawling with the flesh easting undead on the look out for fresh victims, Kenny Deran Sarafian  his army buddies find themselves in big trouble as they stop to help Patricia Beatrice Ring  her friend Lia Deborah Bergammi who has been pecked by zombie birds !. General Morton is in charge of the situation  has to stop the zombie plague from spread throughout the whole world! But will he  his men succeed?This Italian produced film was to be directed by Italian zombie gore film auteur Lucio Fulci but the story goes he suffered a stroke  therefore could not finish the film so producer Franco Gaudenzi asked second unit director Bruno Mattei  writer Claudio Fragasso to step in  complete the film. Apparently Mattei  Fragasso did more than just finish it they actually disregarded a lot of the footage Fulci shot  added a lot of their own  Zombi 3 ended up as nearly a straight 5050 split. The script by Fragasso is an absolute mess, none of it is well thought out  is just as stupid as it gets. The scenes of zombie birds attacking people are not only technically inept but the whole idea is just absurd. The zombies themselves have no consistency whatsoever, look at the scene where Patricia is on the bridge  the zombies are slow as they shuffle along but then look at the scene earlier on where she was attacked by the zombie with the machete because that one runs around like it is on steroids, then for no reasonable explanation about 10 minutes before the film finishes the zombies suddenly develop the ability to speak which also looks daft. There are so many things wrong with Zombi 3, scene after scene of terribly thought out  ineptly directed action, awful characters  really dull broken English dialogue which does not make sense half the time. Then there is the embarrassing scene where the zombie head inside the fridge suddenly develops the ability to fly through the air  bite someones neck, the scene when the guys in white contamination suits at the end are about to kill Kenny  Roger but instead of using their automatic rifles they decide to try  kill them by hand, even when Kenny picks up a gun himself they still refuse to use their rifles  when Kenny starts to shoot them all they still refuse to use their rifles  it is one of the most ineptly handled scenes ever put to film  then there is the end where Kenny takes off in the helicopter but cannot rest it down on the ground for literally a few seconds to pick his buddy up  then a load of zombies suddenly spring up from under some piles of grass, what? Since when did zombies hide themselves yet alone under piles of grass? This all may sound fun but believe me it is not, it is a really bad film that is just boring, repetitive  simply does not work on any level as a piece of entertainment except for a few unintentional laughs.It is hard to know who was responsible for what exactly but none of the footage is particularly well shot. It has a bland lifeless feel about it  for some reason the makers have tried to bath every scene in mist, the problem is they clearly only had one fog machine  you can see that at one corner of the screen the mist is noticeably thicker as it is coming straight out of the machine  thinning out as it disperses across the scene. Since a lot of it is set during the day it does not add any sort of atmosphere whatsoever  when they do get it right  the mist is evenly spread across the screen it just looks like they shot the scene on a foggy day! The direction is poor with no consistency  it just looks  feels bottom of the barrel stuff. Even the blood  gore is not up to much, there is a gory hand severing at the start, a scene when something rips out of a pregnant womans stomach, a legless woman what actually took her legs off in the pool by the way  why did not it take the legs off the guy who jumped in to save her?  a few OK looking zombies is as gory as it gets. For anyone hoping to see a gore fest the likes of which Fulci regularly served up during the late 70s  early 80s will be very disappointed, there are not any decent feeding scenes, no intestines, no stand out head shots  very little gore at all.Technically the film is poor, the special effects are cheap looking, the cinematography is dull, the music is terrible, the locations are bland  it has rock bottom production values. This was actually shot in the Philippines to keep the cost down to a minimum. The entire film is obviously dubbed, the acting still looks awful though  the English version seems to have been written by someone who does not understand the language that well.Zombi 3 is not a sequel to Fulcis classic zombie gore fest Zombi 2 1979, it has nothing to do with it at all apart from the cashin title. I am sorry but Zombi 3 is an amateurish mess of a film, it is boring, it makes no sense, it is not funny enough to be entertaining  it lacks any decent gore. One to avoid.","label":0},{"index":4703,"txt":"I admit that the majority of this film was uninspired,but i was still entertained. It has a wonderful sense of frenetic energy,above average music,and the women in the film fiercely defend themselves,there is no prissies here.

And I dont much care for whatever Fulcis excuses were, there was no excuse for this film going how it went. This was a bad film all the way around, yet I still cant give it below a 4 out of ten, which is what I gave it, because well...at least I was able to laugh at this misfit of a movie.I had to imagine these zombies, that were all over the ceilings of these buildings everywhere...had to imagine that they were either bored as hell so they crawled up on the beems, and perched themselves high on stone erections, or they saw the fleshy living motley band of jerkoffs coming around, so they took it upon themselves to stage numerous aerial ambushes. Hell, what else is there to do when youre dead?I had to laugh at some zombies performing what looked to be martial arts swings, kicks, and jumps, and some shambling about like traditional meatlovers. I feasted my eyes on a floating head that was never explained. I watched in pure horrific delight as the land they were in, the Phillipenes, was absolutely engulfed in fog, heavy doses of fog, and that the ponds were as they were boiling castle moats. I had to even cringe when I saw that the design for a cure for this plague was sketched on a chalkboard as an octagon with lines stretching from each angle, with Dead One written in the middle. I had to ask myself...if the science of curing zombies is that easy, then I wonder if I could come up with a little something to start a zombie outbreak here!All in all the effects were overboard, the dubbing horrid, Im sure the original acting as poor, the story absurd, the zombies inconsistent, even in a bad way they couldve all been similar, and the women ugly, but I found myself enjoying this thing.

I do not know why I do not like it... I mean it has almost everything i want out of a horror movie blood, outrageousness, unintentional humor, etc. According to this evidence it should be my favorite. Still, Zombi 3 is a baaad movie.There are just too many things that compels you to yell at the screen. Like when the girl leaves the army guy when their car breaks down to find water this spoils nothing so do not worry. She walks into what I see as an abandoned hotel or something. Did she not see that there was a friggin lake in the middle of the building??? Yes she is looking for water and passes up a lake. Why? Cuz she wants to know why the people who are not there cuz the place is abandoned will not answer her when she calls out Is anybody there? Oh this is just a little, insignificant piece of the big picture I am painting.There is a reason, though, why I gave this film more than 1 star. It is one of those movies where if you forget how bad it really is, like I have a few times, you will want to watch it again because it is just so overthetop in every aspect. I called it blood in the first paragraph, but this movie has no blood, it has an ocean of gore. Also, it has pretty weird creatures in it as well a zombiebaby with an adultsize hand??? and a magically flying head to name just two.You know when you try to think of the worst and cheesiest movies ever made and you come up with 50s scifi movies?

Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 of 1988, which he made with two other directors, Bruno Mattei and Claudi Fragasso, was quite a disappointment. Especially compared to its great predecessor, Fulcis very own Gore classic Zombi 2 aka. Zombie Felsh EatersZombie of 1979, this is vastly disappointing. Sure, the low rating of 4.5 already suggests that it is not a good film, but, these low ratings usually come from people who are not into Italian Zombie flicks, and as enthusiastic fan of Italian Horror films and lowbudget Exploitation cinema, I love many films that have only been rewarded with much lower ratings. Also, many of my fellow Italian Horror buffs seem to think of this film as underrated, which I sadly cannot agree with. Not that the film was a complete disaster. It has some redeeming qualities, above all Fulcis nauseating gore effects, that are always a pleasure to watch for an Italian HorrorGore buff. The basic idea behind the film is also not bad allthough far from original and I liked the ruthless portrayal of the military. Sadly, that is about it. While the great predecessor Zombi 2 was extremely gory, but beyond that also genuinely creepy, this is not creepy or scary for a minute, and the nauseating and often grotesque gore is the only true reason to watch Zombi 3. The film is sometimes fun to watch, but only for the gore, and as an unintentional comedy. I guess that it was mainly the gore that came from Fulci, and the disappointing rest that came from Mattei and Fragasso, the first of which was involved in a bunch of nasty cultflicks such as DAmatos Porno Holocaust, and the second of which is responsible for one of the worst movies ever made, the godawful Troll 2. Overall, this is definitely watchable for the gore, but, out of all Fulci films I have seen so far, this is definitely the worst, and I have seen the majority of this great filmmakers repertoire. I am a Fulci fan, and I always will be, but this sure is not his magic moment. It may be fun for the gore, but I recommend to watch any other Fulci film before this!","label":0},{"index":4712,"txt":"Next to the slasher films of the 1970s and 80s, ones about the walking dead were probably the second most popular horror subgenre. While slasher films had Black Christmas and Halloween to get the whole thing going, zombie flicks had George Romeros Dead films. And unsurprisingly soon after the success of his first two in the series, other directors wanted to cash in. A lot of Italian directors were especially interested, such as Lucio Fulci who brought us Zombie a year after Romeros Dawn of the Dead, known as Zombi in Italy and some other countries, and it was there that Fulcis film was known as Zombi 2. Apart from the walking dead it has no relation to Romeros film, but is a good film in it is own right. It was a big success in Europe and 9 years later a sequel was born.Pros Lots of beautiful, lush scenery. Awesome score. The acting is not exactly good, but the cast is game and seem to be enjoying the experience. After kind of a slow start, the pace moves along like that of an action flick. Plenty cheese and unintentional hilarity for bad film lovers. Good job on the makeup effects. Lots of blood and some decent gore.Cons Virtually plot less. Nothing you have not already seen before. Blatantly rips off some things from the first couple of Return of the Living Dead films. Cardboard characters. Has not aged too well due to the bad 1980s rock musicNot that I am saying all rock music of that period is bad, clothing, and overall feel of the movie.Final thoughts First of all, this is not a true sequel to Fulcis cult classic. In fact, I do not know if it was ever meant to pick up where that film left off. For those that do not know, Fulci was ill during production and ended up leaving and was replaced with Bruno Mattei. Matteis films are pretty laughable, but like this film many are good campy fun. And that is all this film really is, just something to watch for fun.My rating 3.55 Sobadit isgood rating 25 Serious rating","label":0},{"index":4713,"txt":"I thought that Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was quite a good horror film When a terrorists body, infected with a stolen chemical, is recovered by the US military, the corpse is then cremated, releasing the virus into the atmosphere over a small island.

It is fast paced and fun, but ultimately daft. Having said that it deserves to be trashed because of screwing up what could have been a good follow up to the seminal original. It is clear for those who have seen the awful Zombie Creeping Flesh that the films massive shortcomings can be owed to Bruno Mattei, and that the little that is commendable about it can be owed to Fulci. This is not idle Fulci sycophancy, the directors styles are starkly contrasted throughout, and you can tell who directed what, particularly in Matteis case.The film is centered around the outbreak of a virus oddly referred to as top secret by a scientist, it is secrecy apparently being more noteworthy than its potentially apocalyptic effect on mankind somewhere in south east Asia. The virus causes zombie like behaviour in those affected, and the virus quickly spreads across a seemingly arbitrary area of land. Our protagonists unwittingly wander into the danger zone, and have to fight for their lives against hordes of infected Asians.The film seems to be stuck half way between being a zombie gore flick, and an out and out action adventure, and this confusion is captured most clearly by the zombies themselves. They do not appear to have a set of characteristics common to all. Some are of the regular soulless shuffling variety, so well rendered in the original, and probably Fulcis creation here. The other main group consist of those who in being infected with the virus lost all sense of themselves, but incurred a savage aggression and a desire to earn a black belt in ninjitsu Indecisively leaping around unsure of whether to continue honing their upper roundhouse technique or engage with their brethren in what looks like a mass tickle fest on their hapless victims. Martial arts skills are not their only talents either, they are well versed in guerilla tactics, hiding on rafters and under bales of hay, and sometimes inexplicably falling from nowhere but the heavens themselves. This is all definitely the work of Mattei.There is a third, more chatty, variety of zombie. This type apparently retain a sense of irony as well I am really thirsty...FOR YOUR BLOOD. The ridiculous twist at the end in which the DJ turns zombie but continues to preach ad libbed gibberish about the fate of mankind, only serves to enhance the WTF factor and obliterate any hope of a serious resolution.Then there is the infamous zombie head which slowly propels itself through the air, a jokerish skeletal grin wrought across its face, as if to say yeah we know how bad this looks.The characters are all utterly one dimensional as you would expect. But its the pseudo comical dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from taking their plight seriously. Having said that the first soldier to die does put up an impressively valiant display against an unstoppable zombie menace. Indeed this is the first and perhaps only time we hit real zombie agro, and one of the only effective scenes in the film.The guy who played the chief scientist has heart, but no talent, utilising pauses in his lines entirely at random, so he ends up sounding like a confused asthmatic. The scientists on screen attempts at finding an antidote are totally unconvincing now lets put these two molecules together! There are a few moments that stick out as genuinely effective however. In an early scene a female protagonist explores an abandoned garage. Upon entering a room we are confronted with a hazy view of a shifting figure in the corner and a squirming mass on the floor, all shot in an atmospheric diffused light. The silence is interrupted by the appearance of a speedy machete wielding zombie who trashes everything in his wake in his alarming desperation to have her. His sheer aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real horror in the film. The before and after theme conveyed through the hotel that plays host to the happenings of the earliest stage of the outbreak, and later as a refuge to our protagonists is imbued with an thick humid ambiance. There is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a boarded up room that clearly houses hordes of the undead, and this is quite tense. Things become more dramatic when they board themselves in the hotel unknowing to what lurks upstairs. But this is sloppily handled and not nearly as effective as it could have been.All in all I would say this film may just about deserve to be called a royal screw up of a potentially effective tropical zombie fest, rather than simply a through and through bad film. If nothing else it has plenty of the unintentional laughs that I have come to expect from just about anything Italian and gory from the eighties.","label":0},{"index":4715,"txt":"Only on a very rare occasion does an episode of the xfiles fail to generate any excitement or does the episode contain anything which is just totally boring to watch.A detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstances.The deaths are linked to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths took place.Mulder has devised a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues has come back reincarnated as the little girl and is exacting revenge.Now for the bizarre bit.The little girl has no connection at all and seems to just a random person chosen as the reincarnation.I think this was slightly lazy writing by the writers and this episode ranks as one of the worst in xfiles history!","label":0},{"index":4716,"txt":"Born Again is a substandard episode from season one.

I consider Breaking the Waves nothing less than a masterpiece. I loved Dancer in the Night. I admired the idea in Dogville but the overall exercise looked to me too dry and too theatrical, less cinema. Europa which I see only now was a famous film at its time, succeeded in the US the relative success of an European film and got the Oscar for the best foreign language movie, but did not survive well the time in my opinion. It is also a too much explicit and extrovert exercise in cinema art to my taste.The story has a level of ambiguity that cannot escape the viewer. Treating the period that immediately followed the second world war not in the black and white colors of victors and vanquished, of executioners and victims but as rather ambiguous times when people of both sides were fighting for survival in the aftermath of a catastrophic event that change the lives of nations and individuals forever is still a source of disputes even today, more such was novel and courageous two decades ago. Yet it is the means of expression that really do not appear fit to the task.The film seems to include a lot of quotes descending directly from the films of Hitchcock, especially his early films set in the prewar Europe, with brave British spies fighting evil German spies on trains crossing at high speed the continent at dark. The trains were a symbol of the world and its conflicts with all their intensity and dramatism. Here the train also becomes the symbol of the first sparkles of the rebirth of Germany after war, of its might, of its obsession with order and regulation, of punctuality and civility. The characters that populate the train are far from being the classical spy stories good or bad guys. The principal character a young American of German origin coming to postwar Europe willing to be part of a process of help and reconciliation finds himself in an ambiguous world of destruction and corruption, with liberators looking more like oppressive occupiers, with the vanquished not resigned to their fate but rather willing to continue on the path of selfdestruction, with love doubtfully mixed with treason.It is yet this classical film treatment that betrays the director in this case. The actions of the characters, especially of Leopold Kessler played by JeanMarc Barr seem confused, and lack credibility. The overall cinematography seems to be not Hitchcocklike but rather from a bad imitation of Hitchcock in the late 30s. The usage of color over the blackandwhite film used in the majority of the time in moments of emotional intensity is also too demonstrative. It is not that Van Trier does not master his artistic means, but he is too demonstrative, he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is. He really is great, as he will show in some of his later films, but it will be left to the viewers to decide this alone.","label":0},{"index":4722,"txt":"I saw the capsule comment said great acting.

She is done some good films, and i was hoping this would be just as good. as a matter of fact, she and this other blonde girl character the girl who got electrocuted i think were the only two out of the 811 actors who could act. this film has the worst acting i have ever seen. almost as bad as Psycho 1998. the really dumb part was when the woman was in the shower and marty rigged it to pour battery acid in there. she starts screaming, and her scream is probably the most annoying sound in the whole world. she attempts to get out, but accidentally falls back in. i will admit, the violence and story is good, along with harry manfredinis music, but the acting could have been a LOT better. there were two other characters, frank and joe. i do not know about you, but they bare a strange resemblance to dan akyroyd. also, when they find that womans fried corpse in the bathtub, you would think they would be screaming and barfing. No. Caroline Munro and the blonde woman are the only ones who react. Frank and Joe barely show any signs of fear or disgust. i do not know about you, but i know that if i saw a fried skeleton of one of my best friends, i would puke. also, when joe starts saying stuff like what happened to marty was an accident, it was not our fault. he says it like his nervous or scared but barely shows any facial expressions. then the blonde girl starts crying and says i am scared frank!. and she grabs joe. i guess the actress really did not know which guy was which. the films ending is the most confusing thing i ever saw. more confusing than the climax of jaws the revenge. all the eight friends end up dead, marty kills them all, but then, you see something that looks like him being chased by their rotted corpses, and then it just cuts to marty still in the hospital from the accident, and then when the film ends, marty dresses up as a nurse trying to sedate him, but then we see that marty has gotten into her clothes or somethin like that kills a doctor, and the film ends with marty peeling skin off his face. which leads me to this next question. WHAT WAS THE WRITER ON WHEN HE CAME UP WITH THAT?!?!?!?! did he actually expect people to understand just what the hell happened?? the ending left me so confused. were the characters still alive? is marty still holding a grudge? did the events we just see not happen yet or not at all? i do not know. overall, this movie was pretty dumb. the acting sucked, the music was okay, the story was pretty decent except for the ending. basically, this is just one of your average 80s teen slasher flicks. see it only for harry manfredini and caroline munro. 210P.S.

A prank goes out of hand leaving a geeky guy horribly burnt. A few years later the geeky guy returns and starts killing the people who hurt him. Now the story might sound intriguing and very entertaining, but what makes this horrible film so different from the rest of the 80s slasher flicks is that it has some humorless flaws and continuation errors.The acting is horrendous, however, actually not as bad as one would suspect. Though it does not help that every character in the film are so grody and unlikable. The lead, Carol Manning Caroline Munro is the easily the biggest tormentor of them all and she is the one that we are ostensibly supposed to share compassion and root for. Not to mention, the geeky guy is almost too geeky and I think that even stereotypical geeks themselves would be rudely maddened and just downright antagonized by how geeky he his, so when he gets mauled, does anyone really care? There is much unintentional laughter potential. Munros lack of acting talent is quite apparent, which puts her down at the same level as the rest of the awful cast. However, the most amusement is easily when the film poorly attempts to pose Munro, who is in her mid 30s at the time, as a teenager amongst a cast of teenagers. And then when it comes to later life and Munro is playing around her real age, the rest of the cast do not pass as adults. This all goes well with a theme song that is a hilariously pose of heavy metal thrash accompanied by maniacal laughter and a voice shrieking I will get you. With that being said, Slaughter High really is not a very good slasher flick, but it does have a bad cheesy entertainment value to it.

When they are punished for playing said prank, they follow up with a bigger prank which par for the course in slasher films involving pranks on class nerds goes ridiculously awry leaving Marty simultaneously burned by fire and disfigured by acid for the sake of being thorough. Fast forward five years, where we find members of the student body gathering at the now abandoned high school for their five year class reunion. We find out that it is no coincidence that everyone at the reunion belonged to the clique of pranksters from the flashback scene, as all of the attendees are being stalked and killed by a mysterious, jester maskclad murderer in increasingly complicated and mindnumbingly ludicrous fashions. It does not take Sherlock Holmes to solve the mystery of the killers identity, as it is revealed to be none other than a scarred Marty who has seemingly been using his nerd rage and high intellect to bend the laws of physics and engineering in order to rig the school for his revenge scenario. The film takes a turn for the bizarre as Marty finishes exacting his revenge on his former tormentors, only to be haunted by their ghosts. Marty is finally pushed fully over the edge and takes his own life. Finally, the film explodes in a crescendo of disjointed weirdness as the whole revenge scenario is revealed to be a dream in the first place as Marty wakes up in a hospital bed, breaks free of his restraints, stabs a nurse, and finally disfigures his own face.The script is tired and suffers from a terminal case of horror movie logic. The only originality comes from the mindnumbingly convoluted ways that the victims are dispatched. The absurd itwasalladream ending feels tacked on. It is almost as if someone pointed out the disjointed nature of the film and the writer decided then and there that it was a dream.Technically speaking, the film is atrocious. Some scenes were filmed so dark that I had to pause the film and play with the color on my television. The acting is subpar, even for slasher films. I cannot help but think that casting was a part of the problem as all of the actors look at least five years older than the characters they portray, which makes the flashback scene even more unintentionally laughable.

That there might be a connection between the presentday Asian drive for industrialization and wealth and earlier experiences of starvation and terror is never mentioned.At the same time, there is an effort to present Edward Burtynskys photographs of industrial waste as somehow beautiful.

Keira Knightly was not convincing as a tough chick at all,and I cannot believe Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid. The script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across a chalkboard. If you have not seen it,do not. You are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel .I have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults. This one is just a waste of time.","label":0},{"index":4740,"txt":"I am, as many are, a fan of Tony Scott films. When this movie came out I had high hopes that it would be like Man On Fire.

And the whole armscene was too gratuitous! The movie is centered around Kiera Kinghtly, and this movie reveals that she will never become a movie star!

I like some of Tony Scotts work, also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie, even though I heard otherwise from other people. But this was simply hopeless. In my humble opinion, Tony Scott was trying too hard. It was all just too much. Allow me to elaborate. Miss Knightley was overacting, and not in a good way. The people who did perform well, were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez, and Christopher Walken, but their screen time just was not able to save the movie. There were a few scenes that jumped out in their originality, yet somehow it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer. A certain tune was used around 4 times, which really started to bug after the second time. I am a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once. Also, the editing really went out on this one, as the cutting rate is rather high. Oh, and the repetitive echoing of some of Keiras lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second, third, fourth time, and so on. Basically, my opinion is that if you want to see an actionflick that is highpaced and somewhat funny, and you do not care about everything I mentioned above, you might like it. On a side note I am not a Keira Knightley fan.","label":0},{"index":4742,"txt":"What do you get when you mix a lump of clich\u00e9s with a directionless pacing and a group of characters who you do not care about and a failed attempt at creating an appealing visual style and an even bigger lump of clich\u00e9s and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget?

Avoid watching it at all costs.

Perhaps it was the overall glorification of being a bounty hunter; maybe it was the sexism masquerading as an involving and interesting study of a hard bodied female lead character; maybe it was the mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints or the manner in which it takes an actress like Lucy Lui; who deserves a lot better than this junk; and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light cannot directly hit with the same dumb look on her face. Maybe it is the editing; that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as they are uttered by people like Kiera Knightly who, if you buy as a bounty hunter, then you will probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in 2012.Nobody comes away from Domino with any sort credibility, absolutely nobody at all. It is a painful and misguided experience, taking inspiration from things like Natural Born Killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them. The principal question is Was Domino supposed to be some kind of comedy? what with its hilariously bad lead uttering certain lines that desperately want us to think she is coming across as tough but really, she resembles more an arrogant fifteen year old girl on her first day at public school, attempting to impress her peers. There are things you genuinely do not know how to react to, whether they are supposed to be funny or not. If it is supposed to be a comedy, that begs the next question Is the life of a bounty hunter really the sort worth exploiting for laughs? I do not think so.The film opens with the title card Based on a true story........sort of. If that is supposed to be some sort of postmodernist technique that enables director Tony Scott to bend and manipulate the story of Domino Harvey for his own unique purpose, then you are simply on another planet. Truth is, in that one opening quote the film identifies the subject matter and the original text before completely copping out and saying sort of which I guess is supposed to enable them to make Domino older than she should be and appear on Jerry Springer. Following this, we learn of Dominos relationship with her father who died in the film when when she was ten or something; here is the first use of the sort of cop out as in real life she was just four. But if the film had gone by realitys dates then her entire drive would have been born out of the death of........her goldfish.We are then thrust into action with Ed Mosbey Rourke; Domino Knightley herself and wouldbe love interest Choco Ram\u00edrez. During the scene, an American mother is pinned down via gunfire in her own caravan in the back end of nowhere as she pleads for her sons life to be spared. What a really misguided opening; presenting its three leads as nasty people who break into trailers, fire off weapons at innocents we do not know anything of and come close to shooting their pet dogs.The immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads, a feeling of No, why are you doing this? Why is this happening? Bad seeds are planted and, would not you know it, they stick. The film is painful to watch, excruciating even; as these three mug their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in Beverly Hills 90210. Here is another daft postmodernist slant, people playing themselves and that sort of Joker card being played again. Christopher Walken even pops up in a really stupid role that reeks of Robert Downey Jrs Natural Born Killers character.So as the film plods on and Domino is cast into Ed and Chocos gang, purely for her good looks I might add, it appears amidst the plot to do with fake drivers registration I.Ds or something that Choco and Domino may have feelings for one another. The problem is, as each performer is doing such a bad job in their respective character; there is no chemistry and no feeling between the two; the film is not a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place? Does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up? If there is any feeling between Choco and Domino, it exists on such a small, tiny, minimalist scale that you have to ask why it is even included.So then the film feels the need to crank things up narrativewise. We find out the reason for the fake I.Ds that are linked to someone else and a guy talks on a cell phone in a sound proof bubble. The sound proof bubble I can believe but how does he get his phone under the water and into the bubble in the first place without it becoming flooded? He must have swam really quickly \u0096 double the speed of the films fasted edit which means something in the region of .01 of a second. Yeah, sure. The films story becomes both too complicated and just plain arbitrary before resorting to a really dumb climax in which more stuff blows up. Plus, there is a really distasteful scene to do with a wall chart full of new ethnicities and the films comedy runs SO dry, that it has to resort to the Jerry, Jerry! chant whilst people are on a popular American talk show. When did we last laugh at Jerry! Jerry!? when we were, say, seven years old? I came away feeling sad and depressed at such a films existence.","label":0},{"index":4746,"txt":"Tony Scott has never been a very good director, but every film he is made after Crimson Tide seems to bring him one step closer to being the inarguable worst working today Michael Bay may fall into the same category, but at least his big, dumb, delusional epics entertain on some primally perverse level. And like other overblown Hollywood biopics DeLovely and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, for instance chronicling the lives of pretentious, overrated, or outright shallow ciphers given an aura of mystique by a society that thrives on the juicy behindthescenes details, Domino is a film that begins with little potential, and dashes that infinitesimal amount before the sixtyminute mark. With an alreadydistended running time of 128 minutes, the film feels twice as long, and spending time with characters this obnoxiously superficial and forgettable unlike the superior Rules of Attraction, Scotts attempts to tinge the proceedings with irony via Dominos smug, selfawarerichgirl voiceover only draws attention to the films sledgehammer cluelessness becomes an act only masochists could find pleasurable. The story? Spoileduppercrustbabe Domino Harvey Keira Knightley, in an ersatzbadass performance as shallow as her gorgeous looks is sick of the shallow lifestyles of the rich and famous in Los Angeles, and accosts gruff bounty hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez to learn a more exciting trade; along the way, there are doublecrosses, shootouts, media attention courtesy of a tongueincheek Christopher Walken, phoning in his trademark sleazebag, and laughable hints at romance. Scott cuts the film together in segments that rarely last more than a few seconds, cranking up the resolution to make the film a neondrenched nightmare that is frankly unpleasant to watchif Scotts given an opportunity to shakily frame an image, ghost it, or distort it in some way, he will; but all this tacky stylistic overload overwhelms what little plot, characterization, and suspense the film has to say nothing for its, ehm, entertainment value. Most of the characters come off as either contemptible or stereotypical, oftentimes both observe the unbearable, severalminute segment where an AfricanAmerican introduces a new list of racial categorizations on Jerry Springer, and I found myself wishing they would all get the tails end of our protagonists coin by the end. Domino is utter, unmitigated trashwhatever interest in this individual Scott hoped to inspire in his audience, it is lost in a sea of migraineinducing neon pretension a few minutes in.","label":0},{"index":4747,"txt":"I was very excited about this film when I first saw the previews.

In the 2nd Pirates movie when it came out I went to see it. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated her more for it. I think that had to do with her hair and having to cut it short for Domino.Domino who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still do not really know or care. I do not know who she was in real life or who she was in this film. I did not care about her character and even Keira getting partically naked did not make it worth the movie. The direction was definitely lacking. The writing was trite and shallow. The editing was horrible. I do not mind the style so much as the poor overuse of it. There is a place for it. Good examples of choppy, MTV style, colorful editing not sure if there is an official name would be Fight Club; just off the top of my head. Even Enemy of the State had a semi similar editing style at parts. It was used tastefully and was not used as a crutch. I mean this is the same guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide.

When the dialogue is not clich\u00e9d or banal, it is littered with laughable lines such as There are three kinds of people in this world the rich... the poor... and everyone else. At one point the bounty hunters have some guy tied up in the back of their bus who has a combination number tattooed on his arm. Because of a confusing mobile phone call, instead of rolling his sleeve up and just reading the number, they blow off his arm with a shotgun. At another point, the bounty hunters take a bomb to a meeting arranged with the mafia and threaten to set the bomb off unless the mafia let them go!? Clearly not going to the meeting would have been just too easy.Keira Knightley is unconvincing and dreadfully miscast.

It is absolutely distracting and without substance, which could be considered a good thing if you look at some of the quotes from the movie. I do not write many reviews here, but felt this movie was so awful that it deserved comment. Movies like this erode at Movie making as an Art form. Movies like this one show more and more clearly that the current Reality focus in cinema is revealing the quality of the characters behind them. People hone there craft, there 5 senses, and there business sense  overlooking there own inner life. However I do not put blame on them, it is more and more the unfortunate condition of this age  qualified by films like this one. But by proxy these Manufacturers I would dare not call Artists vomit there lack of inner life or regard onto the screen  diffusing it to everyone. A story of bounty hunters, guns guns and more guns, heavy handed flaunting of sex  for the oh so popular actress did they write the lap dance scene after they signed her?, over saturated, over exaggerated, one liners, nonlinear plots. All different and yet all the same. Annoying overwhelming music to push the emotion down your throat. A story? a development of character? or just withheld, missing information, revealed at the end to create the effect of a story  as if one took place. It altogether lacks anything remotely resembling subtlety. It is a caricature of stereotypes and genre. Where are the films with Awareness? What about subtlety of sound and music that you are not even aware is there? What about the depth of a look? What about editing with a point about mind and consciousness? yes even in action films this can happen. Sure they have honed a craft; but what use is it without soul or wisdom? of insight into the human condition? Can the people who commented and said that this is an apogee of art, or compare this to Picasso and others  I say put this next to Gandhi or the Godfather, even the original trilogy of star wars or the lord of the rings; then look me in the face and say it again.

WRONG. This conversation provides no coherent narrative whatsoever. Rather on the contrary, Dominos lesbian come on on Lucy Lius character during the second part of the movie just throws the audience into further confusion.Then i thought that maybe it is a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background who grew to be a tough bounty hunter. In any case, that is the message conveyed by the opening scenes. But after that the question of Dominos character is entirely lost to the criminal plot. So in short, NO this is NOT a movie about Dominos character.Then i thought, it is probably a story of one robbery. A pretty bloody robbery. 10 millions went missing, bounty hunters are chasing around suspected robbers, mafia kids are executed, hands are removed, Domino tries to crack why this time they get no bounty certificates, etc. But soon this impression is dispelled by another Uturn of the plot.This time we are confronted with a sad story of an obese AfroAmerican woman, who fakes drivers licenses at the local MVD and at the age of 28 happens to be a youngest grandmother. Lateesha stars on Jerry Springer show, tries to publicize some new, wacky racial theory, and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick granddaughter.What does this have to do with the main plot? URgh, well, nobody knows. Except that director had to explain the audiences where will bounty hunters put their collectors fee of 300,000.Then at some point you start to think Oh, it is about our society and the way media distorts things. There is reality TV crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent footage. The bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of Hollywood actors, who just whine all the time about having their noses broken and themselves dragged around too many crime scenes. But NO, this is not a movie about media, they just appear sporadically throughout the movie.Plus there are numerous other subplots the crazy Afghani guy bent on liberating Afghanistan, the love story between Domino and Chocco, the mescaline episode, the FBI surveillance operation...Can all of the things mentioned above be packed into 2 hrs movie?

Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS.For instance, Eds idea to have Edna make coffee for them after having shot off her sons arm is way below his alleged experience; it is just an extremely stupid idea. Domino not questioning the fragmentary orders she receives from Claremont Williams over a breakingup phone connection just eludes me; should not she be long suspicious that Williams is turning them in? Those FBI agents seem out of their minds showing up with just one single helicopter to something they have every reason to consider a capital mafia shootout. Besides, what they do by withholding and leaking information towards Cigliutti is pretty much incitement to murder; it seems to me like farewell to justice if that is they way the FBI does investigations. In reality, they would have a case messed up beyond repair if they acted like this. We get to see a car accident which normally would have at least seriously injured if not killed most of the passengers but miraculously leaves all of them with just a few bruises. Quite the contrary, the accident is immediately followed by Domino making love to Choco, which is from Dominos viewpoint in no way founded by previous events but just by being drugged to the eyeballs.The whole sequence of scenes starting from the phone call of Claremont Williams appears to me just as wanttobe dramatic razzledazzle.

Knightley plays her as an obnoxious, cynical brat who has done nothing to warrant our respect. She punches people she does not like and sheds her clothes and inhibitions when the situation calls for it, but she is not the least bit real and Knightly is not the least bit convincing, either.The film is boring. It is loud, too, and shackled with one of the most annoying source music scores I have heard in a long time.

This is not an artistically brave or experimental piece; it is a failure on every level because it gives us no entry point to the lives and dilemmas of its characters.Mickey Roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter, but he disappears into the background as the narrative progresses.

First of all there are two actors that look like LL Cool J who work in an auto shop in Toronto the Mecca of racial diversity, but still have time to practice dancing for eight hours a day. There are a few other guys in this crew, including a token white dude and a guy that looks like Denzel Washington in Malcolm X. There are also two women in the movie  one resembles Serena Williams and the other looks like Geraldine from the old Flip Wilson Show. One of these ladies was kicked out of a private college because her parents spent all of her tuition on a drugaddicted sibling. The other girl, a member of Salt N Pepa, no doubt, is just plain no good.There is another guy who looks like Eddie Murphys Buckwheat, while still another actor who is a Huggy Bear knockoff. These guys are rival step dancers. Evidently, this activity is very hardcore in the hood, and they are all practicing for the big Step Monster jam in Detroit.Since I was unable to understand 90 percent of the dialogue perhaps some subtitles would have been useful, as in a Bergman film or that one music video by Snow, it is hard to explain what happens, other than there is a lot of arguing, the Serena Williams girl who never smiles, by the way becomes a freelance stepper moving from group to group, there is some stepdancing and a lot of irritating hiphop music.It is a typical ragstoriches story; sort of like Rocky with a really bad soundtrack, Rudy with annoying rap music in the background, Cry Freedom without the laughs.

On a positive note, the directing was pretty good and cinematography was pretty decent as well. Looks like the production budget was very generous as well. My only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find actual screenwriters to help them bring words alive on film.

You may be asking yourself, how could a movie about Santa Clause scare anyone? The plot of the movie revolves around Satan sending one his minions, Pitch, to earth in an attempt to kill Santa and ruin Christmas. That is right, Satan sends a demon up from hell to kill Santa Clause. Pitch stalks Santa throughout Christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on Christmas day, for if Santa does not make it back to his home in space, he turns to powder.

It is laughable to say the least, with bad effects, even for 1959 standards. If a kid were to watch this movie, he would have nightmares and never want Santa to visit. They would be scarred for life.

It is got terrible sets and effects, and features a rather frightening Santa who does not operate at the North Pole, but instead from a cloud in outer space, and who does not have little elves helping him make his toys but rather all different groups of children from practically every country there is. The opening sequence, where St. Nick chuckles heartily as he observes monitors showing all these kiddies working hard while singing terrible holiday songs in a variety of languages, seems to go on forever, and with no story. Obviously, THIS Santa Claus does not observe the child labor laws!Eventually we get some nasty and slinky redsuited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to Earth, just to make little kids naughty and turn Santas Christmas Eve rounds into a nightmare. Watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience, and it is bound to frighten little children and turn them off Santa Claus and the holidays forever. Oddly, the name of Jesus Christ is mentioned often in this Christmas film, which somehow makes it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on.

Gordon Murray. Judging by those two efforts already mentioned, Cardona was no visionary \u0096 and, this one having already received its share of flak over here, is certainly no better! The film, in fact, is quite redolent of the weirdness which characterized Mexican horror outings from the era, but given an added dimension by virtue of the garish color which, in view of the prominence of reds \u0096 apart from St. Nick himself, the Devil plays a major role in the proceedings \u0096 throughout, was essential. Anyway, in a nutshell, the plot involves Satans efforts to stall Santa Claus Christmas Eve rendezvous with the Earths children; there is, however, plenty more wackiness along the way to begin with, our portly, whitebearded and chronically merry maninred lives in a celestial palace who, apart from accompanying toymaker kids from all over the world on his piano as they sing laboriously for the whole first reel! in their native tongue, visits Merlin \u0096 the famed magician at King Arthurs court, here bafflingly but amusingly prone to childlike hopping and mumbling gibberish! \u0096 once every year to acquire potions which would bring somnolence to the young and render himself invisible by the way, the Wizards anachronistic presence here is no less unlikely than his being a cohort of Dr. Frankenstein in SON OF Dracula 1974!!; incidentally, by this time, he always seems to have gained some excess weight\u0085so Santa has to work out in order to be able to fit into each proverbial chimney! The Devils antics enthusiastically rubbing his hands together at every turn and generally hamming it up to hold up St. Nicks delivery program, then, is perfectly puerile indeed, their titfortat shenanigans resemble an old Laurel  Hardy routine more than anything! To pad out the runningtime, we focus on three sets of children one, the lonely son of a rich couple who wants nothing more for Christmas than their company projected as a wishfulfillment fantasy where the boy finds his parents wrapped in extralarge packages!, a girl from a poor family who yearns to own a doll of her own the horned one first tempts her to steal one, then invades the little ones dreams \u0096 to no avail and a trio of brats who, egged on once again by Satan, think of nothing but causing mischief and eventually fall out amongst themselves. There is definitely imagination at work here, but it is applied with little rhyme or reason, while the overall juvenile approach keeps entertainment unless one counts the film as a guilty pleasure well at bay!","label":0},{"index":4780,"txt":"This Santa movie starts off strange and I think Santa might be a pedo. Instead of the usual elf toy makers, this Santa has apparently kidnapped kids from all across the globe and makes them sing a bit like characters from It is a Small World! I guess there are no child labor laws on the weird astral plane on which he lives it is apparently NOT the North Pole and not on Earth!! None of these kids seem very happy and I kept wanting to see commandos break in and rescue the tykes, though I guess for some of the third world kids, these working conditions were perhaps an improvement over local sweatshops. I sure hope that all they do is sing and make toys.Then, the scene abruptly changes to Hell where lots and lots of demons dance about like they are in a Busby Berkeley musical. This fun in put to a stop by Satan who orders one of them, Pitch, to go to Earth to ruin Christmas!! Personally, I thought this movie already did that! The Devil and his imps are actually kind of cutelike Hot Stuff from the Harvey Comics but with cool evil goatees! Or, if you are Puerto Rican, like a vejigante mask with a goatee! Somehow a povertystricken Mexican kid named Lupita, a group of jerky kids who want to mug Santa and some rich kid are key battlegrounds for the Devil and Santa!! So, if the Prince of Darkness not Donald Trump, it is the OTHER Prince of Darkness can somehow make her steal and be bad, he will winwhat, we do not really know! In fact, as they root her on, you get the impression that the film makers intend Santa to be Jesusas he has all these great powers AND fights the Devil over kids souls! Later, Santa meets with his friend, Merlin. He asks him to make him a special powder that makes people dream nice dreams. Considering how much Santa laughs in the film like a demented chipmunk, I assume he must use this drug A LOT! He immediately goes to see a blacksmith who makes him a magic key that opens ALL doors. Considering he keeps kids as his personal assistants, this magic key thing worries me immensely! During Santas Christmas Eve ride, you see Lupita behave like a little angelone problem down. Santa then takes time out now to take care of the rich kid whose parents are selfish jerks. He gives them some sort of crazy cocktail which magically solves their problemstwo problems solved. This is a rare case where alcoholdrugs HELP kids and solves problems! And as for the little muggers, he gives them coal! Frustrated with his losses to Santa, Pitch then tries to steal the sleigh which is pulled by creepy animatronic deer. When this fails, he destroys Santas stash of magic powder! As a result, Santa cannot become invisible to avoid dogs and gets treed. Uh, oh...how can Santa take a detour to the Betty Ford Clinic if he is stuck up a tree?! Will St. Nick get down from the tree and get the monkey off his back or will the devils win? If you care, tune in and see. However, be warned that the film is batcrap crazy! Technically speaking, the film is yecchy. While it is in color, it is really gaudy. The music is mostly done on an organwhich, along with bad singing from the kids, produces perhaps the worst soundtrack I have heard in recent memory.

Santas jolly hohoho is replaces by an evil, devilish laugh that I am sure has turned many kids off of Christmas. The plot of this massacre is very strange, which fits along with all of the performances and dialog. Santa lives high above Earth in the North Pole where he, and kids from all around the world get ready for Christmas. But Santa has an enemy named Pitch, or Satan. Pitch tries to ruin Santas Christmas by making three boys naughty, and by creating diversions, like moving the chimney and making the doorknob hot. When Pitch causes Santa to be attacked by a dog, it is up to Santas helper Pedro and Merlin the wizard to get Santa out of this pickle. Everything about this film, along with being downright bad, is so bizarre. Satan dances a lot and he actually seems much more merry than Santa. Santa talks about delivering presents to all the boys and girls, yet he seems to only deliver to 5 houses of kids in Mexico. The reindeer are wind up toys, and when the reindeer laughs, I am amazed it does not bring tears to kids eyes...it is frightening. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes are simply Santa playing the organ while kids sing to it. Probably one of the strangest scenes is Santa shooting Pitch in the butt with a minicannon and uproariously laughing about it while Pitch dances around in pain.

They just were not very good. The same production company made an even more disturbing version of Little Red Riding Hood in which the wolfs obsession with our heroine has unmistakable hints of pedophilia. Perhaps this was the inspiration for Freeway. Back to Santa Claus instead of the North Pole, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas resides in a satellite in geosynchronous earth orbit shades of MST3K; instead of elves his toys are made by children chosen from around the world; and he had sophisticated spy equipment to check just which kids are naughty and nice. The result is like an Orwellian outer space sweat shop. It is enough to turn you off Christmas forever. This and other lowrent Mexican childrens films were dubbed in English and widely distributed in the U.S. in the early 1960s; no wonder the sixties became such a turbulent period in American history.

All that she wants is a doll for Christmas, but he parents cannot afford to buy her onethey spent all of their money on the cardboard that they built their house out of. So Pitch tries to encourage her to steal a doll. In reality, that is the only way that a girl that poor would ever get a doll, because being saintly and praying to God and holy Santa does not really work. But Lupe resists temptation and tells Pitch to get thee behind her, and so is rewarded by being given a doll so creepy looking that you just know that it is Chuckys sister.Along the way Pitch manages to get Santa stuck in a treeuhhuh from whence he is rescued by Merlin! Merlin? You have got to be kidding me! Since when do mythical Druidic figures appear in Christmas tales, or have anything to do with a Christian religion? And does not God disapprove of magic?

Some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious. Like when Vigo was standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his Dream Quest. His Indian pal was standing next to him. Vigo was only wearing his white briefs. I am sorry  it just looked silly  him surveying the vista in his Fruit of the Looms. Another scene was at the end  after the explosive crash into the bulldosers  the announcer said that the impact was clocked at 180 mph. Then he mentions that the cops said his remains were not found because he vaporized, but some people believe he bailed out and was hidden by friends in the crowd. Then it shows him rolling out of the car at 180 mph! First of all, you could not open the car door at 180 mph. Secondly, the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 yds. with nobody to steer it. It would promptly roll over about 30 times. Thirdly, if you hit the pavement at 180 mph, you would wind up in various squishy pieces. No matter, we see him at the end standing with his daughter.

In this remake, all the countercultural elements have been stripped away, and been rendered more PC in an attempt to reach a broader audience, presumably. Sanitized for your Protection Inserting the American Indian scenes was gratuitous, and the idea of a noble purpose to the trip was subtraction by addition.

The major government involvement was farfetched. There is no flow from one scene to the next. In the original you could go get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up. It only took a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car. It takes many times longer than that in real life. Car guys notice this stuff. Also, the fool or fools that chose to trash a 1968 Charger and abuse a 1970 Challenger should be shot in the heel with a dull bullet. The fact they are not car people is painfully obvious, and their passing will not be grieved. The actors lacked any emotion, everything was cut and dried. One step above a monotone. A barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic.Last but surely not least, the radio DJ made the statement that the Challenger hit the bulldozers at 180 or 185 ??. That is total garbage.

He was a man trying to drive from Denver to San Fransisco to win a bet. Why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of uppers? We are not really sure.We had a few flashbacks that gave us the picture that he was an adrenaline junkie, and presumably he had led his entire life trying to make it to the vanishing point. That point you see off in the distance where the left and right shoulders of the road come together, and the road itself vanishes. He lives only to be free, and means no ill on anyone. We saw several times when there were accidents he stopped to make sure the other driver was okay before moving on, even the cops that were chasing him.When he saw the futility of his quest he took his life rather than be arrested and live a life of captivity. He died like he lived, running wide open.In the remake Kowalski has a whole history including a first name, even. He is trying to get to the hospital where his wife is suffering from complications to her pregnancy. He is a devoted husband, and excited expectant father. He comes to the decision to take his life after hearing his wife died in delivery, but they even leave THAT in question when they suggest that he may have jumped out of the car before it ran into the bulldozers.

Hagars defiance for the sake of defiance was not there. Bram could have been a lot more crude than portrayed, and Hagars father could have been played more traditionally, so to speak. If the filmmaker would insisted on stronger portrayals, the film would drive the point straight to home.Along the same vein, why should we see cell phones, organic produce, and other modernizations? Are we trying make some points for the sake of making some points e.g., the Muslim girlfriend and the Native people. Hagar and co. are everything but politically correct in the book, so why should we see that in the film version. Modernization may be an excuse for a lowbudget operation, but using that as an excuse to send subliminal politicallycorrect messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel and the film seems like throwing punches below the intellect.There is also the audience. It seems that we have been conditioned to see bitter old people as cute and lovable. Why should be laugh every time Hagar is at her tantrums? I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted her readers to laugh at, or with, Hagar. These people are frustrated and are full of angst, and all we do is to laugh at them.

But this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous a test of machismo, for example, is illustrated by two guys who battle in the front yard with garden tools, the writing is so forced such as the oftdescribed scene of a gremlin hanging on the arm of one girl who would notice it, if only she turned her head a quarter to the left... and this is not the first time in the movie this happens, and the story is so... rarely given attention hence the MST3K riff about a law in the future where films have to be made by FILMmakers, that you actually root for the furry puppets to kill off everyone on screen. Worst movie... ever.","label":0},{"index":4828,"txt":"For starters, Hobgoblins tries to ape the more successful Gremlins. That is bad enough but they do not even try to make anything that closely resembles a movie here. Instead, it is more like a bargain basement, everythingmustgo clearance of embarrassing scenes, inappropriate sound FX, acting as bland as unflavored tapioca and a script that takes everything humans hold sacred in their motion pictures and throws em down the old tubearoo.The plot? Grrrr.... Meddling kids track down gremlinlike creatures from movie lot before they kill people by projecting their fantasies. Sound cool, does it? Well, see that wall on the other side of your room? Run right at it, top speed, face first. See, THAT is cooler than this movie.You dare to doubt? Quick, name something else one of the leads has been in other than this. What other scripts have the writers done since Hobgoblins? Name another Rick Sloane directoral effort. How many Hobgoblins action figures do you have? See?

I would rather write about more important things; like the separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, that kind of thing.

It ends up a sleazy waste of time, where bad actors deliver bad dialogue in front of an idiot director, who occasionally tosses stuffed toys at them. They wrestle with said toys in much the same manner as old Tarzan films used to use rubber crocodiles, shaking them whilst screaming and trying their best to make it look slightly threatening. It is painful to watch, and not helped by the mental 80s fashions worn by the cast.Basically, some crazy little aliens who have been trapped by an aging security guard in a film lot finally get free after umpteen years confinement, and begin to telepathically screw around with peoples minds. The guards new recruit, the idiot who let them out despite repeated warnings, gets his gang of 80s friends together and they go off and have minor adventures together while trying to recapture the Grem... Hobgoblins.All life is here, with the gang consisting of a knucklehead jock, his 80s slut girlfriend, the heros frigid and prissy girlfriend, and the young hero, lacking in confidence and wishing his girlfriend would put out anyway.First off comes the infamous rake fighting scene, where the exmilitary jock shows how he was trained in the army to be a bully, poking the nerdy hero with the wrong end of a rake for what seems like hours. Then there is some running around, terminating in a real piefight style ending in a scuzzy nightclub with comedy handgrenades blowing up everything except the people standing right next to them. Then the film sorta ends, and alls well that ends well.It is not. This is like watching a train wreck, you cant take your eyes off it, it is so bad. Perfect fare for Mystery Science Theater, but godawful should you try to watch it alone and uncut. The Fashion Police still have a number of outstanding warrants for the cast, and I dare anyone not to laugh in outright derision at the rake fight.

Even for a B grade movie, all other cheap horror movies on the same platform completely dwarf this movie in terms of plot, acting, and goodness.It begins with a random old security guard and the younger punky security guard whose name is of no importance. Why? Because a few minutes into the film he walks into the forbidden safe, and is killed whilst living out his fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pub.This is just an appetizer for the scatfilled main course. The main character, KEVIN, struggles various times to prove himself as more than a total pussy. Perhaps he succeeds within the film, but to the audience he proves himself as nothing more than a bad actor. Kevin gets himself a job with the old security guard, and is guided through his security shift in the wait for it abandoned studio lot. Yes why bother making a set when you can just use the studio itself. Back to the film. Kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the Hobgoblins. The Hobgoblins force people to live out their wildest fantasies and then kill them for some reason. They must be returned before sunrise or else...or else what? Exactly.Other characters include Kevins macho army friend NICK, Nicks woman DAPHNE whose character has no more substance than a bitchslut attitude and prostitute worthy outfits. There is Kevins manipulative and reserved girlfriend AMY, whose deepest desire is apparently to be a badly portrayed Cher lookalike with fishnet stockings with a pair of blue grandma underpants on top.. Do not ask me how that works. Quite possibly the most entertaining character of all is KYLE. How such groups of friends are made is up for question. Kyle is a perverted creep who cannot go an hour without selfstimulating. His hobbies include calling up sexchat lines from other peoples houses and most likely sniffing underwear.The story unfolds as the heroes search for the Hobgoblins kneehigh creatures aka. hand puppets which, for some reason, attempt to travel no further than the borders of the local neighborhood. Each of the characters eventually lives out their wildest fantasy which never has anything to do with having millions of dollars... or the film having a big budget.WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD The twist at the end of this movie will leave the watcher wondering What?. The Hobgoblins are returned to the safe by...their own free will. Perhaps they lost patience waiting for sunrise to wreak havoc, or perhaps the storywriters got writers cramp and decided not to worry about the ending. Upon returning to the safe, the old security guard reveals What he learned in the military and detonates explosives which destroys the safe, signaling the end of the evil Hobgoblins and the end of this roller coaster ride; better fitted to a ride on an escalator.The sheer badness of this film is enough to send someone to tears.

As mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a Gremlins type movie. This however has the worst looking monsters of that genre. Critters looked pretty good, so did the Ghoulies, heck even the puppets from the Munchies looked better than these. The characters in this film are thouroughly unlikable. The hero is a whiney security guard, his girlfriend is always complaining, they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend, and another friend who is a spaz. At one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with rakes...this movie is just utterly stupid. I like the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum which is obviously not a club, but more likely a diner and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21.

It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It took an act of will to sit through the whole thing, and I would sooner spill my own blood than have to sit through it again.What is wrong with it? Let me tell you the story of my trip to go see it in the theater.I went to a midnight show, on a Saturday night. I the only ones in the theater were myself, and a bunch of loud, boisterous, rather unruly teenagers, sitting somewhere behind me. They were obviously out having a good time on a Saturday night, and had come to this comedy for some laughs. Before the movie starts, during the previews, they were laughing and joking and making loud comments having a grand old time. It was borderline annoying; had they continued their unbridled enthusiasm into the actual movie, I might have said something, but I was feeling tolerant and empathetic of their spirited fun, so I let it go. And they did settle down once the movie started.Why am I telling you all this? Because you can judge this alleged comedy by the effect it had not just on myself, but on this rowdy bunch.During the entire run of the film, not one person in the theater laughed. Not once. Not myself, not the boisterous kids. Absolute silence, aside from the soundtrack. And when the film was over and the lights came on, we all, all of us, slowly filed out of the theater in slow, somber, absolute silence. It could have been a funeral.This was the effect that this comedy produced. Not laughter, not enjoyment, but absolute DEPRESSION. It was a depressing, depressing movie, and not the tiniest bit funny. Preachy, selfindulgent, depressing, but not funny.I consider Mel Brooks Blazing Saddles to be on the short list for Funniest Movie Ever.

The acting was alright but again there was not anything to work with. The movie is about A storyteller who reads a good book by a dying kid. However insert spooky here no one can verify the kids existence. So Williams goes to Wisconsin to try and find the author, however all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boys caretaker.

The movie runs a little over 0130 and within the first 15 minutes, or so it seems, Noon begins his search for Pete Logande, the boy caller.This happens after he talks to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times. The conversations are not too indepth mostly consisting of how are you... I am in the hospital...why did you boyfriend move out... etc. In the book, the kid almost becomes Noons shrink and vice versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy, once he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he might be a hoax.In the movie, Noon becomes obsessed with finding Logande, but the audience is left to wonder why? Since there really is not a strong enough bond established between Noon and the caller, why bother? Who cares if the caller does not exist? I know there is a difference between a book and a movie, but those calls and that relationship was critical to establish on screen, because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie.

The Night Listener is an interesting story, which is great in building up the suspense throughout the movie and you are pretty much kept in the dark of who is lying and what is real.

Her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very uncanny and I hope to see her win an Oscar hell, I think she might pull off getting a Best Supporting Actress nod for this one if the script were a little better. The film starts off as a psychological thriller, but a predictable one at that. If your curious to know the films ending and twists, then see the film otherwise I would rent another predictable thriller called Hide and Seek.","label":0},{"index":4859,"txt":"Felt mine was while watching this...but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film. Not that makes a lot of sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloffs last films and it is only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all. It is sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this. Marginally, Boris did get off slightly better than poor old Bela Lugosi but not by much. Boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together. The strident background music does not help and distracts from any lucid moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, clipped, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies. At a guess I think it is Edgar Allen Poes House of Usher that this is taken from but you would be hard pressed to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.Still, there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of the shrinking brain too!","label":0},{"index":4860,"txt":"House Of Evil aka Dance Of Death of 1968 is the first of four infamous and odd last movies starring the great Boris Karloff and directed by Jack Hill and Juan Ib\u00e1nez. Unlike Snake People 1971, The Incredible Invasion also 1971 and The Fear Chamber 1972 which were all released after Karloffs death in 1969, House Of Evil was released in 1968, when Karloff was still alive. House Of Evil is regarded by many as the worst of these four movies, which are without doubt all rather crappy, but definitely have their entertainment value as the unintentional comedies they are. I personally prefer The Fear Chamber and House Of Evil over the other two, simply for the reason that the lack of the slightest logic is even more extreme, and since there is no suspense whatsoever in any of the movies, the lack of logic increases the unintentional fun factor.The odd story I do not know if I can really call it a plot is set somewhere in Europe in the 19th century. After some girls are murdered and found with their eyes ripped out, Mathias Morteval Karloff, an enthusiastic organ player, invites his few remaining relatives to his bizarre mansion, which is full of eerie toys. His kinfolk includes Lucy Durant Julissa, who is engaged to one of the police inspectors investigating the murders.I will not give away more of the story, but I can assure you that it is quite bizarre throughout the movie. There are some very funny moments, especially some things Karloffs character says. Boris Karloff was without any doubt one of the most brilliant and important icons of the Horror genre who ever lived, and he manages to award this odd movie with a tiny bit of his greatness, and although or because his role is due to a poor script and and directing in no way scary, it looks like he deliberately plays it with a sense of humor. Just like in the movies successors Snake People and The Fear Chamber, the female lead is once again played by Julissa. Most of he supporting performances are hilariously amateurish, the cinematography is terrible and the locations and sceneries are beneath contempt. The storyline lacks the least bit of logic and the dialogue often does not make the slightest sense. It is the poor story and dialogue, however, that makes this movie so entertaining to watch. House Of Evil may be an extremely crappy attempt of a movie, but it is certainly as unintentionally funny as it is bad. Fans of Ed Woods movies should be very amused, I personally found it hilarious. Crappy but entertaining nevertheless, and definitely worth watching since there is Boris Karloff in it and due to the fun factor. 310","label":0},{"index":4861,"txt":"Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a dying, lonely old nut who lives in Morhenge Mansion with some servants and tells his doctor friend, Do not try to doctor me, doctor!

The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in On Deadly Ground as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder. I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat . The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephews grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage. The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear. What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie. My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing.

It is up to Matt to save the day  the whole planet...Written  directed by Kevin VanHook, who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the start, I personally thought The Fallen Ones was a terrible film  it is as simple  straight forward as that. There are so many things that are just plain bad about The Fallen Ones both on a technical  conceptual level, the script does not make a whole lot of sense  it does not really get going until the final 20 odd minutes by which time I had almost lost the will to live. The characters are awful  as clich\u00e9d as you like, the dialogue is bad as in very, very bad  the entire film is predictable, I mean it is not going to come as a surprise that Casper Van Dien is going to save the day is it? It is not a huge surprise that the mummified giant is going to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of comatose state. This is bad, very bad. You have been warned.Director VanHook does not impress, the fight scenes are absolutely awful  why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple? They look naff. To give it a bit of credit the special effects on the giant Mummy itself are actually good although there is not that many of them since he does not make an appearance for over an hour, there are also some normal sized Mummys that look to have come straight from the set of The Mummy 1999, unfortunately these are not used to any great effect  in fact are wasted as some comic relief. The mechanical Mummy was a pretty good idea but looked silly  there is no way on Earth that all those people inside could work in sync with each other to operate it, actually the more I think about the more ridiculous the idea is. Forget about any scares, tension or atmosphere  do not even think about any gore or violence because there is not any.Technically The Fallen Ones is not anything special  apart from the impressive giant Mummy effects there is little her to get excited about. The ghost CGI  water effects are terrible, it was madeforTV  it is shows. The acting was poor, Wagner looks embarrassed  this is probably the only thing the likes of Dien  Bosley can get these days.The Fallen Ones is a bad film, there is no two ways about it as far as I am concerned.

I believe he tried his best, but script just stunk. Music tried to be kinda Jones style too. Great work, but for such movie it seemed like too much work, like the video part didt deserve all that great music. Robert Wagner gave his best acting skills, he did a good job, but somehow the script was bringing everything down. Jokes are old school, somewhere 20 years old; they brought only cynic smile to my face. There are some really bad camera angels, SFX looks like homemade and unrealistic.

Second, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot girl falls in love with guy, ship they are on sinks, lots of crappy love scenes thereafter.

The battle between nature and technology always caught mans imagination. The latest film concerning this tragedy in the Atlantic Ocean was written and directed by famous action movie filmmaker James Cameron. The story of Titanic involves two fictional characters Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet from different backgrounds one is a hoboartist, the other is an aristocrat and how their love triumphs over societal barriers and the tragedy of a sinking ship that they happen to be on.First of all, although using a historical name, this movie had little regard to history. The plot was built around two fictional lovers, French diamond, and treasure hunters. The deaths of over a thousand of people on the greatest luxury ship of its time became a mere background. Many historical facts were simply forgotten. Where was the radio operator that ignored the iceberg warnings? Why was there no mention of the ship that was only 5 miles away from the Titanic but did not come to the rescue because its captain failed to identify the distress signal? Omitting these facts is an insult to the tragedy. And what was the point of flavoring this historical disaster with fictional cheesy romance when the story is already as sad as it is.The overall plot was rather shallow; rich equals greed and corruption, poverty equals compassion and heroism. It is very ironic to spend 200 million to make a movie about how money corrupts. There was absolutely no human side shown in antiheroes. It seemed like Billy Zane was playing a part of the devil. Casting was also very poor. If DiCaprio was 2 inches shorter than Winslet, you could swear she was his babysitter. The length of the movie was unnecessarily stretched to over 3 hours. First hour and the half was wasted on establishing the relationships between the characters that were known to audience long before they went to theater and the dialogue that was used to do so made it even worse. Hearing corny pick up lines such as I see you and This is my side of the ship generated more pain than the screams of drowning people. Also, jokes were too abundant and rather lame.Titanic did involve some moving scenes such as the part when the musicians were playing while the ship was sinking but they were no way near anything original. The best thing about this film were its special effects, and that is the only thing that truly deserved an award.Although this film lacked artistical value in overall sense, the public could not resist a sentimental story starring Romeo DiCaprio, and so the movie became a success.

In addition, for an English woman, Miss Taylor does not even seem to try using an accent.The film begins with Peter Finch and Taylor meeting and marrying in England. Their plan is to return to Finchs tea plantation in Ceylon Sri Lanka and at first it seems like a good life. However, there are no women to talk with and the household staff seem to resent her. On top of that, once back home, Finch behaves like a boorish jerk and Taylor is miserable. Neighbor Andrews can see this and he declares his undying passion for her. However, Taylor is not yet ready to abandon her marriage. But, through the course of the film Finch treats Liz more and more like an object and finally she is ready to leave...when out of the blue, Cholera strikes the plantation. So it is up to Andrews, Finch and Taylor to work together to save the daythough by this point I really did not care, as there is absolutely no chemistry between the characters, the dialog is pretty dull and you cannot understand why Taylor did not leave her weasel husband within days of arriving in this inhospitable hell.The film is not particularly engaging or convincing and despite a decent budget by Paramount, the film is a sluggish mess. I particularly was surprised that although the film appeared to be filmed on location, many scenes were clearly filmed in a studio with a rear projected and grainy shot that was not integrated well. In one scene, for instance, Taylor, Finch and the lot are sitting on the veranda and the grass is bright green. Then, when the picture cuts to people dancing right in front of them, the grass is brown! It is clear they really are NOT in Ceylon in this scene or the scene with the giant reclining Buddha. My advice is to skip this one or at least keep a pot of coffee nearby to keep you awake. Despite its budget, it is just not a very good or inspired film.By the way, could Miss Taylor have been pregnant during part of this film? In some scenes particularly at the beginning she is wearing billowy clothes, has a doublechin and looks puffy. This is not a criticismafter all, women do get pregnant! But if you look carefully, you will see what I mean.Also by the way, the basic plot in many ways is similar to GIANTa great Taylor film indeed! It is amazing how casting and decent direction can do so much.","label":0},{"index":4886,"txt":"Essentially a story of man versus nature, this film has beautiful cinematography, the lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor but the film really never gets going. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the plantations foreman, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the spell of owner Peter Finchs late father whose ghost casts a pall over Elephant Walk that becomes a major point of contention between Taylor and Finch. The elephants are determined to reclaim their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their rightofway. The beasts go on a rampage and provides the best moments of action in the picture. Taylor and Andrews have some good moments as she struggles to remain a faithful wife in spite of he marital difficulties with Finch.","label":0},{"index":4887,"txt":"Being an independent filmmaker and a huge fan of Edward D.

The story is completely unbelievable of course, and did not succeed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register. The choice of the principal actresses was awful. While Paul Rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy, the taste in ladies of his character seems to need serious improvement as Eva Longoria seems too aged sorry for him, and Lake Bell seems too unattractive sorry again. A romantic story without good enough reason for romance is due to failure from start. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually better but they had only supporting roles.

Cary Grant was an angel in The Bishops Wife 1947. Of course the best were the Topper movies in the late 30searly 40s. And, more recently, Warren Beattys Heaven Can Wait 1978, which was a remake of 1941s Here Comes Mr. Jordan. These were wellwritten, funny, entertaining comedies, all of which centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels.Now comes writerdirector Jeff Lowell, making his feature film debut with a story of an unlikable, bitchy young woman, Kate Eva Longoria Parker, who gets killed on her wedding day and then comes back to harass the fledgling spiritualist, Ashley Lake Bell who is falling for Kates fianc\u00e9, Henry Paul Rudd. One thing that is clear at the outset Longoria Parker is no Constance Bennett Marion Kerby in the first two Topper films, who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are measured.There is a line right at the beginning when Henrys sister, Chloe Lindsay Sloane tells Henry, You do not smile. That aptly described my situation throughout this film.The main problem with the film is that the script just is not very funny. But it is made worse by Longoria Parkers presence that just rubbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen. Just to start out with, compounding her lack of comedic talent, she is covered with so much pancake makeup, who knows what she really looks like? Kate gets killed while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue. She is so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is about walks out on her well, she actually just fades out, so Kate finds herself back on earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is.Chloe wants Henry to snap out of the funk into which he has naturally descended after Kates death from what I saw of Kate, he should have felt a wonderful relief, so she introduces him to Ashley, who really does not know what she is doing as a spiritualist she is also a cateress to make ends meet, to see if she can get Henry back in touch with Kate. There is a lot of meshugaas that goes on.The vacuity of the film is epitomized by a B story revolving around Ashleys assistant, Dan Jason Biggs. This is thrown in near the end, but the way Ashley handles it indicates that she is as much of a boob as Kate. Since Dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely flawed women, he deserves whatever he gets.Eventually Kate appears to Ashley and the fun should begin. It does not, and mores the pity because in other hands this could have been pretty funny. As it is, Norman Z.

The only way in which it might have worked is if the writer had simply gone crazy with it and turned it into a noholdsbarred satirical farce. Instead, wanting to ensure that he delivered a fuzzy, inoffensive and warmhearted romantic comedy, Lowell engages in boring halfmeasures every step of the way, tamping down the absurdity in favor of drab conventionality. Indeed, Over Her Dead Body is so thoroughly inept and unfunny that it is hard to know where exactly Lowell thought he was going with it. Virtually every setup, joke and sight gag in the film is flatfooted and poorly executed, with even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their predicament. How else to explain the halfhearted, lifeless performances of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles?

I think I may have found it to be a little better without her, just she does annoy me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat likable. But you have to admit, there was no point to this movie, it was one of those quick paychecks for the actor type of thing. The movie could have been funnier if someone had really paid attention to it and had a better cast.Henry just lost his bride to be, Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day. But when his sister takes him to a psychic, Ashley, Henry falls for her, but Kate is haunting her from beyond the grave. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to move on so quickly and she will make sure that Ashley does not get him by torturing her day and night with her rambles, believe me, with Kates voice, that is scary.Over Her Dead Body is an alright movie, not sure if it is worth the money, but I would give it a rental for you if you want to see it or are curious. Eva Longoria just does not have enough star power to make the film work, no offense to those who love her, she just belongs on the small screen over the silver screen. Not to mention the character of Ashley, she seems still not too likable with everything she pulls, or her gay friend, Dan, just again, not really likable. Just with some rewriting and proper attention, this film could have been better, but instead we get the average predictable romantic comedy that will leave with with an empty feeling.410","label":0},{"index":4919,"txt":"With movies like this you know you are going to get the usual jokes concerning ghosts. Eva as a ghost is pretty funny. And the other actors also do a good job. It is the direction and the story that is lacking. That could have been overlooked had the jokes worked better. The problem only is that there are not many jokes. Sure I laughed a couple of times. Apart from the talking parrot there was not an ounce of creativity to be noticed in the movie. I blame the director not using the premise to it is full potential. Eva certainly has the comedic skill to show more but did not get the opportunity to do so.

Quickly though the movie becomes a mess with uninteresting plotlines, characters that are never fleshed out and nobody in the audience cared for like Marjoke and terrible editing. The movie has fade to black bits that are just way too long, a messed up chronology that jumps back and forth and lots of scenes that just do not add anything to the story and could easily have been dropped. After suffering through the story you will get treated to one of the worst endings I have seen in a very long. It should also be mentioned that the movie has lots of explicit sex scenes which you are probably used to if you watch a lot of dutch movies. It is hard to mention any good things about this movie.

They remark on the female leads resemblance to Elaine from Seinfeld None of them are spongeworthy and riff nonstop on Bakers weight.

And I even liked Baker in Mitchell, because he was playing an antihero who was SUPPOSED to be unlikeable. Yes, MST3Ks coverage was hilarious, but they took a lot of cheap shots at Baker  that he did not deserve  to keep things lively and entertaining  he was appropriate to the level and tone of the movie, and he was the best part of the movie.Final Justice seems to be more of the same, but in spite of the exotic locations and the cowboy frontier justice theme, it is quite a bit weaker than Mitchell. And the main reason is that Bakers character, as written, is an idiot. The movie has the conceit that because Baker embodies old style frontier machismo, he challenges his opponents to old style manoamano quickdraw contests. And because he is so tough and macho, he always wins, even when he is hurt, wounded, outnumbered, etc.That is a conceit with a lot of potential it worked for Gary Cooper, even if it condemns the film to B movie status. But Baker is so frigging stupid and obsessive that he needlessly challenges three of the bad guys henchman to a showdown in a public market, with civilians all over the place. He COULD have simply shadowed them to the chief bad guys headquarters which was why he was following them in the first place and they never would have noticed. Or he could have gotten the drop on them and forced them to surrender, and gotten one of the henchmen to take him to headquarters at gun point. But no, he has to be a bush league hot dog and a macho blockhead, and so he gets a child taken as a hostage in the ensuing shootout! This is a guy we are supposed to admire? The whole movie is basically like this. Most of the supporting actors are somewhere between OK the henchmen to pretty good the chief bad guy and his father, who are two well known European actors  they just go through the motions, but they are pros and even hamming it up they are decent. But through it all, Bakers character pulls silly , unproductive stunts and mistakes that get at least two relatively innocent people killed, plus a couple of bad guys who might have been taken alive without the use of deadly force.On the positive side, since 90 of the movie is set on Malta or in the Mediterranean, you get to see lots of pretty scenery and lots of nice and exotic looking extras. And really, Baker himself may be on the heavy side and slightly dyspeptic, but he is not that bad...certainly not the tub o lard that this films critics including Mike and the Bots in their hilarious coverage seem to think.In short, this movie is good for video wallpaper, but the viewer should not pay any attention to it.","label":0},{"index":4939,"txt":"The only words you need fear more than Joe Don Baker if your thinking of watching a film are Greydon Clark , and if they are both there , run for your life .

Let me get this out right up front, I have seen Final Justice both with and without the Mystery Science Theater 3000 commentary. I have seen the scenes that were cut that help make the movie a more coherent whole. And I have seen the cutup TV version that was used for MST3K. Having said that, I have got to admit that I much prefer the MST3K version. Why? Because Final Justice is one lousy movie. The MST3K commentary helps make it much more palatable. On its own, it is a real snoozer of an action movie with corny dialogue often delivered with such thick Italian accents that it is impossible to understand, bad acting, weak direction, gigantic plot holes, and most everything else you will find in a bad movie. And if most of Final Justice was not so bad, it is good, it would be one terribly dull movie on top of everything else. So, yes, I enjoy the often very funny MST3K commentary over the bad movie on its own.My main sticking points with the MST3K commentary and with most of the reviews I have read on Final Justice, however, involve the criticisms of Joe Don Baker. The main weaknesses in Bakers performance actually have nothing to do with his size or the wardrobe choices of his character or any of the other jokes flung in his direction. Instead, I think much of it is has to do with the poor decision to cast him in the lead in the first place. Joe Don Baker has always struck me as a decent enough actor, but he is not the kind of guy I would call an action hero by any stretch of the imagination. He is more of a sidekick as he demonstrated with solid performances in a couple of James Bond movies. Or if you really want to blame someone for the problems with Final Justice, point your finger at director Greydon Clark. Clarks resume cannot begin to compare with Bakers. So I say, Lay off Joe Don Baker!","label":0},{"index":4941,"txt":"In short, the movie had a little bit of a weak 1st act with some forced acting and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and pacing, somewhat of a decent 2nd act that managed to build some tension and intrigue despite some inconsistent pacing and some inferior performances by the cast, and the 3rd act ... there virtually was not ANY 3rd act!Regarding the 3rd act, the movie just abruptly ends. There is no resolution and no path down from the climax of the 2nd act, so there was not much of a 3rd act. The bad guys die and that is that; the end credits roll. There is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and the supporting characters and so on. The audience would have likely left the theater after the movie, asking that is it? A real letdown.Music was composed by David Bell which worked adequately enough to serve the film most of the time, but it is certainly nothing outstanding. It is just functional, but achieves this by being merely generic and derivative. It is also apparent that the score is VERY dated with the use of synthesized timpani for some of the percussion. What least impressed me about the score is that some moments of tension heralds music cues sounding like they were ripped off of James Horner from 48 HRS. and Commando, particularly the brass.In all, the film had potential as the basic story itself is good, but the execution was lackluster with mediocre direction, weak acting, and somewhat inconsistent pacing.There was virtually no 3rd act to properly finish the story, and this omission is major and unforgivable as it does not allow the movie to end satisfactorily. This could either be the screenplay or, possibly, the production had to cut out filming or editing the 3rd act into the finished movie due to budget constraints but I am speculating as to why there is not a 3rd act. Whatever the reason, the abrupt ending really hurts the movie overall. This is good for a view if you are curious and you can get the movie for VERY cheap as well as to learn the reason WHY you need to have the 3 acts beginning, middle, end if you write screenplays and make movies.Otherwise, you might not want to waste your time unless you can get the MST3K version to at least get some laughs out of it.","label":0},{"index":4942,"txt":"Joe Don Baker.

That is fair enough that is, after all, how it got its widest exposure, but, having had the misfortune of seeing Final Justice in its original form, I would just like to share a few thoughts and comments on the uncut version.First off, it must be admitted that the original version is slightly more coherent than the MST3K broadcast, owing primarily to an expository scene between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini I COULD use the characters names instead of the actors, but I just love typing the words Venantino Venantini, explaining why Venantinis fugitive character cannot just leave Malta right away. It is not a very CONVINCING plot point, but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it. Whether this scene was cut just for time or because it did not provide much fodder for riffs, I do not know.Another plot point missing in the original The strippers betrayal of Venantino Venantini to Joe Don Baker, seemingly unmotivated in the MST3K version, is explained by an earlier, extremely unpleasant scene in which Venantini rapes her in the shower. While this does give her a motive for turning against him, the whole scenario is just really...icky. There is no other word for it.Some of the MSTworthy moments the perpetual truncated shouts of Son of a and the deja vu shooting of the sheriff were purely the result of the editedforTV print they worked with, and were absent from the original movie.One scene I wish had made it into the MST3K version Before entering the bar to question some people, Joe Don asks the Maltese policewoman accompanying him to stay outside, because they see that uniform, they will not cooperate. However, Joe Don himself is wearing his ridiculous cowboyslashsheriff outfit, complete with shiny badge! I cannot imagine why they passed on that great opportunity to make fun of him...One final observation on the original, uncut version of Final Justice Why, oh why, did they feel the need to put Venantino Venantinis naked butt up on the screen?","label":0},{"index":4951,"txt":"I was excited to hear that Cesar Montano had decided to make a movie in the Cebuano language. Not dialect as most Filipinos will incorrectly refer to it as. As Cebuano and Tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as French and Spanish are to each other. But I was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie. Being a Canadian, of Cebuano parents, I was optimistic about the revival of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this film. I was further excited to hear that it was not another stupid action movie or melodrama as Filipinos love these types of movies. But alas, I was shortchanged.Panaghoy serves as an ego trip for Cesar Montano. Montano of course plays the hero of the movie. And when I say hero I mean in the most stereotypical of manners; his function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the Bolanons to victory against the Japanese. His character has no depth or complexity. He just fits the hero mold. The rest of the characters are one dimensional; they all fit their cookie cutter roles.I am all for slowmovingmeditative movies but this movie was just slow moving. It did not really meditate on anything. Just because a movie is historicallythemed, a drama and slowmoving does not make it a wellmade film.Particularly annoying is the American actor Philip Anthony. His performance was embarrassing.If Montano wanted to revive the Visayan film industry he should have really thought this through. He said he wanted to make Visayan movies that could compete at Cannes and Toronto etc. but really, this movie would have been booed and hissed at at such festivals. To get Visayan films into the mainstream consciousness he should have at least made a movie that would have attracted audiences, even if it meant sacrificing quality. Obviously he did not think about or get information on what kind of movies garner awards at Cannes so an audienceattracting movie would have been at least a foot in the door.I am afraid now that Visayan movies will not be made for a long time again because of this movie. If ever I said to a Filipino that I want to see more Visayan movies of course I would get an answer like, Visayans do not make good movies. Did not you see Panaghoy Sa Suba? Of course this is ludicrous as it is one example of a Visayan movie and probably the only example that anyone nowadays would be likely to see.An example of movies that are meditative, not just slow moving, are the Tagalog film Blackout or David Lynchs The Straight Story. I hate to promote the Tagalog language as it is endlessly and unfairly promoted and shoved down the throats of nonTagalog Filipinos but for the sake of calling a spade a spade I say that Blackout is a VERY good movie. These movies rely heavily on what Hitchcock called pure cinema. Images without words are used to convey the story. But I bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two movies in that these movies use images without words to convey the mood of the movie. and they do it very well. Panaghoy thinks that if they simply take sweeping shots of the landscape then they have established the mood.And what is with so many Filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother???","label":0},{"index":4952,"txt":"Oh my GOD this was so bad!

The voices also did not suit the characters, and once you hear the voice of a beloved character, the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned.

Aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence, the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980s cartoon based on a line of action figures. The bad guy himself even talks like a Skeletor wannabe, has the obligatory inept henchman, and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon. Just do not expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue. At other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai, yet there is no sex, no tentacle rape Thank goodness! and very little sex appeal, this despite the physical appearance of the title character. There is simply no adult edge to this material, unless you count the halfnaked heroine and bloody deaths.

Other critiques will better describe this movies fecal nature, and I felt ohsobad at the poor guy from the production company who had turned up, obviously to gauge the audiences reaction. What he got was the sci fi equivalent of a drunken student audience, and after a serious anime movie, I think it was sky blue, the audience was in a sombre mood, and then this movie opened and within seconds everyone in the room was rolling in the isles. I will bullet point the worst parts;Script The funniest, and worst part of this movie, it clunks along a linear and predictable road with the occasional illthoughtout aside. Rubbish, but eminently laughable.Animation Poorly done, and put together, if you can put up with drab backgrounds and gradually skimpier costumes for the heroine I know I can!, then watch out for the montage where she trasforms from a Swedish peasant girl into LADY DEATH!!!Characters So onedimensional its painful, there is a brief backstory with sidesplitting lines of dialogue and little light is shone on the actual motivation behind some of the main characters.So, in a nutshell, if you have got a captive audience and a few beverages lying around try and make sure they are alcoholic to ease the pain, then slip this movie into the DVD and get in a mystery science theatre 3000 mindset. There is no other motivation to watch this movie other than to laugh at it, and its not meant to be a comedy. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE ALONE.

The plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points pretty much stop there. The characters do not have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series. The movie only covers a small portion of the comic, and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts. The focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic book.With the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing. Sadly, it was not that way, so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love. My copy will surely collect dust for years until I finally throw it out.","label":0},{"index":4959,"txt":"Well, I can honestly say that this is the first time that I experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it. The entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course. The story line was fallible and laughable, the characters were onedimensional, the realism was out the window, and the animation was done by fouryear olds. Does that cover it? I have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life. I have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character, but from the looks of the other reviews I am not off base with my observation.To begin, the story moved too quickly. For someone new to this character and situations, I needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution. I have seen other Anime if you could call this one an Anime that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them. There was nothing set aside for Lady Death. In a few short scenes, we see her train with Cremator and instantly become this aggressive shebeast of Hell. This was hard for me to swallow, considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father. Suddenly, she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years. This was absurd. The presentation of Lady Death was poor, to say the least. I felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind. For me, it just did not work. She was nothing more than eyecandy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with Cremator. Oh, I felt sick just watching her. The same goes for the character of Cremator. Who was this random person? The explanation they gave was not enough, and instead I was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development. It is a very sad day in Hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action, especially in an animated feature.Next, there was Lucifer himself. Let me just say that I think I could do battle with the King of Hell and survive. He was weak, his voice was laughable, and he just did not represent the image that I had in my mind. It was as if Disney was in control and wanted to make him semiPC. He lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that Lucifer embodies. He was not the ruler of Hell, but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live. Speaking of living or dying, how can you die again in Hell? That was a concept that definitely needed more explanation. Most of the characters were worrying about dying, when they did not even consider the option that they were already dead. That is how they got to Hell. I think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me. I did not quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in Hell, but that could just be me \u0085 or maybe it was because there was NO DEVELOPMENT in this story. There was nothing built, just preparing.The battle sequences were hysterically bad. The animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early 90s. There was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn. Why are we, America, so behind on animation? It is huge in Asia, and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like Lady Death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination. We are cheap, and this film shows it.Overall, this film was bad. The animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap. I had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time, which is hard to understand because I think I could have made this film on my credit card. The production was horrendous as well as the story. Nothing was developed, leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into. The strength of the characters was missing, and nothing was explained. I wasted my time with this one and would like to warn others so that when Death does come, you do not find yourself in my state and regretting the fact that you wasted 80 minutes on this piece of garbage.BLAH!

It is true that everyone has his own preferences, but you can trust me on this movie. I will be objective. To begin with the story  it is OK. Follows the story line of the comic books as far as I am familiar with them. But the animation... Well, it is not actually terrible, but it is definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be a lot better if they did not try to imitate the anime style and sticked to the original comic book style drawings. If we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightnings you could tell that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more. Looks a little bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985. Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for instance  4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better! In addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable, the music is nothing special. So all in all  it lacks atmosphere. I watched it, but I cannot tell I really enjoyed it. It just does not capture you. There is plenty of blood and violence, but that does not impress me at all. May be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time is there anyone around?, but I do not think this is the audience for this movie. So they could add a little nudity and spice to it. The chicks around Lucifer were quite tasty, and hell, we have Lady Death herself! There are few sexy looks, but that is not enough. Instead of Bill Browns music I think it would look better on a hard rock  heavy metal soundtrack.

Butterfly wings? One could ask what all of these words best describe, and some those in fuse with the international film community may quickly say Happenstance, but others may jump aboard the more American train and immediately yell, The Butterfly Effect. Strangely, I would be one of those screaming for that scifi Kutcher film mainly because none of those words that I initially mentioned at the start of this paragraph accurately depicts the Tautou feature that I witnessed. Sure, we all loved her in Amelie and thought she was the daughter of Jesus in The Da Vinci Code, but in this film firsttime director of a feature film at least Laurent Firode does not give Tautou the opportunity to shine. Sadly, he gives nobody the opportunity to really demonstrate themselves because he is too delicately caught up in the moments of random chance to bring this film to anything but just a shimmer never a true boil. Firode has ample, and I use ample as a small word, moments throughout this film where he could have built us a fantastical story, a genuinely whimsical fairytale of love and coincidence, but instead he fell facefirst into a mudbucket of chaotic intertwining that overwhelmed us with inconsistent characters and a story that left us gasping for less.Tautous beautiful face adorns the cover of this box, but do not be so taken immediately as I did in assuming that this was going to be another monumental journey into Tautous French cinema. Tautou is in this film, do not get me wrong, but one could argue that she is not at the center of this story. Firodes job is to create a series of random events that eventually will lead to an audience friendly albeit confusing ending which exemplifies that meaning of refreshing melodrama. He utterly, utterly fails. Firode fails by giving us, the audience, too many characters. With too many characters he gives us too many random interventions, and by the end you do not really care who is who, or what is what, or how is how; your main focus happens to be centered solely on the ending credits and the time destination of their arrival. Tautou could have saved this film from the disaster it was if only Firode would have given her the center. Alas, he did not, but attempted to seemingly force a group of 12 through a theoretical film hole about the size of a penny. It just did not work and we were left with a jam in which we were completely stuck.Firode fails because he focus so intently on the minor details that, for one of those rare film occurrences, he actually forgets the central focus. I can say that there was no defined central focus to Happenstance. In the beginning he attempts to create one with our two supposed main characters discovering that they share the same birthday and their horoscope promises love by the moonlight, but we never go back to that throughout the film. Instead, again, we are bombarded with new characters, stuffy scenes, and meaningless drivel obviously chosen to direct us away from an actual story and more into a world full of ifs, ands, and buts. I could not do it. I could not believe this film. Writer Firode yes, the same guy directing this garbage uses a technique so primitive in this film that I immediately felt like ending it immediately. He must have been assuming that many of us were incapable of actually following the storyline or the scientific premise because he grabs the aid of a homeless person to actually fill in the respective blanks. I did not need this, nor do I think Firode needed to belittle his audience in this matter. While there were other elements that just did not seem to work for me at all again, felt like a jumbled Parisian collage of shredded paper, this was the icing on the cake. I do not need my hand held through films.I will give this film one star for credit. This is a rather difficult genre to master successfully. Time travel films are especially hard because of the innumerable amounts of possibilities that are never accounted for, but with Happenstance it works because Firode semiexplores the different avenues. While I will counter with saying that he does not do it well, it did make for at least five full minutes of enjoyment. I liked where Firode was headed with this film, he had a genuinely diagramed story, but the final execution just blew this film to shreds. Firode could have saved this film if he would have strengthened his characters, while lightening up his premise and story. I think my overall mood of this film would have changed if just these two simple directions were taken. Oh, how I only wish I could time travel back to the production of this film to show Firode the errors of his ways.Overall, for the first time and probably last, this was a Tautou film that I must say utterly disappointed me. From the choppy opening to the apathetic ending, I just felt that Happenstance failed due to Firodes leadership and horrid marketing. Marketing is something that I did not mention before, but why would anyone purchase this film thinking that it was an Amelie 2 per the title released in Hong Kong, and why would you place Tautou squarely on the cover knowing full well that she was not carrying this film at all. I believe that from the first minute that passed on my DVD player, this film was in shambles. While I will applaud his subject, everything else was well below the level of mediocrity.

It would have been very nice if there had been an English translation in the last scene when a dying Fanny speaks to Morris.Jan Kadar, who successfully directed Miss Kaminska in her Oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966s The Shop on Main Street directs this film as well. Kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really does not convey the desperate situation that she faces. She keeps calling for Ruthie, their daughter, who disobeyed them by marrying out of the Jewish religion. For most of the film, she does not realize the Angels appearance in her apartment.The scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the Angels girl friend confronts Belafonte in their apartment, is memorable but all too brief.We do not know why Belafonte is in danger and why he has died.Those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation.","label":0},{"index":4970,"txt":"LOL! Not a bad way to start it. I thought this was original, but then I discovered it was a clone of the 1976 remake of KING KONG. I never saw KING KONG until I was 15. I saw this film when I was 9.

At the same time this film remains a holy grail of Bmovies. Memorable quotes Take a tranquilizer and go to bed. Put the Yeti in your tank and you have Yeti power. I remember seeing this film on MOVIE MACRABE hosted by Elvira. There is one scene where it was like KING KONG in reverse! In KING KONG he grabs the girl and climbs up the building, but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl who was falling! Also around that year was another KONG clone MIGHTY PEKING MAN 1977 which came from Hong Kong. There is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts. This film will leave you laughing. It is like I said, just another KING KONG clone.

A short lived japanese TVshow, that got cancelled after a psychopath admitted to being inspired in the killing of a young schoolgirl by the show. This short in the series is, like all the other films in the series, practically without any story. A group of guys have captured a young woman. They tie her down and proceeds to torturing her to death while videofilming her. They beat her, pour boiling oil over her, use pliers on her and finally, in loving closeup, push a needle through her eye. This is the most straightforward of all the Guinea Pig movies, and one of the first. It was probably this film, more than any of the others, that gave Guinea Pig the rumour of being snuff. They certainly gave inspiration to Nicolas Cages movie 8 mm.. These movies have gotten quite popular in horror circles. They have progressed to more polished, but equally graphic movies like Naked Blood. They probably fill the void left by the Mondo movies, that got slightly cleaned up and became reality TV.

However, I do think that there should be at least some point to the violence. This piece of crap does not have any point whatsoever. The first film in the notorious Guinea Pig series, The Devils Experiment 1985 is widely controversial, but, as opposed to many other controversial films, this stinker has nothing at all to be recommended for. I must say that, before seeing any of the GunieaPig films, I already had a feeling that I would hate this one, knowing what it was about. Due to its status as one of the most controversial films around, however, I decided I had to see it. I am very glad I did not waste any money on this pile of crap, and I sure wish I had not wasted my time with it either.This things story I do not even want to call it a film It does not have one. Three scumbags torture a woman to death for some excruciating 40 minutes. That is it. There is no artistic value, no shocking story, no suspense; nothing. Simply the disbelief that a film that shows NOTHING except for a woman being tortured for no reason enjoys an enormous cultfollowing. It IS disturbing, I give it that. Of course it is disturbing to watch a torture video for 40 minutes. What is more disturbing, however, is the fact that many people actually seem to regard this pile of garbage as some kind of masterpiece. I really cannot figure why. The fact that the gore effects look realistic cannot be the reason, I hope. The girl who plays the victim is not a very good actor, and reacts very calm to all the torture. That makes the film look less realistic, which is, in this single case, a good thing. This is a film that is sickening; not for its gore, but for its redundancy, its existence for the sole purpose of showing 40 minutes of torture.I strongly oppose any form of censorship. Since this is 100 fake and nobody got hurt during its production, it IS legitimate to make such a film. However, I cannot think of a single reason why anyone would like this, other than the morbid desire to watch suffering and the enjoyment of torture. This films sequel Flowers of Flesh and Blood gained notoriety when actor Charlie Sheen mistook it for an actual snuff film and informed the FBI. Fortuneately, the film turned out to be fake. Overall, The Devils Experiment is a fake torturesnuff film that seems to have the sole purpose of looking as close to a real snuff film as possible.The Devils Experiment is one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through.

I saw it for the first time recently and could not understand what was supposed to be so great about it.The movie is about a female psychologist named Margaret who is also a bestselling author. Margaret has become disillusioned by her profession and her inability to really help anyone. She tries to rectify this by helping settle her patients gambling debt to a shark named Mike played by Joe Mantegna, who is the only reason to watch this film. She discovers that Mike is actually a professional confidence man when she nearly falls victim to a scam he pulls immediately after meeting her. Intrigued, she returns to see him and asks him to show her how con artists operate she plans on using this as the subject of a new psychology book. She then falls for him and accompanies him on a long con that he and his associates have set up.I do not feel like going into details, but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were an elaborate con by Mike and his cronies to swindle Margaret out of 80,000.First of all, the big twist towards the end was VERY predictable. Any scene where the con men were operating was made very obvious by the stagey acting and weird line reads. Not only that, but the audience and the main character knows that they are dealing with con men, so is it really such a big surprise when we find out that Margaret has herself been conned? Besides, Margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who is an expert at reading people, yet she allows herself to be duped far too easily  and keep in mind, she knows full well that Mike is a con artist.Secondly, we are led to believe that Margaret was conned from the very beginning, yet in order for the con to ultimately work, she had to do several things that the con men could not possibly have predicted that she would do. First, she had to decide to help settle her patients debt, allowing her to meet the con men in the first place. If she had not done this, the entire con would have failed. I just have to say that it is pretty unreasonable to assume that a psychologist is going to take it upon herself to settle a patients gambling debt. Not only that, but what are the odds that the con men would be at the right spot on the very night she decided to show up? Did they simply show up at that bar every night, hoping she would come and see them? Another thing that had to happen that could not have been predicted is that Margaret had to return to see Mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade. What are the odds of this happening? And yet the whole con is based on this premise.Another problem I had is with the ending. Margaret finds out she is been conned and decides to get revenge on Mike. At first, Mamet leads us to believe that she is going to con the con, but that falls through, so the ultimate ending is her gunning Mike down in an airport baggage area. Somehow that just felt like a clumsy and inept way to end a movie about con artists plying their trade. Not only that, but she did not even take back the money he stole from her.Ultimately, the movie leaves you feeling empty and unfulfilled. And if you, like me, predicted ahead of time that Margaret was going to be conned, you will find this revelation just as unsatisfying.","label":0},{"index":4995,"txt":"The plot of House of Games is the strongest thing about it a successful author and psychologist is conned by a gang of grifters, but in discovering the wicked part of herself that enjoys the thrill of what they do, she finally gets her revenge. That is about the pitch but someone has to take responsibility for it coming across as being acted by puppets. It has to be the director Mamet Lindsay Crouse has had a varied and pretty steady TV and film career, so she cannot perform this badly all the time. She is supposed to go from uptight, cool, controlled professional to calculating, wicked fast lady having fun, as shown by the change from beige trouser suit which she seems to wear for three days straight, including underwear to floppy floral sundress. But everyone seems to be speaking their lines the same clipped, precise way; I imagine Mamet wanting to make sure not a syllable of his scintillating script got missed. The effect is unsettling and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and suspense he is presumably trying to create. At times House of Games loses any connection to how human beings actually behave or talk, and becomes just a mechanism to spin out the plot. The clunky vibesnoboe fauxjazz soundtrack does not help either. The ultimate result is that the only entertainment to be had is in guessing the outcome, and the sooner you do that the sooner you will get bored with the robotic, twodimensional performances. And they smoke too much!!!","label":0},{"index":4996,"txt":"I was seriously looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed truly promising from the coming attractions Jim Carrey with Godlike powers was an idea that most definitely worked for me. As a huge fan, I was sure he would be supremely in his element with such a promising premise, and what could go wrong? Yesterday, my bubble got burst bigtime, boys and girls, because I saw the movie. The first act where it is set up that he hates his life, he is a disgruntled employee and a majorly unhappy camper with an ax to grind against God is serviceable, the second act where he is summoned by God via telephone and receives Powers Almighty is GREAT  Carrey gets to have fun with his new toys and it is a pleasure to watch, really funny. But the third act is wretched beyond belief.The rot starts setting in after the dinner scene between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace Jennifer Aniston, who comes off EXCEEDINGLY well in this movie considering her part is merely a plot device; even her NAME reeks of unsubtlety  she thinks he is gonna pop the question but instead, he tells her on bended knee, yet that he is finally getting his news anchor job, and is not it so exciting?She does not think so. She wants him to marry her, see, so she winds up leaving him, see, even though she still LOVES him very much, see, and the rest of the film is spent banging us over the head with one pathetic, beyondheavyhanded spiritualsounding cliche after the next, until by the end I was praying, too. . .for it to be over. I did not mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts one example  in the 2nd act, after he gets his powers, Bruce prances into the room singing What if God were one of us, just a slob like one of us, blah blah blah, and I was even willing to overlook the amazing amount of contradictions being hurled at us for openers, Morgan Freeman  aka GOD  tells Bruce he cannot violate anyones free will but he does this, a lot. Those choices were forgivable  this is a Jim Carrey comedy, directed by Tom Shadyac  it aint The Remains of the Day. Or rather it was SUPPOSED to be a comedy. When the script writers lose track of that in the dreaded act 3 and try to turn the proceedings into some sort of gag Message Movie, what we get instead is hell on earth. Bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways, he realizes that GRACE is his saving  have to say it  grace, and that his priorities in life had been severely misconstrued. All this could have been conveyed in a far less heavyhanded way, however. The film did not have to go into the dumper to make these points. Unfortunately, the writers and Shadyac apparently had no idea how to resolve the story in any sort of clever, lighthanded way, so they went the bangemovertheheads route in hopes that we would not notice. They even tacked some surprisingly unfunny outtakes at the end, in the further hope that this would lessen the bad taste. It did not work for me.","label":0},{"index":4997,"txt":"Why did I go to see this film? Honestly, because Jim Carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter, so do you really blame me for expecting that again? Additionally, the premise, the funny trailer, his costar Jennifer Anistons involvement, and the fact it was a massive hit stateside encouraged me.However, as my one line Summary suggests, I was Disappointed. For various reasons;Reason 1 It was not funny. In a 2hour movie, I laughed for about 510minutes...all together, the rest of the time I sat thinking I really should have got some icecream. I admit that maybe it is wrong to judge Jim Carrey on his previous films, but what does he really expect when he makes Gems such as The Truman Show , Liar Liar , Me, Myself and Irene , Dumb and Dumber , The Mask, and the Ace Ventura films then produces, in Bruce Nolans own words, such a mediocre film?Reason 2 Jennifer Anistons role was criminally underwritten. I mean hello! She is been around in the public eye for about ten years now, and in this film she gets about four lines to say. Wrong.Reason 3 One word  Clich\u00e9Reason 4 A casual deployment of specifically American References  Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite sweeps week  is a clue to the films specifically homegrown appeal. A teenager says no to drugs and yes to an Education  that is a miracle! Want to see a miracle soon? Be the miracle! God tells Bruce, a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the US, but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety. Additionally, I still go to school, and that statement suggests me and all of my friends are miracles...or maybe it just means we have brains?In this film there are enough funny Carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a total calamity, but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards.","label":0},{"index":4998,"txt":"Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today. With his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can just go crazy, and we love him for it. He has the ability to make mediocre comedies ala Ace Ventura, and turn them into decent comedic outings. Or, in the case of Liar Liar, make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around. Carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas. He was excellent in both Man on the Moon and The Truman Show. The guy is remarkable.Then comes Bruce Almighty, an ideal vehicle for Carrey, and a premise that should have worked; Carrey, after complaining about God and how his life stinks, is enabled with Gods powers. However, the script is pure recycled garbage. Now, no matter how bad a script is, Carreys improvisation alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny. The problem is that there are very few opportunities for Carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects, only some of which are amusing. Carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to work around the special effects. The writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny, because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving Carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely humorless. He seems more like a 5year yearning for our attention, wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny, when it is really just annoying.I have always enjoyed Jennifer Aniston on Friends and she was superb in last years The Good Girl. She too has a gift for comedy, but with the script as linear as it is, she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend. She comes across as nagging, grumpy, and there is no chemistry between the two stars.Bruce Almighty should have been a comedy that works. But it does not even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that it is making fun of; religion. A few minor giggles his internet is Yehweh, but instead it is just turned into a comedic superpower comedy. Not to mention that it is tone shifts from silly to heavyhanded, and even black comedy at times. The movie fails on nearly every level. That is not to see it is entirely devoid of laughs, but it is close. Any movie that feels the need to incorporate scenes of a dog peeing to get it is laughs has problems. But hey, if you find pee jokes funny, go for it.","label":0},{"index":4999,"txt":"Worst mistake of my life.I picked this movie up at Target for 5 because I figured, Hey, it is Sandler I can get some cheap laughs. I was wrong, completely wrong. Midway through the film all three of my friends were asleep and I was still suffering. Worst plot, Worst script, Worst movie I have ever seen. I wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour, then I would stop, and you know why? Because it felt damn good. Upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it burn....and that felt better than anything else I have ever done. It took American Psycho, Army of Darkness, and Kill Bill just to get over that crap. I HATE YOU SANDLER FOR ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WITH THIS AND RUINING A WHOLE DAY OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","label":0}]}
