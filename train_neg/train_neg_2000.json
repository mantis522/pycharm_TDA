This is the most boring and unnecessary thing I have ever seen. It is like Voodoo Academy takes the genres of horror, zombie, and gay movies, puts them in a grinder, then runs them through a coffee filteronly instead of it being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans, it is the kind that takes out everything vital, edgy, or in any way interesting.

He said in it that he wanted to emphasize physical comedy here so much that even if you had the volume turned off you would be laughing at this movie. Obviously that must be the secret. I had the volume turned up. I was actually listening to this thing and thought it was a disaster, and completely unfunny  a major disappointment after Schneiders hilarious performance in Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo.The story is stupid Mange is a major loser who dreams of being a cop who gets filled with a bunch of animal transplants after a car accident by a mad scientist type appropriately named Dr. Wilder Michael Caton, and as a result starts to lose control of his animal instincts. This makes him a supercop. He can sniff out drugs hidden in body cavities and outrun horses. Of course, he also has a nasty habit of eating peoples cows and trying to seduce their goats, but surely that is a small price to pay? It just did not do anything for me. The cast left much to be desired. Is there a more irritating actor in all of Hollywood than John McGinley? Here, he plays Sgt. Sisk, Manges commander on the police force, as a repugnantly cartoonish character much the same as his doctor character in the inexplicably popular TV series Scrubs. I was anxious to get a look at Colleen Haskells first serious acting job can anything in this movie be called serious? She, of course, gained her fame as a contestant on the first Survivor and she proves here what we knew from that she is cute as a button. What she does not prove here is that she has any discernible talent as an actress. And what is with Ed Asner as Police Chief Wilson. I mean, how old is this guy now? He is the size of some of the cows Mange tried to eat, and he seemed out of breath the whole way through. I am surprised he made it through the filming. There is a brief cameo at the end by Adam Sandler who also served as Executive Producer of this.Anyway, I chuckled twice Mange playing with his squeaky toys in the police car, and the scene Schneider has with Haskell and the orangutan  the orangutan has more acting talent!

How she could, as mentioned at the end of the movie, never marry just because of this infatuation was beyond me. I mentioned the Germans were portrayed as idiots and that was exemplified in the chase into the marsh. Several hundred German troops advanced, pushing the Russians into the marsh. So the Russians hid and the Germans stopped at the edge of the marsh and just stood there listening. I suppose they did not want to get their boots wet, but I am sure an officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men into the water to search the marsh. But that would have ended the story. Also, the Germans entered the barn where the Russians were hiding in the loft and did not bother to fire into the roof.

Let us be honest, when you sit down to watch something called The DoubleD Avenger you are not expecting great art or even mild mainstream entertainment. You are probably expecting a cult film type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts. You do not get really either of these in the video. The story, as it consistent with most of these types, is inane Kitten Natividad runs a local pub, finds out she has breast cancer, flies down to South America for a fruit that claims to be a panacea for any ills and a superhuman abilities giver, returns and fights, dressed as the DoubleD Avenger, a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition. As stories go, I have seen a lot worse, but as another reviewer noted the execution is horrendous. The action sequences lack zip, drive, motivation, and are tissue thin. The acting is not even properly campy and the dialog is the pits. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING is funny from the wincing puns to the heavyhanded boob references. All could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it, but they all fall way short. Kitten, Haji, and Raven de la Croix are all quite olderstill lovely in their own ways yet expose nothing and become the antithesis of what they are trying to be older, campy caricatures of their former selves. Instead, they look so lame and desperate  more because of the vehicle they are starring in rather than their own abilities. There are some other lovely ladies, but you really do not see much of anything. PG 13 definitely could be an appropriate rating for this.

The man is a national treasure, and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a disc to coaster status!","label":0},{"index":1033,"txt":"This movie is a total dog. I found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so I would not feel like I would totally wasted my moneyand my time. The writing in this film is absolutely terrible. It is a shame it is not up to the standards of other Hale Storm movies.They should have saved the money on getting Dlist actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right. Even Gary Coleman was not properly utilized for his role.This movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot wasincluding the subplots. After viewing this movie, I am left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of Napolean Dynamitelike humor, where it is not so much the lines as the character and the delivery. Unfortunately, this movie fails to deliver the lines, the characters, the delivery or the humor. I should have gone to the dentist instead!","label":0},{"index":1034,"txt":"I went to see this film with fairly low expectations, figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff. Sadly, it was not even that. I could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out. I went with my two kids ages 10 and 13 and even they kept asking, How much longer? After lasting until the end, I just kept wondering who would approve this script. Even the reliable Fred Willard could not save the trite dialogue, the state jokes, and the banal plot. I would suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie I use the term loosely should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class. At the least, there are many books on directing, screen writing, and producing movies that would teach them something about structure, plot, dialogue and pacing.","label":0},{"index":1035,"txt":"The really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget Halestorm Entertainment has had to work with.

So when I watched this film, I automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt. I can usually find something redeeming in every movie I watch. And this one was no exception. It does have its redeeming moments. But they are few and far between.One of the first things I noticed that bothered me very greatly was that it seemed as though Halestorm was ashamed of our Church! In the LDS Church, congregations are called wards and the basketball court is in the cultural hall. NEVER ONCE are either of these two names mentioned. The Church is never referred to by name and the standards is as far as it goes in mentioning what our Church believes.It makes me wonder if the directors are really LDS or LDS wannabes? This film had so much potential! It could have really shown our Church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer, but also what we believe. Instead it was only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired. If I were not already LDS, I would be left thinking Mormons are stupid, idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs.It is NOT a film I will recommend to my nonLDS friends.Sorry Halestorm. You can do better than this!","label":0},{"index":1038,"txt":"I have never been a huge fan of Mormon films. Being a Mormon, I have always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the LDS community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos. I was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air, the Halestorm movie I could finally discuss with my nonMormon friends.Boy, was I wrong.I figured, since this had Blist talent like Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson, and Fred Willard one of my favorites, this would have to be at least a little funny. And besides, church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such. But I must say, throughout the entire movie, it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing. Every joke fell flat, and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored. The dialogue was bland, and the film had some of the worst character development I have ever seen. Every single character but Wilsons was less than onedimensional. It is hard to believe that after nine rewrites the film was still as mindnumbingly stale as the train wreck I witnessed. I cannot put into words the rage I felt sitting through this. My friends and I were extras in the final game scene, so we went to the premiere in Washington City, UT. Kurt Hale, the director, was there, and I must say, I avoided all contact with him after the show. He waited at the door, seemingly ready for feedback. I could not bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life, but it left a nasty, painful scar that I will never forget.Here are a few specific problems I had There was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player, but these two characters came out of nowhere, and were impossible to care about, so my friends and I were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame, uninteresting characters. There were many subplots that popped up every now and then, each promising the audience the chance for laughs, but each one came and went in a puff of smoke, ending before you could even start caring. This was pretty much how the whole movie felt.This film was a major letdown, and I feel bad for everyone who is expecting the first REAL funny Mormon movie. True, the jokes in this one are not too exclusive to Mormons. Then again, it is hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing sensation in my ears.Please, do NOT see this movie.

It tries too hard to be funny in some places the daughters over zealous cooking attempts, over reaches in others the scene where they clean up someones yard, so he agrees to join the team and has some scenes that, while mildly interesting, are really just filler all the work scenes. And I did not find the villians intimidating, or worth hating, so much as I found them to be childishly annoying. I have met people like those in the film while playing church ball. And I will say the referees are spot on, Still, in the end, I really did not care all that much about the characters, or their quest for church ball glory. Maybe because they were all so one dimensional, which I might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall.

We had swearing guy, fat guy who eats donuts, goofy foreign guy, etc. The script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot. The production value was so incredibly low that it felt like I was watching a junior high video presentation. Have the directors, producers, etc. ever even seen a movie before?

Fred Willard has been hilarious with some of his Christopher Guest collaborations, but this did not work. They must have spent all the budget on getting known actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget. It looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark. Does it really take that much film to show someone actually shoot and make a basket, as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball swishing through a basket?

The only times anyone has ever come close has been in movies, and you can count those on one hand. So it is no surprise that Tucker has the warmth and appeal of a stripclub bathroom. Did the network actually think we would like watching kids grapple with puberty? Is not this the stuff people go to jail for? If you doubt the show is depravity consider this 13 episodes were filmed but NBC canceled it after only 4 episodes aired; they then made the unprecedented move of burning off the remaining episodes by airing them AT MIDNIGHT so no children could see them. Ironic since kids were originally the target audience. Apart from its general scuzziness Tucker features a running voiceover from the lead character to flesh out the shoddy writing. Even in 2000 it was horribly dated, with it is ska incidental music and supersarcasm.

First off, having at least a shred of intelligence, I realized that a chimpanzee was in fact an ape, not a monkey at all. However, I was sure that the filmmakers would clear this problem up further into the film. They did not. Let me sum up this work of art A company by the name of Z.I.T. has decided to train chimpanzees as soldiers. Why? I think they mention something about the soldiers working for bananas, but when it would cost about an estimated 13 million dollars of government money to train one chimp, this does not seem costeffective. Well anyways, Z.I.T. brings in a CIA specialist Matthew Modine to train Clemens The Chimp. Clemens is everything Z.I.T. hoped for. He can take out an entire shift of guards, who all appear to have gotten their training skills at the local mall, and yet still manage to remind us that we are watching a kids movie. As you may have guessed, Modine finds out that Z.I.T.s intentions may be evil Gasp! and decides to break Clemens out. Being a CIA agent and all, Modine knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city, rent a guest room, regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime, and using checks to pay for everything.Z.I.T. finds out where Modine is staying, and sends two of their finest to retrieve him.

Throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself, a lonely mom who needs a date, and music montages that feature songs that would even be blackballed by Radio Disney and you get Funky Monkey. The climax to the movie? A football game! Played by thugs, bumblers, a chimp, and the nerd boy. No one seems to care about such substitutions at a high school football game.Funky Monkey never lets up! It is edge of your seat entertainment.

Perry as Mr. Tumnus also have the kind of polished, skillful acting we would expect from the very best BBC dramas. And the Aslan costume works very well, amazingly well considering. They got the eyes just right.The bad bits almost everything else, but two areas in particular. One, the casting. England is crammed with good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive British school kids. How could they possibly have ended up with these four stiffs? They move like wooden soldiers and speak about as well. Peter has no gravitas or charisma and is visibly shorter than his supposedly younger siblings; Edmund is just whiny; and Lucy... Sophie Wilcox as Lucy is so dramatically, visibly, drastically wrong for this part that I cannot imagine how she got the job.Two, the animal costumes. Again, it appears that they worked for some kids. If the kids are still at a level where Big Bird and Elmo are exciting, believable characters, they might be entranced by this film. But to a viewer with the sophistication of, say, a 12yearold who is seen Prisoner Of Azkaban? When Mister Beaver comes out from behind that tree, there will be hoots of cruel, derisive laughter. The costumes just do not work  I could not, and I think any adult or modern teen could not, suspend disbelief when looking at Mister Beaver. The drawn animation later gryphons, etc. works better, is easier to take.So ten stars for the very young and tender of soul; everyone else read, or reread the book and watch the far better film that unrolls in your imagination.","label":0},{"index":1064,"txt":"I am a fan of the series and have read all 7 books. I wanted to see this just to see how it was done. All i can say, is that the only people who should watch this are ones who have already read the series and are curious about it. Its pretty bad, and will turn you off reading them. Not to be mean, but Lucy is so ugly it detracts from the movie. Was she the directors daughter? Seriously, I am sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth. She had an overbite that would put any beaver to shame. The movie just loses so much in translation. CS books do not translate as easily as the Tolkein LOTR books, or even Harry Potter.One thing they did right! Aslan! very well done. Although the other human actors with painted faces  beavers, wolf look silly, Aslan was really well done since it was not just a human actor walking around.  i guess its like that old horse custume? 2 people inside?

The film is shot on handheld cameras, and a lot was made of this at the time it was released originally, since we had not had many studio pictures made in this way. I cannot help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything, designed to make the audience think that what we are seeing on the screen has not had all the compromises that come with a big budget, and so was more real. However what we have here is not much more than a notasgood rip off of the first half of Full Metal Jacket, so anyone who has seen that, or any one of the other rip offs there of, will know what to expect.The main problem I had was the stereotyped characters, with the weedy soft kids out of their depth, close harmony singing, Ebonics spouting black dudes, world weary sergeants, bitter and twisted psychos etc etc... all being put into the sorts of situations that would provide the most friction and tension at any given time. Maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation, maybe it was laziness, or maybe it was just a committee trying to appeal to the biggest audience, all I know is it was annoying. One novel thing was the mixture of volunteers and draftees where normally all the characters would have been forced into the situation, although only the scenes between the two main characters really make much play of it. This seems to be the main pivot of the plot, with the volunteers coming to their senses and the draftees gaining a sense of duty and self worth, but its all done in a rather forced and unsubtle way. The other big bug I had was how all the characters with the exception of the psychos and the real softies would react to each inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threats of violence, faced with Farrells ubiquitous stoicism, immediately back down and be all reasonable and diplomatic.I guess if I had to find a plus it would be the acting from the two leads, which was strong and very convincing, tho considering the formulaic nature of the characters, this was not too hard.In my imagination, Bozz grew up to be Zeke off Tour of Duty, and for my money, 4 episodes of that would be more fun to watch.","label":0},{"index":1066,"txt":"Ouch! They do not come much worse than this horrid adaptation of C. S. Lewiss beloved novel. While the adaptation is very true to the novel, the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play. I have read that the budget for this miniseries was the grandest that the BBC has ever given at the time, but surely they could have scraped together a bit more than the 2 that it looks like this was filmed for. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know computer effects were not at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time, but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid. Better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role! Avoid this at all costs.","label":0},{"index":1067,"txt":"Though the movie may have been true to Lewiss book in that the script was basically wordforword, verbatim, it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this. The mythical creatures unicorns, centaurs, griffins, ghouls, ghosts are drawn in, and as in the previous review, the greenscreen flying sequence was very hard to swallow. I nearly laughed to death when I saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth; I nearly cried when I heard the wolfs howl a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could.All of the acting is tremendously forced, especially that of little Lucy Penvensie... I could only take so much indignation, desperation, and buck teeth in the what felt like fourteen hours of watching the movie. The actress who plays the White Witch, in all her histrionics, seems that she would be more at home on stage, where a booming voice, spread arms, and a valiant effort at something Shakespearian would be more than welcome. The sets feel claustrophobic, whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors. Indoors, it is as if BBC could only afford to spend 100 on constructing a set, and so it is very small, and all the characters are constantly huddled together. The White Witchs castle is a rundown, rotting countryside English castle filled with Styrofoam statues and bad lighting. When the Penvensie children are wandering through the woods actually, any scene in the woods feels like they are simply wandering around in circles. The only thing that looks decent in the film is Aslan, but you can bet that BBC probably blew the films entire budget on building the mechanical feline. It looks great when it is standing still and before it starts speaking, but once it starts moving, you cannot help but pity the poor man who has to be the rearend in the lion suit. Yes, if you are a hardcore Narnia fan, you may want to see this version, simply because it preserves every word that Lewis ever wrote but Lewis was certainly no screenwriter, and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen. During the scene in which the children are at the Beavers and getting ready to flee from the wolves, Mrs. Beavers incessant, oh, just ONE more thing, dearies, and then we will be ready to go, punctuated by the childrens simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of NO, Mrs. Beaver, PLEASE!  a scene of comic relief, so incongruous they are supposed to be FLEEING from imminent danger, not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not, detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have. In fact, the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these. I would recommend seeing the new Narnia Disney 2005. The new movie, with updated effects, spectacular computer animation, great timing all around, and a gorgeous and scene stealing White Witch who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician, as opposed to a shrieking banshee captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of Narnia without detracting the least bit from Lewiss original vision I think. Lucy is a lot cuter NO buck teeth, YAY!, as are the beavers and realisticallysized, and bratty BBC Edmund has nothing on the divine, DesperatelyHungryforAcceptanceInsecureand AngstingwithanInferiorityComplex Edmund that the new Disney version fronts. Unless you are the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies, I would not recommend this film to anyone.","label":0},{"index":1068,"txt":"This movie is terrible but it has some good effects.","label":0},{"index":1069,"txt":"I went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned Alice Entertainment.Once I realized I would not be getting that,I watched it for a pretty well made movie in terms of filming,and yeah..that was it.But aside from it having a good film quality,considering I had been watching grainy movies all day long,there was nothing good about that movie.He killed 42.Why were Tweedle Dee and Dum played by Mudler and Scully?Serisouly,Who can answer that for me?Who can answer anything awful about this movie for me.I agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the staff.That is all it seemed to be.Poor Mr.Carroll.I am so sorry somebody did that to his wonderful tales.","label":0},{"index":1070,"txt":"I was unlucky enough to have seen this at the Sidewalk Film Festival.

Normally I am enthusiastic about modern retellings if they are treated well. Usually it is interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story. Unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion. The adaptation of the originals characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying. It probably did not help that the actors were not very good either. Most performances were ridiculously over the top, which I assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script. I did not laugh once through out the duration of the film. All of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by. Really, the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet Alice, but even then the score was a poor imitation of Danny Elfmans work. Also, I would have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave danceoff was awful. It was with out a doubt the low point of the film.What a joke. Do not see this movie.

Of course, my imagination ran amok, trying to conjure up the contents of such a piece of work. Well,now my imagination can be put to rest.I am a lifelong Andrei Tarkovky fan and an ardent admirer of his work. I have come across many people who thought Tarkovskys films are slowmoving and inert. Opinions being what they are, I found this not to be true of the late directors wonderful works, which are wrought with meaning, beautiful compositions, and complex philosophical questions. Upon hearing Aleksandr Sokurov called the heir to Tarkovsky, I was excited to experience his films.With the exception of the open air ride through the fields Stalker, this movie has no kinship to anything Tarkovsky has done. It does not seem to possess the slightest meaning, even on a completely mindless level. It is supposedly gorgeously stark cinematography is devoid of any compositional craft. There is a no balance, no proportion, and the exposure meter seems to be running low on batteries in the freezing snow. The main character is so inept and indecisive, it makes you wonder whether his father might have been alive if he made up his mind sooner.I am also not adverse to nonplots or story lines that progress on multiple nonlinear fashion. But there is not even a nonstory here. One must surely enter the viewing of this film with a shaved head if one were to exit it with nothing gained and nothing lost, as hairpulling would be the only possible answer to a pace that could make a Tarkosky time sculpture look as if Jerry Bruckheimer had filmed a Charlie Chaplin short.I will not rule out that this may be one of Sokurovs stinkers Tarkovskys Solaris, but to conclude that he is one of Tarkovskys heirbased on this film would be to call Paris Hilton the successor to Aristotle. Cmon guys, do not be afraid to say it. No amount of big impressive words is going to magically bring this corpse of celluloid back to life. I do not profess to fully understand Russian culture and I probably do not have Russian values, but I immediately picked up on Tarkovskys work as something magical, a treasure and a gift to viewers.If it did not have Sokurovs name on it, and it aired on say, Saturday Night Live, I am pretty sure nobody would read all these magnificent analysis into this wet noodle of a flick.","label":0},{"index":1073,"txt":"Believe me, I like horror movies. I like science fiction movies. I like independent films. And, I like lowbudget, B movies. Sometimes, I even like bad acting, plodding scripts, wooden lines, improbably situations, and the like. However, I did not like Christmas on Mars. It just does not work on so many levels. For all the reasons listed previously, and many more. That includes the nonsensical, blatant use of images of female genitalia. And the many allusions to male genitalia, in a very Freudian way.I am convinced this is purely from ineptitude. As opposed to some attempt at doing something really different. I mean any movie that takes years to film, just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiences.I had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character. However, sadly, it was meant to have happened, as we saw things unfold on screen. About the only kindness that I can express, is that the image at the end was stupendous. If this had been used at the beginning, instead of the end, it could have allowed the film to take off where 2001 ended... To bad they did not try that instead. I just do not understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made. Was it the plot? Surely, it could not be. Was it the characters? I doubt it; I mean, I could live without knowing about Ed 15. Was it the dialog? Emphatically, no. The music? Perhaps, but morelikely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked.

Such is the badness of this flick. begin digression But let me just state one thing before I start. I am not some Harvardartmajorfilmnoirweenie in fact, I went to the college at the other end of Mass. Ave in Cambridge, the one where the actual smart people without rich daddies and trust funds go, which should put me squarely in the nerdwhowouldobsessivelylovecomicbookfilms census group, and still I hated this film.... My viewing preference is for the highbrow cinematic oeuvre that includes the Die Hards, Bond flicks, Clerks, and The Grail. I wish the Titanic had never sunk, not so much for the lives lost, but so we would not have been subjected to that dungheap of a film. And the single and only reason I will watch a snooty French art film is if there is a young and frequently disrobed Emmanuelle Beart in it. I even gave Maximum Overdrive one of its precious few 10s here on IMDb, for Gods sake. So I am as shallow as they come, therefore I am not criticizing this film because I am looking for some standard of cinematic excellence  it is because Elektra stinks like a threeweekold dead goat. end digressionOK, there is so much badness here that I have to try to categorize it. Here goesMS. GARNER One of the compelling reasons a male would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot JGar I have no idea why my wife wanted to. I think that between this and Finding Nemo, the latter was the sexier film. You know the red outfit she is advertised wearing in every freaking ad you see? You see her in it TWICE  once at the beginning, once at the end. Bummer. In the rest, she basically looks like what Morrissey would look like if he were a female  lots of pouting and black clothes. Which brings me to the incredible range of expression JGar shows in her acting  ranging from pouting all the way to pouting and crying. Oh my God, you would think she was being forced to date Ben Affleck or something horrible like that. Um, wait...THE BAD GUYSGAL They show about the same range of expression and acting ability that you would expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit. At least next to JGars performance, it does not stand out too badly. One guys role is to stand there and be huge, anothers is to stand there and have stuff come out of him, and the womans role is to stand there and breathe on andor kiss people. They manage to pull these incredible feats off. The main bad guy has the most difficult role of all  he has to SIMULTANEOUSLY a appear angry and b appear Asian. He does a fine job at this. I think there was a fifth bad guygal, but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out in selfdefense.PLOT TWISTS! This movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the Democratic National Convention. Let us just put it this way  my wife, who has only been in the U.S. for half a year and speaks only a small amount of English  whispered this to me when the girl first appears in JGs pad, and I swear to God I am not making this up She go to house to kill girl. And father too. And this is BEFORE THE FATHER HAS EVEN APPEARED ON THE SCREEN. Now my wife is not stupid, but she is not being courted by Mensa for her gifts, either, and she is had zero exposure to Daredevil or the comic book genre. And she figured this out in .00015 seconds with no prodding and no prior information. Such is the blatant obviousness of this film. RARELYBEFORESEEN STUPIDITY! OK, so there is this big dude in the film. He can take a chestful of shotgun blast and brush off the shot like it is lint, and he can take a vicious Electra stab to the chest and just bend the metal or melt it  or something  more defenses kicking in, thank God. But JG jumps on his head, and he explodes? An Achilles noggin? OK! Such is the mindnumbing stupidity of this film.Ack. I am starting to feel a cerebral hemorrhage coming on, so I have to stop.

The thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was SO MUCH in this film which went by unexplained, that left you thinking huh, what relevance does that have to the plot? or so how did that aspect of the character come about? I can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in Daredevil, which I have no intention of seeing.Furthermore, the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an aboutface at random moments to suit the storyline, and do not even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic subplot. I am also still scratching my head over the fate of CaryHiroyuki Tagawas character, which seems to have gone by unexplained.If I can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot, but otherwise I gained little enjoyment from Elektra.

But the film itself is shot completely wrong. The bouncing around of the camera and the constant zoomin, zoomout tries to give the film an edgy look as if it were a gritty drama. But it is not. This is an Irish Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and it should be shot like this. It should have smooth movement from one shot to the next.

I am really tired of menacing evil looking characters that lurk in the shadows and prey on the unsuspecting, it is way too overdone. I can remember one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car headlights. Now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension, but sadly it was to showcase the shoestring budget of this movie. As well for a movie that dares to call itself horror, a viewer will find themselves hard pressed to find any actual gore, other than a few scenes with corn syrup and red food colouring. The biggest thing that drags this film down is the pacing and the lack of character development, the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this Bonesetter fellow before a certain time in order to get their kids back. Not that this concept bugs me, but, I did not really find it believable that when the two main characters, both who have lost children can find time to make out with each other. This is done in such a short time span that it is inconceivable, my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before making out with her. The last point that I have is.... and I will not hold this against Kelly, but the movie is shot entirely on boring, emotionless video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just oozed style on film. Although if this movie were given a million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat.

It was supposed to be a training camp not the SS punishment battalion in a Sven Hassell novel. The writer must be a real Army hater. The psycho sergeant who kept beating the crap of people belonged in a prison cell, and the useless Black top sergeant should have been sacked as well. These men were going overseas, the receiving units would surely have wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits were coming from, and an investigation would have ensued. The scene that blew it completely was the electrocution one. Farrell, the alleged barrack room lawyer, would have had the instructor over a barrel for issuing an illegal order  to torture POWs in contravention to the Geneva Convention , actual assault on an enlisted man, sexual assault and conduct unbecoming an officer.

The supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes the effeminate buffoon, the bitter, lonely queen, the fag hag, etc. and the main characters are milquetoast, middleclass, middlebrow clones, of little interest.As far as the romantic  ideological struggles of the main couple are concerned, there is not much to say we have seen it all before, and done much better.","label":0},{"index":1089,"txt":"Or listening to, for that matter.

It is not that the plot is inanein the hands of a good writer it might have worked . . . it certainly could have been much more entertaining. There is not one plot point you cannot see coming for ten miles down the road. The dialog is flat. The jokes are old. To add insult to injury, it is full of onedimensional, stereotypical gays. Nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible, much less real. There was no chemistry, no dynamic, in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other . . . we are just told they are in love. Hard to figure when they have nothing in common and are not compatible sexually. They like the same book? Huh?The acting is not totally bad, but the pacing is excruciatingly slow.

The main point of conflict between the two leads does not play out in a realistic manner at all. There are a few scenes where they disagree because of it, but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently, especially since the employment of Glenn is so wound up in this part of his life and Adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money. Also, several times Glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is apologizing to Adam for his past while Adam is shown to be upstanding and traditional, which the film proclaims to be the good way in the end. I do not like being preached to like that. I attended a discussion session with the director after viewing LTR, and he said that he presented this conflict between them because, if he was in Glenns shoes and he said he does in real life relate to Glenns view that he could never date someone with Adams views. Well, then, I think he should have done a much better job explaining how Glenn could do it in the film. Also, director said he directed this, his first movie, only after reading Directing For Dummies. Directing was not that bad, but far from a top notch effort. I have seen worse, but I rarely leave films feeling this frustrated.","label":0},{"index":1091,"txt":"When this play was first shown by the BBC over 30 years ago, it would have been something quite different for the time.

I do not think so......but if you watch this play again, you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel, rushes straight through the RED LIGHT! maybe that is how it was in dickens time?You will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the Signal Box is very steep and in a poor state.

Lately stinkers have been the exception but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism, mind reeling flash backs and mumbled dialogue makes up for lost time. I have never found Margaret Atwoods books easy to read. This movie continues that fine Canadian tradition. It is not easy to watch.

Us folks in the boonies are a little less pretentious.","label":0},{"index":1093,"txt":"I do not know what Margaret Atwood was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book. I have always been a big fan of The Robber Bride and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works. I am aware that the translation of book to movie is not perfect but this movie was the worst ever. The names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it. I feel like I lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie. This really should have been a miniseries to tell the story the way it was written.The actors for Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia were wellchosen even though I was skeptical at first about MaryLouise Parker. I only wish they would had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book at all.","label":0},{"index":1094,"txt":"When I saw that Mary Louise Parker was associated with this epic novel turned film, I was intrigued. Being a fan of the book, I assumed she would be playing Tony, Roz, or Charis, but more so, I was intrigued to see how they would turn this very heady, almost psychological but not psychological thriller novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who had not read the novel, and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had. The book is a complex reflection of society, women, and modern life, and I was interested to see how they used the 3 different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film. What they actually did was a crime.The biggest error and confusing issue is Why would Oxygen, a network that advertises as being for women, take an amazing book about how complex, wonderful, and terrible women are and can be, and change the protagonist from 3 women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story? It seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask Roz, Tony, and Charis about how they knew Zenia and in doing that, they rushed through bulk of the book. In doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it, aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with. In the film, these women are not people, they are characters.In the book Zenia does fake her death, but the book mentions it to get this point across, while the film wastes 3045 minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use. They tried to make this complex book an episode of Law and Order or CSI.It turns out that Mary Louise Parker played Zenia, which was SO wrong. Zenia is a Catherine ZetaJones, Angelina Jolie, or maybe even a Scarlett Johnasson type. She is a woman men cannot not adore, and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by, but in a keep your enemies closer kind of way. And once she gets closer, she seems totally genuine and trust worthy, despite your better judgment. She is the kind of woman who, even when she loses, she wins she is always still beautiful, still rich, and there are always still people out there who do not know her game.In the film, Zenia did not take Chariss man the blonde American draft dodger who was using Charis in the first place... but instead took August and tried to become her legal guardian and apparently came back to be her Lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies. And Zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with August, but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed. It is was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book, but I think had I not read the book, I would have spent the whole movie confused, if I had bothered to stick with it at all.And Rozs husband was dead before Zenia came in to the picture which was weird since Zenia took Rozs business AND home life in the book, which is why Roz hated her so much and she and Zenia had conspired to kill Rozs husband years and years back. And according to the film Tony and West had been dating forever...even at the party where Zenia and West in the book had painted the whole place black and they made Tony seem like this totally with it and evil, bitchy person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it. Tonys character was SO wrong in this film...she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky, mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book. The film basically implied smart women are evil, beautiful women are evil, powerful women are evil, and women who teach yoga are off their rockers.They basically tried to make it so Zenia was not necessarily as awful as she was in the book, and then, in the end, the three women convince this former cop who, of course in the process of researching this, meets Zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to end with them moving to Barbados or something ridiculous, which of course Zenia bails on to hide Zenias body which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at, but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony, or they conspired together to do it... and then Zenia also managed to take all of Rozs money in the process. By the end of the film I was only half paying attention between commercials bc it had spiraled so far out in space from what it could and should have been.If you are not confused by this breakdown of the film, then maybe you would like it, because I have read the book and seen the movie, and from the movie alone I am ridiculously confused. It was terrible. I get that making a film out of that book is quite a task, but if you are going to take on the task, you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary, instead of creating some useless character to be our Alice in wonderland. Are there really no fluffier books that Oxygen could be making at least half decent TV movies of?","label":0},{"index":1095,"txt":"I greatly enjoyed Margaret Atwoods novel The Robber Bride, and I was thrilled to see there was a movie version. A woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder, and his buddy, an excop journalist, tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead womans crazy female friends. It is fortunate that the movie script fixes Ms. Atwoods clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men, victims of scheming women...Heh. Okay, you got me. If these guys are mentioned in the book, and I am pretty sure they are entirely made up for the movie, I will eat the dust cover of my hardback copy. Apparently, the three main female characters of the novel are not enough to carry the movie. Zenias manipulations are not interesting unless we see them happen to a man, and a mans life is screwed up. Roz, Charis, and Toni tell their stories  to a man. Because it is not important if a man does not hear them.I liked the characters in the book. It hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a mans story. I normally do not look for feminist angles on media, and I tried to enjoy the movie as is. If I had not read the book, I might have enjoyed the movie a lot more. So if you like the cop and the excop, and you want to read more about them, you are out of luck. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot. It is the same plot the movie excavated it, ironed it, and sprinkled it with male angst. It is like Zenias revenge on Margaret Atwood.","label":0},{"index":1096,"txt":"If I had never read the book, I would have said it was a good movie. BUT I did read the book. Who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline. There is so many changes, that it was not really worthy of the Title. Character changes, plot changes, time line changes...First off who was Henry and the investigator? They were not in the story. Henry had Mitchs persona somewhat, but Mitch was not a cop. No you made it so Roz, helped sink  his body and used that as Zenias blackmail against Roz. The real so called blackmail was Roz thought Zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him. Her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being Gay from his mother. Her son was not even really mentioned in the story. Neither I do not believe was his lover, Rozs secretary.Tony and West were not together in the beginning. He was actually with Zenia first while in college. The black painted apartment was their Idea, Tony just went to visit. This is where Zenia and Tony meet, become fast friends. Tony hides her love for West. Then Zenia left west, with cash from Tony, then West and Tony get together. Eventually marry, at some point West leaves Tony for Zenia again for a short time. Only to be heart broken again. Then go back to Tony. Zenias blackmail for Tony was that Tony had written a test paper for Zenia. Now being a Professor at College she did not want to let it get out. I will say the character who played Tony did it wonderfully.Charis character was a blond, not that it really matters. Zenia did not trick her about having cancer while Augusta was alive. No she was there when Charis had a lover named billy. Augustas father, he was a draft dodger in the Vietnam war. Eventually after Charis takes care of Zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal. Zenia and Billy have an affair right under Chariss nose while taking care of them both. Then Zenia turns in Billy to the government, and leaves on the ferry with him. Not with Augusta, Charis was pregnant with her tho. Charis also had a split personality, Karen was her real name.Zenia did not die from being cut up into pieces.... she fell or was possibly pushed we never really knew off the balcony and landed in a fountain. She had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she ODd. She was also really dieing of Cancer this time around.It did not show any of the childhood memories or anything that endeared the characters to the reader.

My significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an allstar cast. Wow  very, very wrong. This movie is an overdone, overwrought, and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot! The copyright date on the box said 2005, yet during the very first flashback sequence I was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s, and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80searly 90s dresses and hairdos. It looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film! I tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback, and therefore supposed to look old, but it looked WWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s... then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up, and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences yet it is a different, much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks. I was completely confused until I saw in the special features the short film included  it was all the flashback sequences, shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie! It also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up and indeed acting the coworker in the 2005 scenes. Thus, this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old, recut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time. The shell story, shot in 2005, is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60s to his girl that they would meet on the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium  an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005? These new scenes and plot might have been OK except the awful, overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clich\u00e9d action that permeates the new movie.

It seems difficult to believe that so many famous people Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gielguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc. would have willingly participated in this farce. But maybe in 1968 people really were so naive? The plot seems written by some confused Latin American Marxist priest with an agenda. There is a superpower conflict and the Russians are actually the good guys, with the Communist Party General Secretary being a nice and spiritual man, who, suddenly, after 20 years, sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a Siberian gulag. The priest then promptly becomes the Pope by a series of coincidences. We are allowed to see the secret Vatican papal voting process which is portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you can possibly imagine.Meanwhile, the communists in China achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their country to death. To solve this minor hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war in order to justly distribute the Western capitalist riches to the poor workers of China.Our good old comrade General Secretary gets a bit worried and calls the Pope just before his coronation to ask him to broker peace. They meet with the Chinese leader comrade Peng who looks and acts like a 15 year old boy. You will roll on the floor laughing about what people in 1968 thought the Chinese looked like. Comrade Peng demands that the Western capitalists must pay which is quite logical after all, do not capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists?, and that the Pope needs to sacrifice something, too, for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice.So when the Pope gets crowned in Rome, he pledges the entire wealth of the Catholic church worldwide to feed our poor Chinese brethren in Christ. And thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaust.Apart from this, there are also some minor subplots, which, alas, provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie. I would give it three Oscars for stupidity.By the way, Anthony Quinn looks quite unlikely as a Pope.

It felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there, not enjoying it, just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying. Id really like to know what the budget is, guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor. I want to write the jokes did not appeal to me. but the reality is for them to appeal to you, you would have to be the man who wrote them. or a retard. So imagine that in script form...and this guy got THAT green lit.

I realized the passing over late in the movie, at first it only irritated me. Many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact, using absurdity and obscenity. The attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails.My personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie My god, it hurts in my head every time I call it movie A bold attempt to turn nothing into something great. But it failed. At least the director made something out of nothing. But it is not something good.Many movies did not turn out as funny as they were planned, but this one tops them all. It is the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making. No. To correct myself, it is even worse than that. A movie with gags so bad, that they are not funny at all. It is not even fun to watch the leadactor, writer and director all three the same guy by the way perish by drowning in the sea of bad movies.

The skits are painfully unfunny such as Batman and Rhymer, the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crude...and stupid.

This is a warning. This sets the record for the worst, most effortless comedy ever made. At least with most of the recent comedies nowadays, the gags are crude and flat, but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny. I never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos Everyone thinks they can do comedy, and only 10 percent of them are right. Comedy is hard! This is not some genre any fool can play around with. I think it is atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to Kentucky Fried Movie. Basically, these bozos are comparing their socalled comic talents to those of the brilliant Jim Abrahams and the Zucker Brothers. Come on, I have seen Pauly Shore movies that are 10 times funnier than The Underground Comedy Movie. Heres a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie One sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named Dkman. The whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen. That is it. That is the whole joke. Wow. This is enough to make Carrot Top roll his eyes. Another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie. And in another sketch, there is a bag lady beauty contest, in which we are exposed to the horrible sights of bikiniclad middleaged women with beer guts and stretch marks. Plus, making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny. It is a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped. The whole movie is supposed to be a satire. I think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire...is TRUTH!!! For anybody who actually enjoyed this crap, explain to me what is truthful about ANY of these gags! Some of the sketches might have sounded funny on paper, but anybody who is taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper, it probably will not be funny on screen. If I tell someone about a big, black, muscular gay virgin, who is saving himself for the right man, he or she would probably laugh. But watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag. I hate how whenever people criticize a lowbrow comedy like this for not being funny, they are regarded as stuckup squares. I just saw White Chicks recently. That is another lowbrow, politically incorrect comedy, but I laughed my head off. The most offensive thing about The Underground Comedy Movie is it is not funny! What the writers and directors do not understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless does not work. There has to be more! Just think of the famous scene from There is Something About Mary ironically, enough the bozo filmmakers put the Farrellys on their special thanks list. The joke about the semen was not just funny because it involved bodily fluids. There was a buildup. Ben Stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he did not go out on a date with a loaded gun. Then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released. A knock is on the door, and he has to answer it. His date, Mary, is at the door and that is when it is revealed that the semen is hanging off Bens ear. In this movie, there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people, with no buildup whatsoever. As Jay Leno always says, This comedy things not so easy, is it? Keep that in mind, Vince Offer, ecause you were not cut out for this genre!! The only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip. Let us face it, nowadays it is hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect. I know comedy is subjective...but this movie should not be funny to anybody, except maybe the filmmakers themselves. As a side note, the movie had to have been made before Michael Clarke Duncans fame in movies like Armageddon and The Green Mile. There cannot be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show. All the others in the cast are either nonactors, hasbeen actors or Bmovie stars. Karen Black made a good impression in Five Easy Pieces, but I do not think she is done anything of value ever since. Slash was probably drugged into being in this film. Gina Lee Nolin is nothing without Baywatch. Angelyne is the films biggest star keeping in mind Duncan was not famous at the time, and there are still probably a ton of people who have not heard of herfor good reason.

This is pure, unadulterated sleaze with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to The Premature Burial, complete with lots of Rrated, readyforvideo sex and nudity. However, it is certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way...Brinke who has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes plays rich, traumatized, insomniac housewife Victoria Monroe, whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father Hoke Howell. Her worthless husband Terry Jay Richardson has racked up some serious gambling debt owed to a gangster played by Robert Quarry and, with help from his kinky, blonde, Europeanaccented sexpot secretary Lisa Delia Sheppard plots to do away with Brinke for her money.

She happens to look like his mother, yes so what? We know he misses his mother, that is what the first ten minutes were about. They should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a O.K. short film. Now it is a portrait of a character who does not change. He is a guy that stuff happens to. The only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job.There is this whole Oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character. He paints his face, dresses in womens clothing and wears a dead Badger on his head. A Badger! You have got to see the ending! He returns to his home with the badger on his head and it is shot like a tacky Horror film to kill his dads new wife which he had sex with in the beginning.

Both Jamie Bell, as Hallam, a physically attractive voyeurcreep, and Sophia Myles, as Kate, his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance, are convincing. The problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life. A young man who spies on the intimate details of peoples lives the way Hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp. And a woman in Kates situation would be repulsed and frightened  she would probably call the police.These things are not, however, what happens in the movie. Poor Hallams mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he is been having an affair. Hallam, of course, hates his stepmother and lets he know it. She has sex with him. Kates some kind of an employment person who places Hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games. She looks like his birth mother. It all ends happily with Hallam resolving his issues.Forty some years ago, the play and brilliantly acted movie, Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf, had a similarly optimistic ending, with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart. The trouble is, it does not always work that way, especially when nobody really cares. In Virginia Woolf, the endings plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation. In Mister Foe, the emotional revelation never really happens.","label":0},{"index":1137,"txt":"David Mackenzies followup to the brilliant Young Adam wants to be a feelgood underdog story of a lonely voyeur who is trying to confront some psychosexual issues with his dead mother. It wants to be gritty, realistic, and mysterious. At the same time, it wants to be funny and nonjudgmental of its disturbed lead as he establishes himself as an adult.To meet this end, the film tries hard to be youthful. Its poster has handdrawn letters looking like that of Juno. Its original soundtrack is comprised of fastpaced indie rock which tries to convince the audience that Hallam is OK; just a little misguided. But strangely the film is anything but youthful.Like Young Adam this films central mystery concerns a drowned woman in this case Hallams mother. Young Adam keeps its mystery quiet, contemplative, and paced well enough to hit you with the truths as they come. Hallam Foe does the opposite. It foregrounds its characters psychosis so clearly and so early that he never really does anything outside his expected parameters. The opening scene is Hallam in his treehouse watching his sister fooling around with her boyfriend. Hallam swiftly interrupts, asserting his presence in the household. Here we see everything that Hallam will do for the rest of the movie.The mystery surrounding his mothers drowning is whether it was suicide or murder by his fathers girlfriend. The audience can never really trust Hallam because, besides being creepy, we think his obsession has led him close to insanity. This hindered the mystery element for me because Hallam is too sporadic to be relatable. Right when he is found some clues that would support his claim he runs away from home, at first it appearing to be looking for the police. Then he gets extremely sidetracked by a girl who resembles his mother, which frustratingly leads the story away from the mystery element.While Jamie Bell does bring out some very endearing traits in his lost character, he was limited by the obviousness of his psychological needs. This movie is in no way mysterious, yet it is not blunt either. It tries to be realistic in dealing with such issues, but it adds a very selfconscious spunk which registers itself as quite the opposite. It goes for a soundtrackheavy, Trainspotting attitude to help the audience root for a protagonist who scales buildings, picks locks, and camps out for the sake of voyeurism. These urban peeping tom adventures Hallam engages in are way too difficult for an inwarddrawn country boy to engage in and they are not sexy, giddy, or pleasant. They are more neutral than anything; not propelling the character or story. Mackenzie makes you understand Hallam, yet he fails to build common ground.He expects you to enjoy Hallams trials and tribulations without much ideological justification. The film hinges on its audiences perspective on voyeurismthe kind of person who engages in it. Obviously, most people would be disgusted by it. And Hallam Foe realizes that, but it does not let us see Hallam weigh the morality of his decisions. He goes from person to person, trying to fill his deep void. There is a particularly disturbing line from Hallams love interest Kate where she drunkenly says I love creepy boys, perhaps asking the audience to do the same. The line tries to foreshadow her understanding of him her motivation remains vague throughout and tries to further us from judging him. It is not hard to like Hallam, but it is very hard to participate in his adventure if it is even an adventure at all. All the while, the film tries to use its flamboyant soundtrack to mask its indecisive mood.Great performances are weighed down by a film with a weak third act, muddy development, and needlessly ambiguous direction from Mackenzie. Recently this film was renamed for a US release, and for what reason? Not only is it more unappealing, but the hard truth is that the Hallam character never earns the title mister.","label":0},{"index":1138,"txt":"I saw this film first in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee.

Baby Face Nelson was not killed after he escaped from Little Bohemia in a robe. Homer Van Meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns. Homer Van Meter was cornered by the police in St. Paul and gunned down with machine guns. Another member of Dillingers gang, Harry Pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie. Pierpont was not shot. Harry Pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair. I go into what happened to Baby Face Nelson on my Baby Face Nelson review so I am not going to go into it again here. Let me also add that Richard Dreyfuss portrayal of Baby Face Nelson is pathetic. There is a scene where he attacks Dillinger and then gets a bad beating. While Dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming, Leave me alone! Baby Face Nelson and John Dillinger never fought. Maybe Dillinger did not agree with Nelsons bank robbing methods, but they never fought. Nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten. They keep calling him Lester Baby Face Nelson. He was never in his life known by that name. Nelsons real name was Lester Gillis and he changed his name to George Nelson. The black guy that escaped from jail with Dillinger was Herbert Youngblood, but in this movie he is known as Reed Youngblood. John Milius does not know anything. Where the hell did John Milius get his information? I could probably make a better movie than him.Finally the way they showed John Dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable. The movie shows Dillinger walk out of the Biograph with the Lady in Red and his girlfriend Billie Frechette. By the way, Billie Frechette was not even there that night. But a girl named Polly Hamilton was. Melvin Purvis yells, Johnny! Dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell. It is a proved fact that Dillinger did not have a gun that night. The FBI gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away. They did not even have to shoot him. They were so close that powder burns were found on his face. It was murder. They also say that the man killed that night was not John Dillinger. After killing tons of civilians in the Little Bohemia incident can you imagine the FBI reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man? The gun they had on display that was supposedly on Dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after Dillingers death. I could go on and on how the man they killed was not John Dillinger, but I will stop here.

This movie was horribly inaccurate. It is like they got a list of names and just made everything up. His robberies and getaways were well planned, down to the second  when the time was up, they left whether they had all of the money or not. They had notes of every road, where to turn, etc. Purvis never saw him at the restaurant, he was told that Dillinger paid for his meal after Dillinger left. Purvis never even SAW Dillinger before the night Dillinger was killed, only photos of him. The way his gang members died were fictitious. Dillinger never robbed a bank by himself, like he did in this movie. If I had never read the book, maybe I could have enjoyed the movie. The acting was a bit over the top in places. The action was overdone as well. On second thought, I doubt if I would have enjoyed it much even if I Had not read the book.","label":0},{"index":1141,"txt":"Proof why Hollywood conventions are in place. Stale dialogue, underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe. An attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slaptogether attempt at recreating the magic of Arthur Penn s Bonnie and Clyde 1967 and George Roy Hill s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 1969 truly innovative filmmakers and films  but falling well below the bar. Problems with storylines being selfexplanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections. The editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically. Unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor. Stills, black  white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that cannot transition well or to replace scenes that just did not work at all and again are reminiscent of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 1969.Overly dramatic pauses between sentences, random shots of surrounding scenery that was not needed for storytelling plus overthetop acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late 1980s  I was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during postproduction. The playing of music in most two shots and closeups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score. No sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots, doors, footsteps and dialogue a style used in the late 60s through the mid70s by new directors but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial  particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads. In my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no likeable characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story. Neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters I wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the hero a necessity for any story to work for me. We know from Penns and Hills movies who the heroes are. Even though they are criminals, we like them and want to see them get away. I could care less who was on the screen in this film. I got the impression that John Milius was trying to give off a nonhistorically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding John Dillengers life from June 1933 to July 1934 his death.To be fair, there are some moments of good solid storytelling, which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits. John Milius gets better thankfully in future films where he does not seem to try to copy other filmmakers. Dillinger 1973 is not a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial big budget debut, but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy.","label":0},{"index":1142,"txt":"Near the beginning, after it is been established that outlaw John Dillinger Warren Oates, is an egomaniacal rapist, another bandit of the 1930s is cornered in a farm house and surrounded by the FBI.

Bang, bang, bang. Purvis emerges alone from the house, carrying the female hostage, the miscreant dead. All in long shot.If you are enthralled by stories like Red Riding Hood, this should have considerable appeal.Oh, it is as exciting as it is mindless. Pretty Boy Floyd meets his demise dramatically.

Wherever moviegoers ventured, AIP would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles  in the 50s came horror movies like Voodoo Woman and The Undead; in the 60s were Frankie AvalonAnnette Funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like The Glory Stompers; and into the 70s, AIP churned out grindhouselevel trash like Cannibal Girls and Sugar Hill.Dillinger, released in 1973, is one of the more highbrow AIP efforts that capture the true spirit of drivein filmmaking; it is one of those uneven, overthetop flicks that satisfied the masses thirst for entertainment, craftsmanship and common sense be damned. On the whole, Dillinger is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours, but certainly not memorable. Heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact, Dillinger was a fair effort by screenwriterdirector John Milius Magnum Force but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career.The 109minute Dillinger  epic for AIPs scope  follows the quest of FBI Midwest chief Melvin Purvis, played by Academy Award winner Ben Johnson. Purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four FBI agents killed in a 1933 Kansas City ambush that helped gangster Frank Nash to escape justice. At large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout, including expert bankrobber John Dillinger Warren Oates, Pretty Boy Floyd Steve Kanaly, and psychopath Baby Face Nelson Richard Dreyfuss. Dillinger eventually joined forces with Floyd and Nelson, taking along Homer Van Meter Harry Dean Stanton and Harry Pierpont Geoffrey Lewis. He also hooked up with Billie Frechette Michelle Phillips, a prostitute of French and Indian extraction. While taking place over several months in 19334, Dillinger is basically a chase film, with Purviss entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by J. Edgar Hoover.Dillinger has a documentary feel, listing dates and places while Johnson supplies loose narrative as Purvis. Milius keeps an honest Depression look, using authentic fashion, cars, weapons, and buildings; he also sprinkles around blackandwhite photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts. The film is never boring, moving at a quick, if haphazard, pace. The action scenes are Dillingers strongpoint, edited competently by Fred Feitshans Jr in his last professional effort. Thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film, not to mention pounds of explosives. This film is certainly not for the squeamish, with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place. The violence, while gratuitous, brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on American life.This film never transcends its exploitation status, however, because the needed writing just is not there. John Milius, somewhat overrated as a filmmaker, places way too much emphasis on action. The action scenes mostly bloodfilled shootouts are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era, including 1967s Bonnie and Clyde. But we simply do not get to know much about Dillinger and his gang members as people; the vital relationship that develops between Dillinger and Frechette is barely touched upon, with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward. Melvin Purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline, becoming a prominent figure only when Milius needs to keep the film from unraveling. All too often, the film takes on a shootemup persona when its characters could have been explored in detail.Aside from this, the pictures main crime is ignorance of historical fact. While many say that Dillinger is just a film, it is films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent. Those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that John Dillinger was not the last of his ring to die, as Miliuss screenplay and the films documentary style encourage us to believe. In fact, Dillinger died before Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter; he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death, nor did he have Billie Frechette in tow. While these inaccuracies might make for high drama, there is no reason why Milius could not have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them.Warren Oatess performance as Dillinger is quite good, although he sometimes looks unconvincing. Oates is humorous and nicely portrays how Dillinger became consumed by his largerthanlife image in the American press; however, we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime. Ben Johnson gives some life to Purvis, suave but rather flat. Michelle Phillips brings emotion to the Billie Frechette character and it is really too bad that Miliuss screenplay did not flesh out her relationship with Dillinger. We never learn what drew her to a coldblooded killer, other than the stereotype of an easygoing girl who is attracted to men of danger. The supporting roles with Kanaly, Dreyfuss, Stanton, Lewis, and a brieflyappearing Cloris Leachman, are acceptable for such talent.As a piece of 1970s exploitation, Dillinger appears doomed to retail bargain bins, which is exactly where I picked up MGMs DVD release for 4.99. The film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drivein flicks with subtitles in French and Spanish. Dillingers theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra. Largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drivein enthusiasts, the film does not really call for much else in way of supplementary material. For fans of the genre, it is certainly worth checking out. out of 4Roving Reviewer  www.geocities.compaul_johnr","label":0},{"index":1144,"txt":"First off, I must admit that both films I have seen by this director I saw without titles and so may have missed the points.

It is about ten different story lines that weave in and out together. That is not so deeply unusual in a town the size of Prague tiny, really. The main characters are between 20 and 30. They have got jobs and only one studies. The best character is the young Balkan girl. Her sentiments are echoed by immigrants here every damn day. That is about it. The only great character. Everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own. How can I sympathise with such obvious incompetence?

Do not get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining bad films e.g Manos \u0096 Hands of fate and then there are the awful bad films. This one falls into the latter category. The cinematography was unbelievable, and not in a good way. It felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot, the lighting was something between one guy running around with a light bulb and non existing. The actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors, and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them. The only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer, a classic look a la Jason Vorhees from Friday the 13Th. The Plot was extremely poor, and the ending even worse.

It is unfair to review the film and compare it to other highbudget films. But alas, that is what one must do. On its own, it is not very good. And compared to others, it is still not very good.

True, it is not as bad as it is previous show, Flavor of Love  but it is just as bad.It reminds me of a skit from the 90s show In Living Color where Keenan Ivory Wayans was imitating the boxer Mike Tyson on The Love Connection dating show and he picked Robin Givens for a date.

Perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn Willard Hyuck and Gloria Katz an Oscar nomination later in their respective careers, Messiah of Evil has potential, but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it cannot muster the filmmaking prowess to pull it off.The premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back. It does not take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity  and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe Messiah of Evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70s exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror.The surreal nonsequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the blood moon, a scruffy and halfmad alcoholic played by the great Elisha Cook Jr. in perhaps the best scene of the movie who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley eaten by dogs a little later, the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her fathers paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded, murderous, squirreleating albino.Part of the movies charm is precisely this brand of bargainbasement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way. Whereas with Lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator, with Messiah of Evil the boundaries between the intentional, the unintentional and the did not really expect it to come out this way but it is good enough  WRAP SCENE blur hopelessly.Take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drugaddled, feverish, streamofconsciousness way, one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father, and the other narrated by her fathers voice as she reads his diary. While we are still talking about a living dead picture, Messiah of Evil is different and only loosely one  at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be. The origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse, bestowed upon the town by a mysterious Dark Stranger who came from the woods one day. In the meantime Hyuck finds time for snippets of massconsumption criticism in a flesheating supermarket scene that predates DAWN OF THE DEAD by a good number of years you can hear the MST3K line already man is dead, only his capitalist food tins remain and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater.I generally think that the surreal works in careful, well measured doses  how is the absurd to work if it is not hidden within the perfectly normal? Hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand. When the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her, you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience, amused and satisfied with his own hijinks. The general filmmaking level is also pretty low  after the halfway mark, the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either. Add to that the choppy editing, average acting and Hyucks general inability to capture true atmosphere  the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused  and I would file Messiah under missed opportunity but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate  even though it is not particularly gory, trashy or sleazy.","label":0},{"index":1172,"txt":"I just watched this movie in high definition on television.

His message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream societys job market is great. And my problem is not with the real person who did these things. HE was a great man. But this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching, that I found it insulting.First of all, they did not cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability. Sure they were competent actors, but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually HIRING THE DISABLED for anything in the film. Further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches, appearing to have only one leg. But the CGI in this scene is so apparent it is shameful. What? They could not find an actual amputee anywhere for the film? For a 5 second shot it was more financially sound to do CGI effects than to just HIRE an ACTUAL amputee?

The double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body? What about infinity land?  The game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another, suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger. What about the relationship between his parents, and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father? His feelings of neglect when his brother was born? What about his fascination with insects and animals? How he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his home?What about focusing more on his cannibalism? And what about his parents divorce? These are all things that should have been included in the film. Instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down snapshot from a night or two in his life, and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks, to events that were not even particularly relevant to our understanding of Dahmer.Why did not the film maker show how Dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people? He could have made this point many times, particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them which actually took place in a health club, not a night club. Instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behind.Whilst I appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into 90 minutes or however long, but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with Luis Pinet? known as Rodney in this film. My only guess is that the director was trying to build up Pinets character, to try and make us fear for or empathise with him, but this film is supposed to be about Jeffrey Dahmer, so why could not he have spend those forty five minutes on something else? If the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough, but it was not. The scene in which he kills Steven Hicks, his first victim, is a vital part of the Jeffrey Dahmer story because it was the first killing, and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life. Unfortunately the film does not explain that it was his first killing, or that he did not kill again for nine years. We assume, because his hair style is different, and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback, but to when? And why? What about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career?one of the most important clues we have towards understanding Dahmer and his motivations..Some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal, but having studied Jeffrey Dahmer in depth, it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed. Why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on Jeffrey Dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that ensued?Finally, a film with subject matter as repellent as this should carry an 18 certificate, not a 15. We needed to see his perversion in more depth, to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us. That does not mean showing the drill actually entering Konerak Sinthasomphones head for instance, but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed, and what his Modus Operandi was when actually killing. Anyone watching this film who does not know the story of Dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people. He actually killed seventeen men.Aside from the facts and lack of depth, the film is not all bad. There is some nice cinematography, and good performances from the two main characters. I would like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge, more energy, and a better reason for making the film in the first place.","label":0},{"index":1175,"txt":"Disappointing and undeniably dull truecrime movie that has poorly cast character actor Jeremy Renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of Jeffrey Dahmer, who was easily one of the last centurys most recognizable degeneratesserial killers.

The archaeologists call the tribe the Tropi and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery. But things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist Vancruysen Paul Hubschmid declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers. He questions whether the Tropi are truly human and takes his argument to the courts, where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued.This was a very early film in Reynolds career, and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he is in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously. Not that Reynolds can be blamed \u0096 he has an impossible role, asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a Tarzan flick. His character and the film are not relevant to each other. Clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist, and there are nice supporting roles for British actors Edward Fox, Alexander Knox and Wilfrid HydeWhite. A major shortcoming in Skullduggery is the lame and ineffective makeup used to give the Tropi their strange hairy appearance. Rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids, the stuckon hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical\u0085. and that is just not the right idea. We are meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures, but that is awfully hard when they look so unconvincing. Skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant, philosophical and stimulating. The honourable intentions are there for all to see, but the end result does not do them justice. A worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless.","label":0},{"index":1196,"txt":"The only reason I elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. All I can say is, it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film. As far as I could tell, Borgnine was the ONLY actor in it. The other performances were so uniformly terrible, I am amazed a studio would actually pay the performers to appear. Couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that I thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled, and you have a perfect cinematic disaster.

I was wrong. I realize that people say this not to anger the African American community if they are not African Americans themselves. I always hear complaints on how African Americans are never nominated and how they should have won. Sometimes this is true not as much nowadays because Whoppi Goldberg should have won best actress for The Color Purple and the movie should have won best picture. The only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was, is because people see a movie about the SEMISPOILER hardships of an African American during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece.Denzel Washington is an outstanding actor, but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever. I was bored with him in the movie, and his acting here was quite similar to his role in Malcolm X but not as good. The audience is supposed to leave believing this man, Rubin Carter, is a saint. People left the movies worshipping this man, this hero, and they went out and bought his book, making this hero of a man rich.SPOILERS This movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit. Of course the crimes he did commit stealing mostly was only to survive, nothing more. People felt sorry for him, even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society. Everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife but why would not itafter all, it is his point of view. I do not like movies especially Hollywood interpretations that are based on true stories because they usually distort the true parts into something else, something not so true. This was his point of view and a Hollywood construction, yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably. Well I researched his past a bit before making any assumptions, and he was a very violent man. Not only that, there is still a possibility that he did murder those people. If you do not believe me, search for him on the internet, and read the articles some people have of him. The boxing match he claimed to have won so easily, was actually won by his opponent Joey Giardello and there are tapes to prove it. Besides that, there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie. The supporting cast were the nicest people I have ever seen on the face of the Earth and their nice and perfect persona looked difficult to keep up.This movie was a Hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully.

Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who, at best, was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be was arrested multiple times for beating women is strange to me. Ruben Carter was never, by viewing his actions in the 60s and even now, when he refuses to speak to his son, a person that people can look up to. Everyone knows that Jewison can direct, and Washington can act, but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me. Is Hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable? Heres a suggestion How about Denzel playing a movie about himself?

They even built a makeshift fa\u00e7ade to convince people that the store itself actually existed.One might well ask, Why do such a thing? Well, that is a very good question, but the answer the filmmakers provide is not all that satisfying a one. Essentially, we are told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something  even something that is not true  simply through the power of advertising. And the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the real i.e. higher purpose for the charade is to convince the Czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the European Union. Fair enough  especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers, all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of research into what does and does not work in advertising. In a way, by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments, these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the ruse.But, in many ways, the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target, it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it. For it is THEY THEMSELVES and NOT the goodhearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here, as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people, some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot.

Or that they are stupid and gullible because they do not suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised? Such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real world.No, I am afraid this smartalecky, nasty little stunt only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots.

It is so bad I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she would pretty much finished with it in Robin and Marian. This is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. It is really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the Dorothy Stratten appearance just prior to her homicide.There is nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow.Who could believe that there are even some of the same Manhattan environs that Hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in Breakfast at Tiffanys twenty years earlier? The soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and the Gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obviousyou sure do not have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cinemusique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you.Reverting to type means going back up as well as going back down, I guess. In this case, Audrey Hepburns chic European lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Here she has even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like AnnMargret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and Mongoloidlevel situations.Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. After this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious TV movie with Robert Wagner called Love Among Thieves. In They all Laughed it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50s. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective than is Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. Hepburn does not take it seriously at all, could not be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good work was in Two for the Road, perhaps her most perfect, if possibly not her best in many ways.And that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening. John Ritter is horrible, there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see Dorothy Stratten, who was truly pretty. Otherwise, critic David Thomsons oftused phrase losing hisher talent never has made more sense.Ben Gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then, and so we have 2 films with Gazarra and Hepburnwho could ask for anything less? Sandra Dees last, pitiful film Lost, from 2 years later, a lowbudget nothing, had more to it than this. At least Ms. Dee spoke in her own voice; by 1981, Audrey Hepburns accent just sounded silly; she would go on to do the PBS Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through English gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about what I like most is when flowers go back to nature! as in naturalized daffodils, but in an actual fictional movie, she just sounds ridiculous.To think that Breakfast at Tiffanys was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with Audrey Hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the worldshe was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in My Fair Lady, matching Garbo in several things and Delphine Seyrig in Last Year at Marienbad. And then this! And her final brief role as the angel Hap in the Spielberg film Always was just more of the lady stuffcorny, witless and stifling.I went to her memorial service at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, a beautiful service which included a boys choir singing the Shaker hymn Simple Gifts. The only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of Hepburns singing Moon River on the fire escape in Breakfast at Tiffanys, and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregation.A great lady who was once a fine actress as in The Nuns Story and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50s and 60s who became a truly bad onethat is not all that common. And perhaps it is only a great human being who, in making such things as film performances trivial, nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilesslywhich all of her late film work contained in abundance. Most of the talk about Hepburns miscasting is about My Fair Lady. But the one that should have had the original actress in it was Wait Until Dark, which had starred Lee Remick on Broadway. Never as celebrated as Hepburn, she was a better actress in many ways Hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid, although Hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part. After that, all of her acting went downhill.","label":0},{"index":1223,"txt":"Loved the original story, had very high expectations for the film especially since Barker was raving about it in interviews, finally saw it and what can I say? It was a total MESS! The directing is all over the place, the acting was atrocious, the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat, empty and completely unnecessary whats up with the generic music video techniques like the fastforwardslow mo nonsense? It was stylish yes but not needed in this film and cheapened the vibe into some dumb MTV Marilyn MansonSmashing PumpkinsPlacebo music video. Whilst some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal, some are just ridiculously laughable the first kill on the Japanese girl was hilarious and Ted Raimis death was just stupidly funny. It just rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense, totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it in the finale which by that point just feels tacked on to mess it up even more. No explanations were given whatsoever, I mean I knew what was happening only as i would read the story but for people who had not it is even more confusing as at times even i did not know where it was going and what it was trying to do it was going on an insane tangent the whole time.God, I really wanted to like this film as i am a huge fan of Barkers work and loved the story as it has immense potential for a cracking movie, hell I even enjoyed some of Kitamuras movies as fun romps but this film just reeked of amateurism and silliness from start to finish I did not care about anyone or anything, the whole thing was rushed and severely cut down from the actual source, turning it into something else entirely. Granted it was gory and Vinnie Jones played a superb badass, but everything else was all over the place, more than disappointing.

The most appropriate term to summarize the whole film in just word is nauseating! The violence is sadistic and extreme, which undoubtedly attracts fanatic young horror enthusiasts, but it is also indescribably gratuitous and exploitative. Normally speaking, I am very proviolence but it has to at least serve some kind of purpose. The butchering \u0096 literally \u0096 depicted in Midnight Meat Train is exclusively meant to shock and to repulse the viewers with weak nerve systems and easily upset stomachs, and even that is not fully effective due to the use of digital computer effects. There are more shortcomings, some even bigger than the pointless gore, but perhaps I should focus on the good elements first. The basic concept is definitely promising and multiple sequences like the chase in the freezer room, for example are literally oozing with nailbiting suspense and macabre atmosphere. Unfortunately the pacing is very uneven and the elaboration of the potentially fantastic plot is made unnecessarily convoluted. Presumably the processing of a short story into a long feature film scenario is responsible for the pacing irregularities, but I honestly feel they could have done more with the denouement as well as with the character played by Vinnie Jones. The plot introduces Leon, an aspiring photographer in New York whose agent advises to search for the truly menacing face of the city through sinister pictures. Leon then becomes obsessed with stalking an introvert and suspiciously behaving butcher who always awaits the midnight train. Leons right, as the butcher turns out to be a relentless serial killer who literally crushes his victims with a big hammer, but the killers motivations and behavior suggest there is something far more substantial going on the rails at night. Midnight Meat Train takes place in naturally unsettling locations like subway stations at night and animal abattoirs, plus the film also benefices of good acting performances and a truckload of downright disturbing images like cadavers on meat hooks and train carriages smeared in blood, but director Ry\u00fbhei Kitamura Versus, Godzilla Final Wars does not take full advantage of it all. The ending leaves a whole lot questions unanswered and, even if Clive Barker meant to have like this, I still think we deserved a slightly more clarifying finale. Midnight Meat Train is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film, but not without defaults. It is not intended for easily offended viewers, but maybe people looking for plot coherence and clarity should leave it alone as well.","label":0},{"index":1225,"txt":"I do not know why, but i thought i have seen this movie before. Maybe it was the name, maybe it was the way poster looked, i do not know. Anyway, it was quite promising in the beginning. And even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments. Maybe its because i am not a huge fan of the horrors, and i do not watch them a lot, but this one actually looked fresh sometimes. But the rest of it is not so good. Laughable at times. The movie is slow paced, sometimes you will get so bored you would forget what was the story about. Characters are not great either. All of them. The butcher is OK, seems creepy and crazy enough. Although i did not get what were those weird looking things on his chest that whole scene just looked fake and kind of outoftheblue, and why he was collecting those in jars at home? The main lead is plain. His character is really hard to believe in, and very undeveloped. But i guess thats scenarists fault. Like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend? Side cast is bad too. But the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl. My god, when will women in horror movies have any brains? Its ridiculous. The girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera, tries going to police, that fails, and then she thinks of the best idea ever. Why do not we just go and take it! I know where the maniac lives! Yup! Thats swell! And then look for the camera in the bathroom! Why not? And then walk in the room, see a bag that was not there before, and just have a look inside. Maybe camera is there? Not there. But loads of interesting stuff. Shiny. Mmmm. To realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain. Then of course the never ending falling while running away trick, that really made it look bad. Then, to put the final nail into the character, in the end of the movie, she walks into the wagon FULL with dead bodies hanging feet up, screams Noooo like she just ripped her Gucci bag, and walks further into the wagon... Jeez. Come on. No one else thinks its just, well, stupid? Just awful. If her character was not so bad, maybe the movie would get another star or two from me. And i would even forgive MMT characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer that dude in the train who the conductor killed, butcher vests that can protect from bullets, weird and cheap looking monsters in the end i did not read Clive Barkers novel, so i have no idea where those monsters came from, the fact that no one cared that hundreds judging on the skeletons in the dungeon disappeared in the city, and main character that did not bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out he barely noticed it i guess. Oh, and the predictable ending. Damn, i knew the ending half way in, its just disappointing. The only reason i am still giving some credit to the makers, is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i have watched past few months. Visual style is nice, some shots were really nice and good CGI that made the killings look really brutal. although blood did not look real at all I guess some people will enjoy it, some, like me, will watch it if there is nothing else to watch, some will absolutely hate it.","label":0},{"index":1226,"txt":"OK, so I just saw the movie, although it appeared last year... I thought that it was generally a decent movie, except for the storyline, which was stupid and horrible... First of all, we never get to know anything about the creatures, why they appeared, wtf are they doing in our world, and really, have they been on Earth before we were or did they just come from space? Secondly, the role of the butcher to maintain order is just so obviously created... Really, how large could the underground for a sub station could have been? There were only so many of those creatures, so I think instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could have just planted some tactical bombs, or maybe clear the are and a Nuke would have done the job. I know it sounds funny and it is, but I do not see the killing of people as being NECESSARY... Thirdly, Leon acts like Superman jumping on the train and fighting Vinnie Jones, who was way taller and bigger in stature. Then again, when he faces the conductor he does nothing and acts as a wimp, watching all the abominations. I mean OK, the conductor had creepy helplol, but if Leon was so brave he would have gone all the way... I mean he risks his life first, then does nothing exactly when he should have. He could have died as a hero but lives as a coward... this might be the case, but not after showing so much braveness earlier on... Then, the cop thing... come on! This was a city having a subway, I bet there must have been other cops except that lady, other police stations,this was really kind of silly... All in all, great acting by Vinnie Jones, interesting idea up to the reason behind it which is not really built at all... By the way, what did the signs on the chest mean? Vinnie Jones cannot make up for the rest...","label":0},{"index":1227,"txt":"I am not one of those people who just go online after I see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made.

The worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was. I know it was a story by Clive Barker and all, and no I have not read that story but it appears to me that if you have not then you will be, as I was, completely clueless and utterly disappointed.The film begins good enough the actors are convincing, the story interesting. The first scene is bloody a great way to catch your attention. I thought the blood looked a bit bad, but seeing as it was the very first scene I did hope for improvement later on. I was wrong. The blood and effects are so horrible, it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that, for instance, someone could knock a persons head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer. WTF? CGI blood did they even use ANY real blood at all? My home made stuff looks better than any used in this film!, unbelievable acts of dismemberment eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head; arms cut neatly off does no one remember there are BONES all throughout our bodies?!, toodark scenes every scene is either an odd yellow color, or in hidden in shadows...it just gets worse and worse. I found myself pointing out mistake after mistake. There is just too much. Add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serialkiller movie turns into some demonicsupernaturalmonster movie at the end...no thank you! It should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway OK, with a conspiracy theory thrown in and an overzealous photographer. Maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant? Plausible, doable...and a lot better I think than the real story. That could have and should have worked. Instead it became a creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you, and unless you read the book, well...you just will not ever understand it fiasco.

A film about the members of this basketball culture could have been very interesting, but the mediocre acting and poor script in White Men Cannot Job left something to be desired.The movies sequence of events is cyclical. First, Billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball. He then returns to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. Most stories build up to a climax of some kind, but the climax I saw was just another sequence in this repetition this case being Billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball.In order for a plot to develop, some dilemma must be resolved; and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well. Apparently the writers of White Men Cannot Jump forgot this rule, as the plot can be summarized as Billy needs to pay the bills.

If it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater, this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material. It has been favorably compared to Audition by Japanese director Takashi Miike much to Kims satisfaction, but aside from some astonishingly good performances, especially given what they had to work with, by lead actors Seo Jung and Kim Yoo Suk, I find little reason to recommend this film. I have not seen Audition, but I doubt it would alter in any way my view of The Isle. Its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic. Its sex is not pornographic, but passionless and masochistic. Characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot. Its point is either nonexistent or, I will admit, lost amidst Korean cultural quirks that I fail to understand.The only beauty is in the cinematography, which is classic Kim fogshrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake, mountainous terrain dominating the background, and an imaginative and playful use of color. At times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big Kim Ki Duk romper room. Some touches, like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by Jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes, are intriguing. But as a film, this effort is downright confusing and, in the end, offensive to the senses, not necessarily to sensibilities. One hopes that Kim will leave this kind of filmmaking in the trash heap of his past, for we know he is capable of so much more.","label":0},{"index":1249,"txt":"I generally do not give worry much about violence in films, or a vast amount of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us. There is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature, a good setting of characters, a good direction. This film could be voted for as a good film. However, it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting.First of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film. Not movie violence, I am talking about REAL violence. This violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two; the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women. Not that we all do not have some real twists with women.respectively men. But the conclusion of the film ruins it all. spoiler Our heroine finally dies, by here own hand if I remember correctly I saw this film years ago and it enraged me, now the guy is out with a new film witch I am certainly not going to watchand is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon, nature growing over her, in particular her sex.. Of course it is the director who kills the women heroine. Women have to die, especially if men are attracted by their sexuality. That seems to be the final conclusion.end spoilerWell, well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself. But to use big pictures, artsy directions cruelty to living creatures, just to say men can be frightened of women, and men are cruel to women. Thats just not enough.

The book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous, and illogical. Oprah gives a palatable appearance as Biggers mom, but is not nearly at her potential. Other famous performers also seem to be at their worst. The plot which centers around an African American who decided to take a job as a chauffeur. In driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted. One thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he is working for are not against blacks, but he thinks they are. So when he comes home he puts her to bed, but she begins caterwauling.

Filmed in what the old movie posters used to call A Riot of Color it resembles nothing more than an expensivelydressed but intellectuallychallenged production of The Student Prince .Mr James Mason,wearing a very natty little white number,utilises his allpurpose mittelEuropean accent whenever he remembers.I am a great admirer of his and I sincerely hope the remuneration was comensurate with the distaste he clearly felt for the character he was playing. Mr Omar Sharif,who built a career largely founded on looking directly at the camera with his big brown eyes and looking soulful,gives a stupefyingly monotonous performance as his son the Crown Prince.He is utterly unconvincing as a man who in the movie at leastcut a swathe through the distaff side of the Austrian aristocracy.With his wellbuttered locks firmly in place he preens and poses in ever more unlikely uniforms.As a rebel he talks the talk but conspicuously fails to walk the walk,leaving a bottom button undone on one of his tunics is about as far as his defiance goes.Unhappily married,he falls in love with a commoner.Forbidden Love is one of the movies comeons.As she is played by the most uncommon Miss Catherine Deneuve he is scarcely pushing the envelope there.Miss Deneuve has a profile to die for and we see rather a lot of it,particularly in the sequence set at the ballet. Now I love ballet as much as the next man,but this sequence does seem to go on for an excessive amount of time,a more cynical critic might consider it to be padding. Rudolfs mother,the Empress is played by Miss Ava Gardner.She gives the part some good old American oooomph,making her a bit like Auntie Mame,but it is done with undeniable style.Rudolf is certainly very fond of his mother  I will put it no more strongly than that. The only performance worth watching is that of Mr James Robertson Justice as Sir Lancelot Spratt  sorry,Edward,Prince of Wales.He is so wonderfully unconcerned about everything going on around him it is a joy to behold.I waited vainly for him to ask Rudolf the immortal question What is the bleeding time?.

So, stumbling across the DVD of the 2003 documentary Noam Chomsky Rebel Without A Pause, in a used video store, a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 911, I decided to get it, just so I could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person, pro or con, spoke of him. While glad I got the film, my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was, so what is all the fuss about?For a man with so many degrees, lauded as the most important intellectual alive, by the New York Times, according to the DVDs case, there sure was not a lot there, intellectually speaking. I know I would chew him up and spit him out in a debate, and I would not even want to watch what a William F. Buckley could do to him. Granted, the whole film was seemingly about Chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere, and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he would say, rather than being on linguistics, so maybe that is the reason he came off so badly. But, again, if he is a linguist, and tops in his field, why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise?\u0085. Even worse are his acolytes, who seem to further insulate the man from reality, by fostering delusions that Chomsky is a target for Zionist assassins. What little I knew of Chomsky before watching this film, this much I knew he was generally considered a has been, and pretty much irrelevant intellectually, since the fall of the Soviet Empire. The film is so poorly structured, and without a narrative thread, that it is difficult to separate all of the jumble. His wife, Carol, as example, apparently gave one interview, which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film. She seems a nice enough woman, but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life. The lone interesting thing she says is that 911 was a great thing for the Chomskys, for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then.Not surprisingly, this sort of film gives almost no biographical background. It is assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this great man bears. Chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one. Stylistically, there are no camera movements, no interesting edits, nor any signature touches, and most of the film is disjunct rambles by Chomsky, videotaped huzzahs of Chomsky declaiming on this or that, and slackjawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial, that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him. This is really poor filmmaking by director and editor Will Pascoe, who in the DVDs Filmmaker Statement, shows he is yet another uncritical acolyte of Chomskys. Other than that, one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary, but mere agitprop, and a vanity piece of agitprop, at that, is that not a single time is Chomsky shown struggling with an answer. He seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds.Given that much of this dreck was filmed during Chomskys lectures at McMaster University, in Ontario, Canada, prior to the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, much of what Chomsky says seems as remote as things from the Vietnam War era. Yes, he makes some good points, here and there, on American media complicity before the war, but he follows them up with sheer lunacy, for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc, and not fully plotted out cabals. As example, he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace, but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled. Similarly, he claims Trilateralists run the world and that peoples fear of crime is yet another cabals result. Of course, that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers, and all that wasted time and money district attorneys offices consume. He also makes the absurd claim that Cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades, when Castro and company were great sponsors of it, in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, until the Soviet Union fell. I can only guess that the UFO conspiracists are just waiting for Chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up speciesmixing impregnation centers up in Idaho.In his simpleminded world without grays, Chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of Bushco, whom he reviles, are; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals. In short, Chomsky is a man living in the past, in over his head on most issues, and out of his depth intellectually. Near this films end he warns, Be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice, yet one can only laugh, as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he did not like, no matter how barbarous their crimes, and antiintellectual their posit. Please, pause before you waste your time and money on this silly, and already irrelevant, DVD.","label":0},{"index":1257,"txt":"First off, I agree with quite a bit that escapes Mr. Chomskys mouth. His matteroffact delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a hit on the university campus circus. He comes across likable, unassuming, pragmatic. He does not cater to the current political style obnoxious bipartisanship and he sets his sights on the far left as well as the far right, chastising both, and for good reason.Unfortunately, the film itself is a dud. In fact, I would not even call this a documentary but rather just a collection of speeches. Watching Rebel Without a Pause is no different from watching a speaker on a 3am taped segment on CSPAN. There are no camera movements, no edits, no stylistic touches. There is no story, no narrative.Technically speaking, the production is strictly amateurish. Audio is terrible and inconsistent; sometimes we cannot hear Noam speak, other times we cannot hear the questions that are being posited by those in attendance. When Noam is speaking rarely are we allowed to see the reactions of the audience except when we are given a quick shot of his wife who apparently attends every one of his speeches and beams with pride every time we see her.I cannot recommend this film and would say that you are probably better off checking out his taped speeches on cassette or CD to listen to in the car.4 out of 10 stars...and I am in a generous mood today.","label":0},{"index":1258,"txt":"A documentarist, like any filmmaker, must convey a compelling story. Will Pascoe fails utterly in this effort, cobbling together uninspired snippets of Chomskys wisdom from a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton. The footage is shot amateurishly and in video. Pascoes only effort at cohering the fragments into a whole is by periodically throwing a vague title on the screen 911, Activism, Truth.Lame.Compare this with documentaries like The Corporation or The Fog of War which create a narrative drawing material from interviews, stock footage, and filmed footage. In the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly and intelligently.The only saving graces of the film are Chomskys nonchalantly delivered upendings of historical dogma, and the fact that the running time is only 74 minutes.One of the more interesting passages was Chomskys recounting of his experience with National Public Radio. He describes the conservative media as more accommodating to dissenting views, while NPRs liberal dogma straitjackets its interviewees and dramatically limits its permitted messages.

Still, I was surprised by just how bad it was. I am a big werewolf fan, and have grown accustomed to forgiving a great deal when watching one. Most of them have subpar effects, poor acting, and weak storylines at best rehashed from earlier films. So far, with the possible exception of some of the later Howling series films, this is the worst of the lot.First, the story. It is been quoted several times in reviews on this site, so I will not go into specifics. However, it is very obvious that the writers had absolutely no affinity for lycanthropic monsters. As so often happens when a horror film is given to a writer who considers themselves above such fare, they tried to come up with a new spin on the werewolf mythos. That is fine, but a nonhorror fan trying to do this generally has disregard for the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing down to them. The plot feels like a parody of werewolf films, and the events depicted just ring so false that I felt my intelligence was being seriously insulted. TV news footage, for example, never pans away from the reporter to closeup on someone in the crowd behind them. Give the characters and the viewers credit for being able to spot the bad guy in the scene without using a flashing neon sign. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.As for effects, I have NEVER seen a less believable werewolf. I would have been happier with Lon Chaney Jr. in crepe hair. The beast they used look a great deal like... well, like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with some hair glued on and some truly awful animatronics. And, I know that many people have already criticized the CG, but my God it was awful. One scene features a woman changing, and starts with a completely CG version of the actress, nude but for some reason without nipples. My first thought was, hey, why is one of the characters from ReBoot turning into a silly looking werewolf?Anyway, I like to look for positives in any film, and there were a few. The cinematography was passable the film was shot alldigital, which is interesting and some of the performances were not terrible. It was also interesting seeing Tippi Hedron as the worlds most well madeup homeless woman, and Kane Hodder as the title bad guy. Also, the Yellow Power Ranger got all growed up and... well, damn. And if you are looking for skin, there is some pretty tasty examples. This ends the malepig segment of the review.Overall, if you want a good werewolf film, try An American Werewolf in London, the original The Howling, Dog Soldiers, or even The Wolfen though that ones got more wolf than were.

The subplot of a book of werewolf linage which effected some of the other characters in a spelllike manner for a while was effective, but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past.

Not for flesh, not for blood not that it seem to mind to take a bite on the way though, but for a mate. He is on the hunt for a girl. Not any girl though. The Girl. The girl that is pure and also a werewolf, although she does not know it yet. Three, well check that, two cops after the first scene and an old bag lady is all that can stop it, or even knows that the thing killing and eating a lot of folks around full moon is a werewolf. This particular powerful werewolf, Darkwolf, is closing in on the girl. If he gets her, mankind is doomed. Now the cops has to find the girl, convince her not only that there is someone, a werewolf nonetheless, that wants to rape her, and perhaps kill her, but that she is a werewolf herself. And then they got to stop him...Comments This is one for the boys, the teenage boys. A lot of scenes with seminude girls more or less important for the plot. Mostly less. Well I guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is expectedly thin. And unfortunately there is little besides the girls to help the plot from breaking. One usually turns to two main themes. Nudity. Check. And then special effects. Hmm... Well there are some things that you might call effects. They are not very special though. In fact, to be blunt, they are very bad. The movie seems to be suffering of a lack of funds. They could not afford clothes for some of the girls ;, and the effects are cheap. Some of the transformations between werewolf and human form, obviously done by computer, are really bad. You might overlook such things. But the Darkwolf in itself is very crude too, and you never get to see any killings. Just some mutilated corpses afterwards. And there is surprisingly little blood about, in a movie that honestly should be drenched in blood.I am not sure what to say about actors and characters. Most of the times they do well, but unfortunately there are lapses were the characters or actors just looses it. A few of these lapses could be connected with the problems mentioned above. Like the poor effects, or the poor budget?. That could explain why there is precious little shooting, even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in plain sight and not moving. But hey, when you are in real danger, there nothing that will save your life like a good oneliner...Unfortunately that cannot explain moments when the Cop, Steve, the only one who knows how to maybe deal with the problem, the werewolf that is, runs away, when the only things he can be sure of, is that the werewolf is coming for the girl, who is just beside him now, and that he cannot let it have her. But sure, it let the makers stretch the ending a little more...But I would not mind seeing none of the lead actorsactresses get another try in another movie.Well. To give a small conclusion Not a movie that I recommend.310","label":0},{"index":1277,"txt":"In this day and age of incredible special movie effects, this one was a sore disappointment.

The acting was awful, the only one with some decent acting was Samaire Armstrong. The plot is not original, if you are a horror fan then it is just the same stuff you have seen many times before. Some scenes did not make sense at all, and you just get the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer! The monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie. The scary scenes looked like they belong to a horror movie from the 80s when there was not enough technology, yet some good movies were made back then! I was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the movie, i thought could not they put some money in this and make it decent?!!

Understandably Josie has a hard time believing it, that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes. It is up to Werewolf cop Steve to save Josie, the day  the world...Coexecutive produced  directed Richard Friedman I thought DarkWolf was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that did not really do anything for me. The script by Geoffrey Alan Holliday starts out promisingly enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show  then there is a Werewolf attack which leaves someone splattered everywhere but after this decent opening sequence it is pretty much down hill all the way I am afraid. For a start it is slow going, it is dull, it is predictable  it is populated with highly annoying characters who come out with lots of bad dialogue  do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the Werewolf they do not, I have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead. The script is dumb  does not explain itself, why has Josie never turned into a Werewolf before? Is she really the only one? Why cannot this dark prince find another female Werewolf? There are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about halfway through but you get the idea anyway, as a whole the film plods along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is underwhelming to say the least.Director Friedman lights the film quite well with bright neon but this is noting new or original  does not really improve the film as a spectacle. Now let us talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in DarkWolf are far from special, the Werewolf transformation is achieved using CGI  it is among the worst looking CGI I have ever seen, seriously a Playstation would be embarrassed about these computer graphics. It is easily the worst Werewolf transformation I have ever seen, An American Werewolf in London 1981 was made over 25 years ago yet the special effects in that are literally lightyears ahead of the ones seen in DarkWolf, who says special effects have improved over the years? The animatronic puppet effects are not much better either although at least there is something psychical on screen. The gore is not up to much after a gory opening kill there is some blood splatter  plenty of dead bodies but not much else. Thres a fair amount of female nudity if that is your thing but do not get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it, is it really worth it?Technically DarkWolf is alright apart from possibly the worst CGI effect ever, it is reasonably well made  it at least seems to have production values. The acting is what you would expect really.DarkWolf is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that litter video shop shelves  clutter the schedules of obscure cable TV stations, I did not think it was as bad as some but it is like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said  done they are both horrible still...","label":0},{"index":1280,"txt":"Why bother seeing this movie, if you have great movies to see.

Within 15 minutes, the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines, so there is absolutely no mystery, which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense. The only halfway competent actor is killed 10 minutes into the film, so we are left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things. Low budget films cannot afford expensive special effects, so the CGI portions are unsurprisingly unimpressive, but were at least a valid attempt. The creature suit is terrible, as seen when it falls to the sidewalk, and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes, which are not even the red color shown in mirror shots. The dialogue is clumsy and uninspired, with some lines reminiscent of Aliens or Terminator. The last action sequence takes place in a police station, also a ripoff from Terminator, with everyone hiding in the one glass lined office that the Darkwolf does not smash into. In the end, the girl calls the hero a good Protector, but he gets both his partners, the original Protector, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen cops, all killed without getting a decent shot off, in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun.

What is worse is that poor Kane Hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf. Kane fcking Hodder. Someones trying to ensure that playing Jason Voorhees is the height of his film career...Anyway, former Playmate Jaime Bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf, too. It is kind of a crappy cop drama with the worlds worst looking werewolf in it. But it does have moments of nearrampant nudity. But that is about all. Want to know more? Okay, the werewolf is generally an uglylooking black blur zipping around the screen.

One of them is black, and shock horror! he is the one who gets killed in the first five minutes. The film goes downhill for the next hour or so, then picks up a little with some decent action sequences, before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending.For the most part, the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who is willing to settle for less. If nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and Alosio, along with some of the supporting cast, shows signs of talent.

Jack Black is also a very funny manirritating at times, yes, and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him, but funny. There has rarely been a Jack Black comedy that I did not enjoy to some degree. So, I was very happy to hear that Jared Hess, the writer and director of Napoleon Dynamite, and Jack Black would be teaming up for a movie about a Spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage. My only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin. Unfortunately, my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie. This plot, had it been done as a skit on some such show as Saturday Night Live or possibly even Mad TV, would have worked flawlessly. Unfortunately, the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this onejoke comedy falls flat.Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a devout man of the Lord. Feeling shunned by the entire monastery, Nacho Black, now the monasterys cook, decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler. As the monasterys finances hit an alltime low, Nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monasterys orphanage. This plot sounds so sweet and caring. It seems like the perfect movie for Jack Black. Look what he did with School of Rock after all. Well, to my displeasure, this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie. It is again Hollywoods way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humor\u0085of course, for all I know, maybe that is the general thought of teenagers, as many seemed to enjoy this movie. Watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh, but do not expect to get an award for putting it in your movie. A sevenyearold could make up the same joke.The performances in Nacho Libre are actually good. Jack Black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic, worthless lines in ever put on paper comical. Unfortunately, this movie just was not enough for him. It did not give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him. I had never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before, but now I can say that, not only is she quite talented, but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight. She just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well. H\u00e9ctor Jim\u00e9nez, who plays Nachos bumbling partner, Esqueleto, kept me laughing continuously. He did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of Jack Blacks. Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named Chancho, did not have many lines, but, what can I say, I just enjoyed him. He was adorable. The rest of the cast did their job. It is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a subpar movie.Nacho Libre just does not work. Its plot is stretched far too thin. The heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just do not work. I very rarely laughed and, if I did, it was because of Jack Black or another member of the cast. And that leads me to the bright side of Nacho Libre yes, the cast. This cast was just\u0085well, for lack of a better word, they were on. They all clicked, had excellent chemistry together, and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script. After Jared Hesss Napoleon Dynamite kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie, I was surprised to find myself so often bored with Nacho Libre. Something was lost here and I have yet to understand what it was. All I know is that Nacho Libre is not a good movie and yet, because of its cast, it is completely worthless. There is a small reason to watch, if only to watch Jack Black work. But, if you are not a fan of Jack Black, then avoid this movie like the plague.

I used to practically live on VH1 up until the spring or winter, I forget which one now, of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Out of sheer morbid curiosity I would guess that is what you would call it I had decided that I would go ahead and give it a looksee anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap. At least I can honestly say that I was not a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basementlevel to begin with. The emphasis of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980s and what was and was not culturally significant or popular which is what I was expecting to see, but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really godawful noname comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills rolls eyes...more like lackthereof if you ask me! It is pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at socalled humor that I swear I could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid oneliner they shot off one after another!

Much worse than Pacinos close ups, however, is the wretched excuse for a plot. Early in the film we are given indications that Pacinos character is gay, and I suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended. Later, however, we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles lust after this elderly, half dead looking, effeminate man with the ridiculous accent. The worst part overall was the main plot thread, which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never, ever care about in the slightest.

Along with his girlfriend Mara Willims Shannyn Sossamon  fellow priest Thomas Garrett Mark Addy Alex travels to Italy to delve into his mentors death, as the truth begins to emerge it appears that Dominic was a Sin Eater someone who absorbed others sins  lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully  that the Church was not happy about his activities. Alex must do what is right even if it goes against what he believes...Also know under the title The Sin Eater this American German coproduction was written, produced  directed by Bian Helgeland  did not really do that much for me if I am honest  I usually am, honest that is. Anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some OK ideas but it is throughly predictable, excruciatingly dull  boring, really silly at times  it takes itself far too seriously. The whole concept is daft  while it thinks it is clever with it is oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up  brings the story full circle I thought it was the most obvious  lazy way to end things. There is the usual religious themes here, morality, sin, forgiveness, faith, belief, prophecys, blah, blah, blah you know the sort of thing. Then there is the twists which are not hard to see coming, there is the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen, corruption, greed, evil, etc. you know the sort of clich\u00e9d Hollywood ideals  themes that get reused every time it deals with the Church. The Order has nothing new to say  as a serious piece of filmmaking it sucks, a lot. I am not too sure who The Order is meant to appeal to, as a diehard horror fan I did not see much horror in this at all, as a thriller it is less than thrilling, as a mystery it is too predictable  there is nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest  for some reason I cannot figure out the IMDb also lists The Order as an action film which is absurd as it is as exciting  actionpacked as the average episode of Sesame Street 1969  present, harsh maybe but it is what I think...Director Helgeland does an OK job, the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme  it all looks a bit drab, grayish  dull. For a supposed horror film The Order is very light on scares or horror elements, in fact there are not any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason, do not ask. Forget about any gore or violence as there is not any which is fine but it would have helped at least make The Order somewhat watchable. According the IMDbs Trivia section the release date of The Order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny, all I can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they are not exactly brilliant as it stands now.I was amazed to see The Order had a budget of about 28,000,000 which is a hell of a lot of money  I just cannot see where it all went apart from the sets  production design which are good. The whole film looks  feels very average  utterly forgettable. The acting is OK although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foulmouthed comic relief irritates, a good actor such as Peter Weller deserves better than this.The Order, I prefer the title The Sin Eater actually not that it matters too much, misses all of it is intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as I am concerned  is a pretty dull way to waste 100 odd minutes of your life so do not do it!

Keep accepting scripts like The Order and Four Feathers and he is going to be on the fast track to movie oblivion.Here are the problems I had with the film. Firstly, the Director tried to make up for the inadequacies of his essential plot by introducing two other plot lines that seemingly had little if anything to do with, well, much of anything. Plot skeins involving the American trying to take over the Vatican and the Dark Pope, while mildly interesting, did nothing to reveal to the viewer anything about the main characters. The attempts to tie these threads together were pathetic at best. Secondly, please do not insult the intelligence of the viewer by inserting into the film scenes that are clearly obligatory. We had manufactured angst, manufactured love and most idiotically manufactured sex that seemed like a page right out of Matrix Reloaded with skullnumbing techno music. Rather than developing character, these elements seemed like the cheap devices they clearly were, a halfhearted attempt at putting popcornchewing adolescents in the seats. Thirdly, and most importantly, this movie seemed to ha ve an intriguing concept. We have scandal, we have religion and we have supernatural forces at play. Why then do we learn almost nothing about anyones background? We learn a little about Alex, but even he gives up the passion of the priesthood to sleep with a woman after two days, a woman who tried to kill him during an exorcism at some point in the past. And Alex is the most developed, if you can call it that, character in the entire film.As the cliche goes nowadays, if you are going to see one movie this year, make sure it is not this one.

It is not even accidentally funny, like for example Showgirls.You know that the producers are assuming that their audience is not going to be very smart. They renamed the movie, originally titled The Sin Eaters, because they figured Americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was, even though they go to great lengths to explain what a sin eater is in the movie.

She also liked Grease II, so you are in good company.Back on topic, Heath plays a Catholic monk from a specific you guessed it order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor. He has celibacy issues, possibly because nobody in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion, much less be a celibate monk.

In fact, without orthodoxy, films like this are just an anythinggoes smorgasbord of the filmmakers usually dull and illogical imaginations.Think about it.

The story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way either.....for a more interesting and worthwhile application see any Luis Bunuel film....very sharp satirepotential spoiler alertReally, the blow job in the cemetery that Jeroen Krabb\u00e9s character works so so hard to attain.... do you even care? is it funny? since Mr. Voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of control.....though i am guessing he did not cast Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 because he is the worst actor and every character he is played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass.... except he is incompetent at it. So it becomes like a weird caricature. Do you think Mr. Voerhoven did that on purpose? and Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 is the butt of the joke as well? I just do not see it...... So you understand the dilemma i am faced with here right? It is the worst film ever because he is supposed to be a good director. So there is some kind of dupery involved. I knew Patch Adams was horrible without even seeing it. Do not be duped by The 4th Mans deceptively alluring packaging or mr. Voerhovens reputation as a good director etc. etc.","label":0},{"index":1333,"txt":"My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video.

I may just be Logophobic. For no word combination scares me more than when at the beginning of a film, credits contain the words Produced, Written and Directed by, and are followed by a single individuals name. Think about it. There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but so few jackofalltrades. Even the most seasoned of directors like Speilberg and Scorsese rarely take such control of their films. But there I was, all nestled in my theatre seat, popcorn in hand and about to watch The Order when hurled at me like a Nolan Ryan fastball, were the words Produced, Written and Directed by Brian Helgeland. Whoa! Being a film buff, I knew of Brian Helgeland. As a writer his filmograpghy over the past 10 years would be graphed like a dotcom companys stock price in 1998. There were as many theatrical unpleasantries Assassins, The Postman, Conspiracy Theory as there were critical and award winning successes L.A. Confidential, Mystic River. They seemed to alternate \u0096 one good, one bad, so knowing that his last film, BloodWork was one of the most wasted efforts in Clint Eastwoods career, I took a breath and hoped for the best. In retrospect, I should not have exhaled. The Order stars Heath Ledger Helgelands A Knights Tale, as Alex Bernier, a priest in an order known as the Carolingians, who is summoned to Rome when a fellow priest is killed under circumstances that the Arch Bishop deems \u0091curious. Meeting up with Father Thomas also of the Order and played wonderfully by Still Standings Mark Addy, they set out to piece together the riddle left behind in the wake of the priests untimely death.Complicating matters is a sub plot involving Mara Sinclair played by Shannyn Sossamon who has escaped from an institution that was the result of her attempts to kill Alex during an exorcism. Alex has feelings towards Mara and for some reason unbeknownst to the audience, they travel to Rome together.Nary a good nights sleep goes by and Alex is confronted by William Eden Benno F\u00fcrmann who claims to be a centuries old Sin Eater. A Sin Eater, as we are told, are those that eat the sins of a dying individual when the church does not, thus allowing entrance into Heaven. William, as luck would have it, is tired of a life of healing and looks for Alex to take over his role and free him from his worldly duties. Alex is reluctant, but after the death of his new love Mara, Alex resorts to the ritual of the Sin Eater to save her and the transformation is complete. Alex then searches for answers to his many queries while Father Thomas unveils the Vatican plot behind the passing of authority to his fellow investigator. The Order is not a terrible film, but it is terribly boring. There were ridiculous special effects and no connection with any of the characters. Even in the most dramatic scene  that of Alex walking in on the dying Mara  is pale and bland and leaves us with no emotional response towards the couples plight. Everybody seems to talk so quietly and unemotionally that the film flat lines and smelling salts could have been administered to keep me from trying to grab a quick nap in the middle of the film.So, Mr. Helgeland, I plead with you not to try this again. Share your vision with others and allow those more experienced to help direct you in directions that are not so narrow minded and selfserving. Until then, there is nothing emanating that shows you are capable of anything more than a failing grade. Two stars.","label":0},{"index":1335,"txt":"Horrible waste of time  bad acting, plot, directing. This is the most boring movie EVER!

Bottom Line  do not waste your time.","label":0},{"index":1336,"txt":"In the bygone days of the Catholic Church, a sineater was an individual that, through ritual, would take the sins of a dying person upon themselves. Often, these people were excommunicate or similar individuals who the church would not absolve, thereby denying them entrance into Heaven. The sineaters were seen as blasphemous, circumventing the chruchs monopoly on redemption. Sex this up a bit with some overt supernatural mojo, let the concept wander where it may, and you have The Order, a movie that combines Stigmatas religious antiauthoritarianism, The XFiles paranormal investigation, and The Thorn Birds sexual spirituality into an odd melange that sometimes works.Alex Heath Ledger is a rogue priest, one of the last members of the Order of the Carolingians, a semiheretical order of knowledgeseeking, demonfighting priests. When Alexs mentor is found dead under bizarre circumstances, Bishop Driscoll Peter Weller sends Alex to investigate. Tagging along are fellow Carolingian Thomas Mark Addy and Mara Shannyn Sossman, who was subject to one of Alexs exorcisms a year prior. The three go to Rome to investigate and are drawn into a dark underworld of bizarre Catholic heresy, ominous prophecies, demonic intrusions, and a man claiming to be the last surviving SinEater Benno Furmann.Written and directed by Brian Helgeland who worked with the same principals on the scattershot and halfhearted A Knights Tale, the film is an odd one, and difficult to classify. It wants to be several things at once  supernatural thriller, religious intrigue, dramatic television pilot  and only sometimes succeeds at any of them. This is not helped by the slow pace or the fact that most of the actors seem to be sleepwalking through their performances with occasional bursts of brilliance. Ledger, in particular, has a particularly stunning scene of despair in an otherwise monochromatic performance. Sossman, however, displayed the same disconnected performance that she is given in all of her films most notably in The Rules Of Attraction.The plot itself meanders back and forth between several different story arcs, leading you to wonder which is the main one with each arc containing its share of red herrings. Large gaps of narrative appear to be lost between scenes at times, which can be confusing for many, but this is also one of the films saving graces. The structure of the film  coupled by the fact that there is never a truly clear antagonist until the very end of the film  forces the viewer to analyze and reason in a time when most films are blatantly obvious about everything the exception to this is historical background on the Carolingians and the practice of sineating, both of which are explained in dry exposition. Even at the beginning of the film, character relationships and history are inferred instead of explained. Combine this with the onlocation shooting and judicious use of special effects, and you have a very oldworld supernatural thriller, with even the opening credits reminiscent of something from the late 70searly 80s.A brief mention here, as well, for the subtle and organic score by David Torn, a combination of minimalist orchestration and Lisa Gerrardstyle exotic vocals. A very nice score that is evocative without being bombastic and exists in a very deceptive simplicity.A confusing plot, a lack of purpose, and sometimes sleepy performances would often damn a movie, but for some reason, The Order remains watchable. Many people will be very turned off by the movie for its odd sensibilities, and some may even become angry that they are forced to engage the higher functions of their brain to understand it. Still, the films sheer intangibility will prevent it from being either a critical or commercial success until the DVD, which I am sure will be stocked with copious amounts of deleted scenes. A recommended film only for people who like to think while they watch. 6 out of 10.","label":0},{"index":1337,"txt":"The screenwriter poorly attempted to recreate the Exorcist.

The comedy of Flashmans character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do. The dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic.Looking back with more mature eyes, the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the Prisoner of Zenda.If you have read the book and not seen the film, I can only say that the film ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game Rudi has just invented Russian roulette.A pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about.My comments would be more direct if I had seen the film more recently, but I am glad I have not.If by any chance Fraser ever reads this, I can only say I think he is a geniusperhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation, but, based on my appreciation of that corpus of work, it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film, as that he did all those awful Roger Moore James Bond films.","label":0},{"index":1341,"txt":"As an avid fan of the Flashman books by George McDonald Fraser, I looked forward immensely to seeing Flashy on the big screen when this film was first released. Sadly it was a huge disappointment then  so I left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again, but it was no better the second time. Mr Fraser is a tremendously skillful writer, but I am not a fan of his film screenplay work with Richard Lester. The penchant for slapstick spoilt The Three Musketeers for me and the same applies here. To me, the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong. The Flashman books are uproariously funny in parts, but they are adventure novels. There is much seriousness in the way the adventures that Flashman has  after all, he is involved in dangerous situations. This is conveyed in the novels, but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style. It is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book. When I first read that the book was to be filmed, the article said that the film was to star Oliver Reed. I rejoiced, as Reed to me was the epitome of Flashman. How I would have loved to see him in the role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but does not fit the visual image of Flashman created by the books too scrawny looking! Flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow. Neverheless Reed was excellent as Bismarck. What kills the film is that it is made as a comedy. The only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills de Gautet Tom Bell. A great shame, as the production values, costumes, sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent  just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from Malcolm McDowell. Possibly the directorship of Richard Lester was responsible for the way the film is, as a recent radio adaptation of Flash For Freedom, adapted by Mr Fraser, worked quite well. Perhaps one day we may see Flashman done justice on screen.","label":0},{"index":1342,"txt":"Raymond Burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend Dick Foran thanks to his affection for his friends wife Angela Lansbury. This was a full year before he started doing Perry Mason, so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting.There is not all that much else here that is interesting though. Lansbury is always good, but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious. There is an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter who is also in love with the femme fatale, but the Burr character is pretty straightforward. It is frankly bizarre to see an actor like Burr doing these romantic scenes with Lansbury, and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films I have seen him in. There is no mystery at all really, and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that Burrs character is setting up the Lansbury character to implicate herself double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder, presumably.

Reve fondles a statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum. Plus there is a lot of blood.

To be honest, this film if one deigns to call it that is of real interest only to bondage freaks. Bettie Page fans will learn absolutely nothing new and I do mean nothing, nor will they enjoy the warm fuzzies of experiencing anything familiar, loved, or cherished.Nevermind the abysmal screenplay, the wooden, lessthancommunitytheater acting, the utter absence of direction, the crappy lighting, or any of the rest of the bargain basement production values. This is definitely Hey, kids, let us make a movie! moviemaking of the lowest order. I suppose one could be thankful that at least they knew how to run the camera. No, I am sorry to say that none of that is germane to why this thing is so outright wrong.It is wrong because the young lady playing Bettie Page, a somewhat zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the Queen of Curves is dark hair and the trademark bangs, utterly fails to bring anything to the role beyond a willingness to be bound and gagged. This is apparently a good thing for her film career before and since this wretched excess, but not for the wretched excess itself, which consists primarily of a number of lovingly reenacted BD setpieces sandwiched between horrendously awful fauxbiographical scenes delineating Ms. Pages fall from grace so to speak. There is actually probably more information, per se, about Pages life in the opening and closing credits than the rest of the movie.Do not be fooled. This is not a worthy companion film to The Notorious Bettie Page. This is not a worthy film at all. This is a fetish piece that trades on the allure of one of the greatest pinups of all time, and does it without class, without style, and without any real sense of understanding the character of Bettie Page whatsoever. No true Bettie Page fan will find it to be anything but a disappointment, I guarantee that.Avoid at all costs. If free, remember that time is money, too. Yours may not be worth much, but I am betting it is worth enough that you will be sorry you wasted time with this one. That is it, I am done, you have been warned.","label":0},{"index":1361,"txt":"This documentary is a reenactment of the last few years of Betty PagesPaige Richards career. The Tennessee tease was the most recognizable pinup queen in history. Her most memorable work came in the 1950s and was fetish photos, bondage and catfight girly flicks. Irving KlawDukey Flyswatterat his Movie Star News instructed Betty on what to do in front of the camera. There was no nudity in the famous photos or stag films, but nonetheless, Klaw was charged with distributing obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution. It is no surprise that Betty had a cult following at the height of her career. The girlnextdoor with jet black hair, blue eyes and an hour glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not would mesmerize for decades. After all, it has been said that she was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world, Elvis Presley. Betty Page would disappear and devote her last years to religion. This movie actually could have been a lot better; but good enough to hold interest.Miss Richards is stunning in her own right. Bra, panties, garter belt and hose do not hurt her image in the least. Also in the cast Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone.

The film appears to be a loving tribute to the greatest pinup to ever live  but there is so little actual content that the film itself is virtually pointless. I cannot really see what the motivation or point of this film is  as there is very little biographical information provided in the narrative  so those who do not know much about Bettie are not gonna know much more after watching DARK ANGEL either...The film basically chronicles the last few years of Betties career in bondage modeling. Almost the entire film is comprised of reenactments of some of Betties more famous photoshoots and loops. These reenactments take up literally 75 of the films runtime, and give virtually no insight into Bettie as a person. The film touches briefly on her shortlived legitimate acting pursuits, and her subsequent decision to leave the business and become religious  but all of this is pretty much glossedover in favor of showing long and drawnout reenactment scenes...DARK ANGEL is not a horrible film  there is just no substance to it. The other problem is that the actress that plays Bettie only really resembles her in farther away shots  upclose it is a nogo. The other thing that irritated me, is that although Bettie did several topless modeling shoots  the only nudity in the film was a short segment shot in a zoo during the end credits. The film itself is obviously extremely lowbudget, but does what it can set and costumewise within it is limitations  so no gripes from me there. The acting is pretty wooden and unmemorable from everyone involved. In fact  the most memorable thing about the whole film for me, was noticing during the end credits that the actor who played Irving Klaws real name is Dukey Flyswatter. No joke  check the cast list. Cannot say that I recommend this one too highly unless you are a true Bettiefile completist and must own anything relating to her. And if you are that bad off  then you need to seek treatment anyway...410","label":0},{"index":1363,"txt":"This movie was bad beyond belief. I saw it during the 2004 San Francisco Film Festival. Before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before, which happened to be its world premiere. I do not think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point. We all understood by the end. Its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one. Dark Angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to Bettie Paige, in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old Bettie Paige movies. The movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least. A scene would start going then someone would say wow you are so great Bettie, why do not we make another movie. this would be followed by a 5 minutes of a Bettie Paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as and even more boring than the normal part of the movie. by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another Bettie Paige movie remake came up. it was that ludicrous. I heard a lot of laughter in that theatre, but people were not laughing with the movie maker, they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure. This was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory. I know movies are expensive. I have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else I have ever seen. The movie looks like it was made for 12. The cuts, the graininess, and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience. This movie makes Dude, Where is My Car? look like Citizen Kane. My friends and I left the theatre feeling like we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured. The only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good. Apparently, the previous night, the night of the world premiere the directorwriterproducer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie.

It plods back and forth between vignettes of Betties story and recreations of the Klaw short films.

And, at times, she does bear a remarkable resemblance to Bettie. Also of note is some faithful attention to detail. Costumes and clothing well done, as is some of the set direction.

One of the most serious examples in 19th century USA of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of goldbearing gravely hills on the sides of the Sacramento Valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s. This process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside, causing the material to wash downhill, where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment. The sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the Sacramento River or its tributaries. The sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas. Some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields, where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult. Thus, the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by Warner.First, we might ask why Warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor Technicolor, a very rare treatment in 1938. A story about wheat farmers and gold miners would not seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time. The answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors, with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations. Then, we might ask why colorless George Brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero, to be paired with Olivia de Havilland. Among other things, this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it. Even the usually colorful Gabby Hayes, in his small role, seemed unusually subdued. Unfortunately, I fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film. The portion I saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems. It needed to be more like The Good Earth, released just the year before. Just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man, such as Errol Flynn. Finally, there is the matter of the inane title. Surely, Warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title. Gold or Grain is short and to the point. Incidentally, I understand there is still plenty of gold in them thar hills, waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining.","label":0},{"index":1373,"txt":"As a former Kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town I was looking forward to seeing this movie.

The movie also references many pulp scifi novels, serials and films as diverse as The Day The Earth Stood Still, Superman, Metropolis, Planet Of The Apes, The Iron Giant, Star Wars and The Spy Who Loved Me. The film however, fails to be as good as any one of those for several reasons the main being that it is such a labour of love, so concerned with throwing everything at the screen and creating a brave new world, Conran actually forgets about making a movie. There is little to no tension, atmosphere or magic on offer here despite aerial battles, dinosaurs and raceagainsttime setpieces. Even the noir elements fall flat. This is a broad way of looking at things though  those elements mainly fail because nothing feels at all real and is so obviously fake  the greenscreen just looks like a video game half the time and it is obvious the actors have been pasted on afterwards. The actors do not get to do much either  Jude Law is wooden, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie is wasted  and it is all because of an awful script  the sort that has to explain nearly everything.

There were a bunch of weirdo prehistoriclike animals on that island, but they are not explained in any way.The story is horrible beyond belief. In fact I cannot believe I did not just walk out of this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is unmotivated, and throughout the movie is based on distrust and deception. Why is the Morris Paley character even there? We are not in any way convinced that Joe is heroic  I mean he flies a plane, and saved one person Polly for personal reasons. Yeah there is a great hero for you. Dex has very little screen time, so why are we supposed to care about Joe wanting to save him?

Nearly every review of this movie had been positive, the effects looked enticing, the previews convincing.Needless to say, disappointment actually does not describe the feeling I got from this film. It was rage.Beyond being boring and poorly written, the reason this film gets a 2 out of 10 stars is because everything in the film was stolen from another source. I understand the difference between an homage and stealing this was stealing. More importantly, it seems that the filmmakers did not steal to progress a point or move the plot along. They stole just to show that they could. There is literally no point to showing a clip of The Wizard of Oz in a theater at the beginning of the movie except to set up another scene that I will not elaborate on which steals from the same film. Needless to say, every concept in the film was neither original nor even a spin on an old concept it was literally just a rehash of something I had already seen, from pulpera robots reminiscent of the old Superman Cartoons and the recent film The Iron Giant, to the silent martial artist minion of the villain that has been used in countless films, most recognizable in recent years as Darth Maul in Star Wars The Phantom Menace.On the subject of the actual film, most of the performances were completely wooden. Perhaps this is because the entire movie was done on a bluescreen, with computer imagery filling in everything save the actors. Frankly, this is no excuse for poor acting. If a person was ever a child, they understand that a lack of visual reference is no excuse for not trying.Finally, there is no humanity in this film. The protagonists are the only real human beings here. Nearly all the antagonists are robots, and the number of friendly characters that are shown during the film can be counted on one hand. If robots are attacking the entire planet, should not we expect to see masses of humanity running from them? The subpar performance of the main characters prevents us from connecting to, really, anything here.The film was not the worst movie out there, which is why I did not give it a 1.

First off, let me state right off the bat that I sincerely doubt that Paramount will ever recover any money from this film. A cult hit it might become, but only because it is so remarkable for what it failed to achieve. I can see the studio pitch now. Let us combine 1920s German Expressionism and a 1940s globetrotting adventure with a modern action flick and use computer animation to dominate every scene! Wow, will not that be a success!  Skycaptain bludgeons the viewer with its sheer excess. There are too many fake explosions, too many unconvincing dogfight scenes, and too few real moments where the characters are anything but painfully twodimensional. After all, why shock and awe with one floating airship when you can have three, or five, or one hundred?! Moreover, what could have been a groundbreaking film, seamlessly combining computer generated imagery and human actors in a stylized and intriguing setting, will instead become a flop in no small part because it fails to meet the most important requirement of any flick using CGI. Quite simply, the graphics are amazingly poor. From the movement of the cars to the physics of the aircraft in the dogfights, everything seems to be just a little off. I am not being nitpicky here in any way. An infant could notice that a car does not glide along the road like a maglev train unless its a Mercedes S500. And for those of you raising your voices in protest, crying out This is a stylized film, it is not supposed to be like reality, let me just say this. Lord of the Rings has set the standard for integrating reallife actors with CGI, Starship Troopers has set the standard for ironic science fiction films, the Rocketeer did a solid job reintroducing the decade of the 1920s back into the Hollywood film portfolio, and Tim Burtons Batman created a unique picture of New York CityGotham that has yet to be repeated. Sky Captain falls so short of all these films, it is hard for me to mention them in the same sentence. Plus, the acting is so poor, it makes me positively ill. So there you have it.

There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did, so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying it is the greatest movie ever done. It is just crap on a stick. It also did not help that the story line was sooo crappy. I do not understand why Hollywood agreed to have this movie produced, and I also do not understand how actorsactresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this. It is almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print...It will all be done on a computer. This was a movie that should have been on a movie network, because nothing about this movie was revolutionary. I am very upset with myself for paying money to see this. Whatever you do, do not waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.","label":0},{"index":1386,"txt":"A gave it a 2 instead of a 1 awful because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning, a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork. But that was not enough to save it.The sepia toned, washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies. Nothing new there. I can see there were some hattips to other old, classic movies. OK. No problem with that.But a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting, not something that would put you to sleep.The story line and the script of this movie WAS awful, the characters two dimensional. Slow moving. Some of the scenes were pretty to look at, but ultimately, as a whole, it was quite boring, I could not recommend it.","label":0},{"index":1387,"txt":"Visually stunning? Most definitely. I have seen few films look this good in some time. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow uses striking cinematography, computer graphics, and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar yet something quite fresh. The time period seems to be the 1930s or early 40s. The movie tells of recent attacks on New York City by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason. Also, mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide. Who can stop them and save the world? Alright, it does not take a leap of faith to know it is the Sky Captain himself with his wisecracking reporter girlfriend always hot for a lead, and in the wings his trusty, thoroughly competent sidekick. What Sky Captain has in atmosphere and graphics it lacks in storytelling and characterization. The plot for this film is ridiculous. That being said, the film is going for a seriallike feeling of film serials of yesteryear. They had pretty far out stories and bad acting  but none of them, and I mean none of them, had the budget and big names this film had. Two academy award winning performers and Jude Law could keep a film afloat, one would think, but Sky Captain sinks miserably. Despite its fantastic dark look, I found myself wishing the film would just end and I could get on with my life. I had little interest in a story that generated little interest. I did not care at all for any of the glib portrayals. Paltrow was just awful. Jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance. Law cannot carry the oneliner tradition all too squarely on his limited shoulders. I mean, let us face it, he is not Will Smith, Mel Gibson, or even Wesley Snipes. The sad thing about Sky Captain, at least for me, was that it held so much promise yet delivered so little. I was bored ten minutes into the film  waiting for something to hook my interest  and it never came.","label":0},{"index":1388,"txt":"The opening shot was the best thing about this movie, because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate, wellcrafted independent film. Damn that opening shot for filling me hope. As the film progressed in a slow, plodding manner, my thoughts were varied in relation to this film Was there too much butter in my popcorn? Did the actors have to PAY the director to be in this film? Did I get my ticket validated at the Box Office? Yes, dear reader. I saw this film in the Theatre! This would be the only exception I will make about seeing a film at home over a Movie Theatre, because at home you can TURN IT OFF. Were there any redeeming values? Peter Lemongelli as the standard college nerd had his moments, especially in a dog collar. Other than that this film went from trying to be a comedy, to a family drama to a spiritual uplifter. It succeeded on none of these fronts. Oh, and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad. Her performance was the only comedy I found.","label":0},{"index":1389,"txt":"I like the time period, I like the attempt, but watching a movie that looks like I am looking at it through a coke bottle gives me a headache. If I played computer games that were this blurry and out of focus, I would upgrade my computer. Could be that this was the look the director was after, but not so it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I had not taken someone with me to this film, I was out of there. Even though it was a series and not a movie per say, Band of Brothers accomplished this. They made it look like WWII footage, with just a touch of graininess, but it was still a pleasure to watch. Movies need real people, with real sets, and real locations; Use CGI when it is appropriate, not for an entire film.","label":0},{"index":1390,"txt":"Sky Captain is possibly the best awful movie I have seen in a long while. Rife with amazing CG and special effects, studded with an Alist cast Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and the infinitely likable Giovanni Ribisi and racing along with an overused but Indiana Jonesesquire storyline, this should have been a great movie to watch.Should have being the key term here, of course.Jude Law plays Joe the Sky Captain with a dashing accent and plenty of overtheshoulder, heartmelting smirks, but you cannot make something out of nothing, and even his flippant deliveries and boyish good looks cannot save the movies stone dialogue. If he had slapped Giovanni Ribisi on the back and said, Good boy, Dex, just ONE more time, I might have barfed all over the guy in front of me. Gwyneth Paltrow, as Polly Perkins, is nothing less than nerve grating. Her nasal whining and notquitesarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie. Perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical 30s comic book heroine who knows? I expected more from her. An example of how a similar character was played and played well is in the late 90s flick The Phantom, starring Kristy Swanson and Billy Zane. Rent the movie and you will know what I mean.Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie were the saving graces in the film. Angelina Jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch. I will admit it. In just a few short scenes, both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry, twodimensional castmates.The plot and steady story progression were old, boring, and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years. The pace is rapidfire in the first half of the movie, and a snails pace in the second, giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film, but to figure out who the key villain is as well. The pairing is rather clich\u00e9d, also Polly Perkins and Sky Captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterlyended romance, and their story is not so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched. When they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film, nobodys surprised, and nobody really cares either.Props to the director for appreciating Bai Ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film, and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout. But Sky Captain, despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie, falls flat on its face. Not even worth the 2.75 I paid to get into the theater.","label":0},{"index":1391,"txt":"Sky Captain may be considered an homage to comic books, pulp adventures and movie serials but it contains little of the magic of some of the best from those genres. One contributor says that enjoyment of the film depends on whether or not one recognizes the films influences. I do not think this is at all true. Ones expectations of the films,fiction and serials that Captain pays tribute to were entirely different. Especially so for those who experienced those entertainments when they were children. This film is almost completely devoid of the charm and magnetic attraction of those. Of course we know the leads will get into and out of scrapes but there has to be some tension and drama. Toward the climax of Captain Law and Paltrow have ten minutes to prevent catastrophe and by the time they get down to five minutes they are walking not running toward their goal. They take time out for long looks and unnecessary conversation and the contemplation of a fallen foe with 30 seconds left to tragedy. Of course one expects certain conventions to be included but a good director would have kept up some sense of urgency.One does not expect films like this to necessarily make sense. One does expect them to be fun, thrilling and to have some sense of interior logic. Captain has almost none. Remember when Law and Paltrow are being pursued by the winged creatures and they reach a huge chasm which they cross via a log bridge? Well how come they are perfectly safe from those creatures when they reach the other side? They can FLY!!! The chasm itself means nothing to them. The bridge is unnecessary for them so where is the escape? If the land across the chasm is forbidden to the flying creatures the film made no effort to let us know how or why or even if.I know that Paltrow and Law both of whom have given fine performances in the past were playing types but both were pretty flat. Only Giovanni Ribisi who showed himself capable of great nuance here and Angelina Jolie seemed to give any oomph to their roles although Omid Djalili seemed like he could have handled a little more if he would only been given the chance. He did a pretty good job anyway considering how he was basically wasted.The film had a great look but there are so many ways in which CGI distracts. CGI works best when it is used for the fantastical, when it is used to create creatures who do not exist in nature or for scientific or magical spectacular. When it is used to substitute for natural locations it disappoints. There is no real sense of wonder. A CGI mountain does not have any of the stateliness or sense of awe and foreboding that a real mountain does. I know that the design of this film was quite deliberate and it was not necessarily supposed to LOOK real but should not it FEEL that way? It just did not. As for the weak and clich\u00e9d script...homage is no excuse. Even so, had the movie had some thrills and dramatic tension it might still have been enjoyable. The Last Samurai was as predictable as the days of the week and I am no fan of Tom Cruise but it had everything that Captain did not most notably it drew the viewer into its world and made us accept its rules and way of being in a way that Sky Captain most definitely did not.I would like to see a similar approach taken for films about comic book heroes of the 30s and 40s. The original Jay Garrick Flash or Green Lantern Alan Scott come to mind as being ripe for such treatment. Maybe the better, more well known and fully realized characters that those character are would make for a much better film. It would be hard to be worse.","label":0},{"index":1392,"txt":"Visually interesting, but falls flat in the originality department. This tedious excercise in technique wears thin after the opening battle. Jude Law has the charisma of burnt toast, but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogue I have ever seen on the big screen. In fact the script is so poor that it keeps taking you out of the film, and had me thinking about work, bills, my dogs, etc. There are many moments that scream bluescreen. Paltrow is as wooden as they get. This could of been saved by snappy film noir dialogue or over the top camp. My only complaint on the technique is that Black  White film sorry, computer would of helped because it looks like Turner colorized black and white. Just a big dull clich\u00e9 mess. I would rather break my femur than sit through this endurance test again.","label":0},{"index":1393,"txt":"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow an amazingly incovenient title is simply a bad movie; it has no heart, no deep ideas, nothing very special about it. Yes, the CGI backgrounds look interesting, but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus. Additionally, the movie uses music the same way as, say, Gilligans Island or the ScoobyDoo cartoons IT NEVER STOPS. Terribly, simply terrible. There are no fresh ideas, either, just gobs and gobs and gobs and... etc., of bits taken from older movies and serials. There is no gatekeeper here, the movie just seems to exist because it can. Save your money and your time. Not entertaining at all.","label":0},{"index":1394,"txt":"In a word, this film was boring. It lacked life and spark. A big problem is with the two leads. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever. He was boring, and she was annoying. The visuals were interesting, but they did not enhance the scenes. If anything, the visuals tended to detach the audience from what was happening on screen. None of the action sequences felt real, and hence, the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger.The film had potential, but it needed a better script, better acting, and a better director. I kept thinking during the film, you know, this movie would have worked if Harrison Ford was Sky Captain, Karen Allen was Polly, and Steven Spielberg was the director. Ignore the critical acclaims for this film. The critics I think are praising the film because they want to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels.","label":0},{"index":1395,"txt":"What a waste of time!

I love scifi, the old cliffhangers, and I can appreciate the attempt at nods to Flash Gordon, and Metropolis, but my God, what a waste of money. I used to work for Paramount Pictures, and I had written Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests. She told me they would never have an interest or need to do it. 10 years later, Paramount releases this piece of crap. Sherry was right in 1993, but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog. Blue screen an effect shot, but not an entire movie. Let us not forget, neither Jude nor Jolie are terrific actors but easy on the eyes. Paltrows performance reminds me of a high school effort.

However, it is obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie, he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinnedplotted film. SPOILER For crying out loud, they forgot to have a villain in this thing! OK they have one, but he is been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place. Conran misses the point of HAVING a villain. As far as action goes, well let us see, Sky Captain Law shoots down ONE robot, two or three of the flapping wing airplanes before Dex Ribisi tells him to stop shooting them down!!!, and a couple robots, but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him. Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie the reviewer who comments on hers and Laws lack of chemistry is so right and I for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera, showing she ONLY HAS TWO SHOTS LEFT, both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie, one uncomically, one quite funny, although I saw it coming from 70 years away. No one except Law and Paltrow have any significant time on screen, and that is the movies real flaw. An audience does not identify with robots, they need a hero to root for, and a visible, despicable villain to hate.

Looking at it today it is hard to imagine how it ever got made, uniting a cast that was briefly considered the cream of Cool Britannias Lads Mags Brigade \u0096 Rhys Ifans, Sadie Frost, Nick Moran and Joseph Fiennes \u0096 but now merely a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confused adaptation of a confused James Hawes novel. That the plot is never explained could be down to the possibility that noone really knows what it is, or perhaps simply do not think it matters. Something to do with Ifans businessman being set up with Steven Berkoffs homicidal Russian crime lord in a moneylaundering or investment scheme it is never clear which because noone ever asks by Fiennes crooked Irish accountant, who expects the Russians to kill off Ifans so he can take over his failing company. Things get increasingly confused and underexplained from there on, Ifans alternates between shouting about how terrible his life is while juggling visits to the fertility clinic and sleeping with his secretary and Tara Fitzgeralds ludicrously accented Russian temptress, Berkoff keeps on saying Bizniss and Francis Drake and Fiennes does a decent Irish accent while proving that just because he played a great writer in Shakespeare in Love does not mean he is any judge of good writing when it comes to film scripts.When the most convincing performances come from Keith Allen and Dani Behr, you know a film is in deep trouble. With Poland standing in for a Russia filled with people with Polish accents and a strange score that veers from John Barry pastiche to lounge music to Ennio Morricone spaghetti Western on a stylophone budget, it fails completely in the cool stakes it is aiming for and ends up in a curious overplotted but almost plot less limbo all its own, sitting there like a joke shop dog turd.","label":0},{"index":1425,"txt":"I felt Rancid Aluminium was a complete waste of two hours, the plot line was thin and confusing, the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents.

One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminium is the over use of narration throughout the film almost like the entire plot is being dictated to the audience. The best performances were not anything to do with acting. In fact probably the most convincing performance came from Dani Behr of all people, although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary.

Its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so selfevidently a bad thing that it barely needs to convince the audience of it. When it does stoop to putting in its argument, it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts ; all that is missing is someone crying when is someone going to think of the children!. While watching this movie, I kept thinking where did you hear that? or that cannot possibly be true  yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources. And bless em, the regular folks in the movie came across more like Luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and cons of nuclear power; to be fair, that might be the fault of the filmmakers, but equally fairly, it is a condition shared by the movies rock stars.As for the performers........... Now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music I have enjoyed, and I am sure a few of them really did believe in this cause. But they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over, now that the 60s have passed them by. Particularly embarrassing are Graham Nash and James Taylor. Nash seems to be trying too hard  he looks like he cannot possibly believe the things he is being told not that I blame him, but desperate to feel noticed and included. James Taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest anthem ever, Stand and Fight, in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine. In fact, most of the performances are pretty bland when they are not being patronizing. Nobody seems worked up by this event, as if it really does not mean much to them at all. It is worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be John Hall, of the band Orleans, and responsible for some of the wimpiest MOR pop of the 70s. Remember, if you dare, Dance With Me and Still the One. It is worth noting because that is symbolic of how the cause here fails to inspire any real passion in the music. The cause is supposedly lifeordeath, but everybody sleepwalks through their numbers like they are playing the Catskills. Except maybe GilScott Heron  his protest number We Almost Lost Detroit is on topic at least, but delivered with all the smugness of a highschooler impressed with how controversial he is being.Only Bruce Springsteens performance raises a pulse; I have never been a big fan of the Boss, but he absolutely smokes, no question. Part of me thinks he was taped separately, at another event, and edited into this movie to give wake the audience. Compared to the general blandness and air of selfsatisfaction here, it is no wonder Bruce was hailed as the savior of rocknroll.But even his performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting. I do not expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a 70s film, but the shots are unnecessarily static, broken up only by splitsecond cutaways to a backup singers tonsils. Now, some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with; and maybe the filmmakers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage  but all you have to do is watch Rust Never Sleeps or The Last Waltz to see a movie like this done with more skill. And with more exciting musicians.

Disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to fathom how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear their name.Technically, the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds overdubbed and unnatural. Personally I hate that, but it was doubly awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a 12 year old for a school project.

You remember this famous Conditioned Reflex experiment from your school books, right? The Russian scientist Pavlov proved that dogs tended to salivate before the food actually came into their mouths and this through repetitive routines stimulating the animals reflexes. Pavlov rung a bell a couple of instants before the food was delivered to the dog and, after a while, he became anxious and excited and already started salivating from hearing the sound of the bell. What the hell has this whole boring explanation in common with a sleazy and lowbudgeted Aussie slasher flick, I hear you think? Well, the modus operandi of the maniacal killer in Nightmares is an exact variant on Pavlovs experiment. Each and every single murder sequence is preceded by the raw sound and image of the killer breaking a window, because heshe insists on using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims. So this means that, after a short while, inattentive and bored viewers can afford to doze off and simply look up again when they hear the sound of shattering glass. That way they still do not miss anything special! Regarding the quality of Nightmares as a film I can be very brief. This is a cheap, uninspired and largely imbecilic Aussie cashin on the contemporary popular trend of American slasher movies. In the early 60s, a fouryearold witnesses the cruel death of her mother as her throat gets slit open in a nasty car accident. Twenty years later the same girl \u0096 Helen Selleck \u0096 is a successful stage actress, but she still has severe mental issues and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks and traumatic nightmares. She auditions for a role in a black comedy play revolving on death and gets the part. Shortly after the big premiere, everyone who is even remotely involved with the production gets slaughtered. It is truly retarded how this movie attempts to uphold the mystery regarding the killers identity and motivations even though even the most infantile viewer can figure it out after the first murder already. I do not think I have ever seen a more obvious whodunit than Nightmares and the creators should have just showed hisher face straight away and save themselves from embarrassment. The murders are explicit and very bloody and there is also an unhealthy large amount of gratuitous nudity to enjoy. However, the production values are poor and thus the movie is never at one point shocking or provocative. The few clips we get to see of the actual play make it appear that it quite possible could be the worst thing ever performed on stage. The only positive elements in the film are the characters of the director and the gay newspaper critic, whom are both delightfully sarcastic and insult the rest of the cast members as much as we do.

If you did not know that already, then I believe you are a moron. But let us assume that none of us are morons. We all know that animals have emotions, and we now want to see how these emotions are manifest in nature, correct?What we get instead is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that attempts to show how animals are human. The filmmakers search high  low for footage of animals engaged in humanlike behaviour, and when it happens they say, That monkey is almost human! that is actually a direct quote.Everything is in human terms. They waste time theorizing about what makes dogs smile, but not once do they mention what a wagging tail means. The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. They even go so far as to show chimpanzees dressed in human clothing and wearing a cowboy hat.I had been expecting an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms. I wanted to learn how animals emote in their OWN languages. But instead, researchers keep falling back on pedantic, anthropomorphic observations and assumptions. Add a cheezy soundtrack and images of chimps celebrating Christmas, and this was enough to turn my stomach.But it does not end there. Half of this documentary is filmed not in the wild but in laboratories and experimental facilities. All the camera shots of chimps are through steel bars, and we see how these monkeys are crowded together in their sterile concrete cages. One particularly sobering moment happens near the beginning though you have to be quick to notice it where a captive monkey says in sign language, Want out. Hurry go.Obscure references are made to stress tests and psychological experiments which I shudder to imagine. Baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and are given wireframe dolls in order to prove that baby monkeys crave a mother figure. And after 40 years of experiments, the smug researchers pat themselves on the back for reaching their brilliant conclusion monkeys have emotions.One chimp named Washoe has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for that purpose, and to this day she remains thus.

There is no timing at all in that movie. I felt like the directors were so exited to do that movie it is their first feature, that they actually never really asked themselves, what story they wanna tell.

Aside from predictability of the plot, some scenes in the film felt really out of place with the storyline ex. a certain event at the wedding. At times the film was a bit preachy in it is ideas and in relation to the Franco era the film was set in and the Church.

The investigation and building of the case are handed over to the DAs office, where Ally Sheedy and Eric Stoltz are put in charge.Rumors about the case spread through Glen Ridge, an uppermiddleclass suburb where the jocks are adored by everyone in the community. One of their fathers is a police lieutenant. Nobody believes Matarazzo. Our boys would never take a slut like that down to the basement, rape her, and subject her to such sexual humiliation. The question is whether Sheedy and Stoltz will ever be able to shape a sufficiently cogent case that they can bring the jocks to trial. Matarazzo is not an ideal plaintiff. She is desperate for love and friendship, and that makes it easy for faux friends to mislead her into making false statements. A slimy reporter says, You can trust me, but it turns out the reporter cannot be trusted at all. Another student, a very popular girl in school, pulls a Linda Tripp on Matarazzo, pretending to be her bosom buddy but all the while asking her leading questions about the incident  and taping the results! As a consequence, watching this story unfold is like being on a roller coaster. At first it looks like a good case for Sheedy and Stoltz. But then, oops, the community organizes against the law. Then it looks good again. But then the reporter interferes. Then that obstacle is no sooner overcome, than Linda Tripp pokes her big nose into the investigation and makes public the tapes that seem to indicate Matarazzo was lying. Well, actually, she WAS lying  but she was lying to her interrogator in order to please her. Then that is overcome, but Matarazzo objects to taking the stand because she does not want to be characterized as retarded. Eric Stoltz is fine in the part of the prosecutor. I say that for the simple reason that he and I lived in Pago Pago around the same time. I hope he was not the kid I had that altercation with at the bar of the Seaside Club. If he was, I take back my compliment. Ally Sheedy is a strange actress and hard to characterize. She did a marvelous selfrestrained job in Fine Art but I did not sense any particular effort being put into this role, which was rather formulaic anyway. I mean, neither she nor Stoltz nor anyone else could give a bravura performance in what is essentially a comic book story.The producers and director had the good sense to choose Heather Matarazzo for the role of victim. The very worst thing they could have done is cast an ethereally lovely, neotenous blond. Instead, Matarazzo, without being at all ugly, looks rather plain and this ordinary quality is complemented by her grooming and make up. Nor have the writers turned her wistful and gentle. She has a temper and is sometimes irritating to listen to, which is all for the good.Matarazzos character is the best drawn in the film. The jocks are stereotypes. Pure evil. They think themselves above the law, barge in on some nice girls party in East Orange, trash the place during a party far worse than La Dolce Vitas climactic orgy, and leave without explanation or apology. They deserve to get it in the neck  and they do.I referred to this as a comic book story and that is pretty much what it is. It challenges none of our prejudices. It reaffirms out belief that the world can be divided into Good and Evil. And we do not have a moments doubt about who is who. What I am waiting for  not really, that is just rhetorical  is a movie almost exactly like this one and a dozen others, but in which the victim is LYING in order to get her name and photo in the papers and garner all those sympathy chips from rightthinking folk like the rest of us.The film is based on a true story, as are so many others we have all seen, and even more fictional features. Eg., The Accused. Some are good, some are strictly routine. Okay. Fair enough. Now when do we get to see a film about the Tawana Brawley case, in which the teenaged girl disappeared on a whim for a few days, then had her friends strip her, tie her up, and smear her with dirt, so she could claim she would been abducted and raped by the police?

It takes some time to really get into his mojo, but once you see the clear message and the ability to tell the story that is close to his heart, Lee is a genius. Unlike The 25th Hour or Bamboozled two of my favorite films of his, there was no clear story in this film. I was able to understand the struggle between Washington and the choice to play well or be influenced by others, but for some odd reason Lee was never able to get the true feeling out. Washington did a decent job with what was handed to him, but you could tell that this was not Lees favorite film. Not only did Lee direct this film, but he also wrote it. You could tell. The camera work was horrid and the writing only contributed to the decay of the film. This film was coming full circle and it was not going to be pretty. Lee was not 100 behind this film as he was with Do the Right Thing. Of all the films I have seen Lee direct, this was the brightest and more modest of his films. It was almost as if he created a Hollywood movie instead of one that was all his own. I do not know if he saw the money from Do the Right Thing and ran with it, or what \u0085 but this film did not demonstrate his true talent.For anyone out there that has seen this film, and perhaps stopped watching anything directed by Spike Lee afterwards due to this film, I suggest you give him a second chance. Do not get me wrong, I see exactly where you are coming from with this film and why you would want to put this behind you, but Lee does grow up. His work becomes more of his own, and you can see the transformation from a desire to make money to just wanting to make good films. It took me awhile to watch The 25th Hour, but when I did, it was sheer brilliance. Perhaps it was the actors, perhaps the story, but Lee crafted an amazing film out of one mans journey into the unknown. I guess that is what I was hoping Mo Better Blues would turn out to be. This really dark journey into the life of a man that really never grew up, but instead all I got was Denzel being Denzel. He really is one of the most versatile actors of this generation, and I do consider him the Sydney Poitier of cinema, but this was not the film to showcase his talent.Another issue that I had with this film was the use of Spikes sister playing one of the love interests. I do not know about you, and your family, but I do not think that I could have filmed a sex scene with my sister. I do not care who the actor is or how much money I am getting paid, I would never do it. It is just something that I never wish to see, but apparently that is different for Spike. He went ahead and showed the full nude image of his sister without any remorse. It was sad and it even made me blush. Also, I need somebody to answer me this. What was Flavor Flav doing introducing this film? So, I am sitting there on my couch, ready to start the film, when suddenly there is a voice from the past spelling out the studio that made this film, then he acknowledges himself. That did not build for a strong remaining of the story. Again, I felt that Lee was going for money on this film instead of actual talent. Perhaps that is how he could afford both Denzel and Wesley in the same movie without any explosions.There were two great scenes in this film that made it worth watching through to the end. Do not get me wrong, this was a very bad movie, but there is always a diamond in every alleyway. The scene when Bleek accidentally forgets which woman he is with was mesmerizing. He continually went back and forth, weaving truth to confusion in a way that proved that Lee was actually behind the camera. It was a visionary scene that was probably lost in the shuffle due to the remaining poor scenes. The other scene that was worth watching was the way that Lee introduced and ended the film. By keeping the same pacing and direction, he was able to bring this tragic character around full circle and give him the chance to change his life. Other than these two moments, the rest of the film was pure rubbish, not worth viewing unless you are about to go blind.Grade  out of ","label":0},{"index":1486,"txt":"Things get dull early an often in this in this mawkish jazz bio fiction written and directed by Spike Lee.Bleek Gilliam Denzell Washington is a happenin jazz trumpeter that fronts a quintet packing them in at Below the Underdog. His problems include an incompetent manager, a stage hogging sax player and two girlfriends that he is playing musical mattress with. The real love of his life though is his trumpet and his music. The bands manager, Giant, has a dangerous gambling problem and proves to be an ineffective negotiator with greedy club owners and would be best jettisoned but Bleek remains loyal for as long as possible. It will prove to his undoing as an artist but ironically contribute to his growth as a man.As Bleek, Denzell Washington is all wrong as the ambitious trumpeter with a babe on each arm. He is too sweet a guy to be so self centered about his art, dispensing patience and love to those close to him with a low key remoteness. He simply lacks the fire. Wesley Snipes who plays Henderson the sax player would have been far more suited for the role but even he would have to mouth the flaccid throw away scribblings of Lees torpid dialogue. As Giant, Lee hits the trifecta with an abysmal performance to match his writing and direction. Loosely attempting to mirror the grubby but sympathetic Ratso Rizzo to Bleeks Joe Buck he adopts a limp and even the I am walkin here moment from Midnight Cowboy. In this case you wish the taxi would run him over and be done with it.Lees script is all tepid argument, heavy handed ribbing and veiled insult with some requisite clumsy editorializing that Lee has to inject to remain down. The scenes between the band members backstage and in rehearsal lack spark and are only surpassed in dreariness by the Bleek, Giant conversations that have an ad lib look and go in circles. Completing this travesty is Lees pretentious visual style. Tracking shots, zooms and pans are wasted and without significance to scenes. They just wander.Blues is Lees love letter to jazz made implicit by the mountains of memorabilia plastered all over the sets and it is all sentimental clap trap that lacks passion and verve. Jazz on film is better served by Taverniers Round Midnight and Eastwoods Bird which get below the surface, reveal more sides of the form, the pain behind it in addition to offering infinitely superior lead performances by Forrest Whitaker and the real deal Dexter Gordon. This Spike Lee Joint does not even offer a mild buzz.

While I will admit that I have really enjoyed some of his films, I can also honestly say that I cannot stand some of them. My opinion, by the way, is not just some kneejerk reactionI have seen most of Fellinis films and have also seen many films by the worlds most famous directors. With this in mind, I feel that the most overrated and annoying directors can be both Godard and Fellini. They both have delighted in the bizarre and often unwatchable and yet have received gobs of accolades from reviewers and the intelligensia, while the average person would never sit through some of their films. Heck, even a person who loves international cinema would generally be left out in the cold when seeing some of these films. So, since only a small clique actually watches their films and they are already predisposed to seeing the directors as geniuses, it is not surprising that their films are so often praisedit is like a cult! If you do not believe me, think about many of Godards films such as FIRST NAME CARMEN or ALPHAVILLE,...or what about FELLINI SATYRICON or JULIET OF THE SPIRITS? These films abound with boredom, weirdness and incomprehensibility. Now I am NOT saying a film cannot be weird after all I love HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS and SHAOLIN SOCCER, but it must be watchable!Now on to this movie. Somehow, Fellini has managed to make a story about a sexually compulsive man completely boring and unsexy. This is no small taskit took a lot of work to make this so unwatchable. Instead of cheap sexual thrills, the sex acts are choreographed in a silly and annoying way while the character of Casanova is buried under so much makeup and prosthetics that Donald Sutherland looks like a ghoul. I know some of this must have been Fellinis intention, but many viewers will be left completely bored by this sterile performanceespecially since Sutherlands lines are all poorly dubbed into Italian and so he neither looks nor sounds like himself! Unfortunately, when the movie is not wrapped up in these boring sexual escapades, there really is not anything else to watch.An interesting note about the first sexual conquest shown in this dull movie is that the actress looks amazingly like a younger version of Fellinis wife, Giulietta Masina. Considering that in addition to this, that in previous decades Fellini had Masina play characters such as a prostitute and a horribly abused woman, it seems like he may have truly hated his wife and was having this acted out on screen. I read a bit about them and their tempestuous relationship and it seems to bear this out as well. This is about the only aspect of this turgid film that I found at all interesting.

A lot of the scenes work in a plugandplay manner inserted strictly to conform to the romanticcomedy genre.

This movie fails to do so.There is no sense of who the characters really are, apart from Sylvie Moreaus who is the real star of this movie, not Isabelle Blais. They fit into this onedimensional clich\u00e9 and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrative.The pacing of the movie can become annoying, rhythm lacks, and the editing is filled with unnecessary closeups. I should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally, or rather, making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious. Of course, along with that, you have the rightoncue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatched.I cannot believe that a movie who makes obvious Woody Allen allusions ends up being this deceptive. If you expect a good lighthearted romantic comedy, this is not it. Or rather, this a poor attempt at it. You will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are far superior Quebecois directors making better flicks.Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is.

The art direction and costume design are however OUTSTANDING. The Academy missed on not even nominating the former but did itself justice by rewarding an OSCAR for the latter.

As far as I could make it out, this is the position Fellini takes regarding his subject; granted, with more empathy, but disgusted nonetheless.Casanovas environment is made from decay and incestuous behavior, themes Fellini dealt with more pointedly in Satyricon. The succession of plot is characteristic of soft porn, just without the coherence; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distraction.Yet, there might just be a point in portraying Casanova as an unsightly fool. And I challenge anybody to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini could not.

Unfortunately, that is not saying much.It has a competent cast of secondrankers that acquit themselves as well as could be expected under the circumstances. It is efficiently directed, entirely on sound stages and standing sets on the studio backlot. It looks OK, but is ponderously overplotted and at a scant 80 minutes it is still heavily padded.For example, the double cobra attack on the first of the GIs was surely one attack too many.The business about Julia choosing to marry Pete rather than Tom never amounts to anything. Tom immediately falls in love with Lisa and she never has any reason to be jealous of Julia nor is she.Julias feminine intuition is introduced as if it is going to lead to an important plot development, but it does not. Similarly, Petes investigation into cobra cults and the suspicion that briefly falls on Tom serve no purpose other than to fill up screen time.These are just symptoms of the underlying problem. The movie is structured like a mystery but it is not. As soon as the curse is pronounced we know exactly where the story is heading, so the characters are left painstakingly uncovering what we already know.The ending is particularly lame. Julia is menaced purely by accident. Lisa has no reason to want to kill her  she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. When Tom turns up in the nick of time to save her, it is not even clear whether she was threatened at all. He then simply disposes of the cobra in the way any of the previous victims might have done.It is such an inconsequential little pipsqueak of a story that I found myself wondering how on earth it had been pitched to the studio heads. Then it occurred to me. Someone said Those Val Lewton movies were very successful over at RKO, so why do not we make one like that?Cult of the Cobra is clearly modelled on Cat People mysterious, troubled, shapeshifting woman falls in love with the hero, is apparently frigid, kills people, arouses the suspicions of the heros woman friend and dies at the end. But modelled on does not mean as good as  by a wide margin. It copies, but does not understand what it is copying.It is obviously trying for the lowkey, suggestive Lewton style, but this approach does not follow through into the story. Lisa is no Irene. She is meant to be strange and mysterious but there is no mystery about her. We get a glimpse of her after the first attack in Asia, so immediately recognise her when she turns up in New York. There is never any doubt about her purpose. Neither is there any ambiguity about whether of not she actually turns into a snake.Then again, during her nocturnal prowling we get, not one, but two attempts at buses. Neither come off, because the director does not understand what makes a bus work and, in any case, they happen to the stalker, not the person being stalked.These faint echoes of Cat People give Cult of the Cobra whatever small distinction it might have, but they only draw attention to the yawning gulf between the original and the imitation.Plagiarism may be the sincerest form of flattery, but I doubt if Lewton or Tourneur were particularly flattered when this tepid little timepasser came out.","label":0},{"index":1497,"txt":"Six GIs, about to be send home and discharged, get drunk and sneak into a cult meeting in Asia. Surrounded by hooded figures, two male dancers pretend to have a fight. Behind them, on an altar, a woven basket opens and a figure painted emerges and begins imitating a snake, finally biting one of the dancers on the neck. The imitation snake is dressed in some scaley looking body tights. This is definitely a female imitation snake. The cult member who has sneaked them into the secret meeting has warned the six men repeatedly that the ceremonies must not be interrupted and, most definitely, no photos must be taken or else they will be hunted down and killed. Naturally, the GIs take a flash photo, send the cult members into an angry hysteria, steal the basket containing the snake and run off with it into the Asian night.One of the guys, the most offensive and snarky, dies from a cobra bite on the neck, though no one can explain how the snake got into his hospital room.Back in New York, it all seems rather old news as the discharged men settle down into their civilian lives, still maintaining their bond with one another. Their jobs range from manager of a bowling alley David Janssen to graduate research student Richard Long. James Dobson, Jack Kelly, and Marshall Thompson are also part of the neighborhood. Richard Long has a nice blond girl friend. Kelly is a somewhat reckless womanizer. But they all get along well enough and all of them seem happy.Then a dark, shiftylooking, mysterious woman Faith Domergue shows up and Marshall Thompson takes a liking to her and insinuates her into the group.Guess what happens. First Janssen is terrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car crash. Then Kelly gets a visit from Domergue. Something scares him so badly he tumbles through the window and dies in the fall to the sidewalk. Long and Dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows  that Domergue has had something to do with the deaths. They also reckon that maybe she is turning into a cobra, which is the case. Dobson confronts her with his suspicions and she proves his point.By this time Long and Thompson are thoroughly frazzled, particularly Thompson, who is in love with Domergue and has discovered that she is attracted to him, too, although he must explain to her what love is. No matter. A final reckless attack by the cobra woman against Longs girl friend  not one of the six original offenders  and Thompson must throw the snake out the window. On the pavement below, the body changes to that of Domergue. The end.I think I will skip over most of the questions that the plot raises. I will just mention one of the more prosaic ones in passing. Who paid for Domergues fare from somewhere in Asia to New York? Who is paying her utility bills in the hotel? Who paid for her spectacular wardrobe? How come she speaks American English so well? What the hells going on? The writers and director have clearly seen some of Val Lewtons modest horror films and, though not much effort has gone into this production, they have unashamedly stolen some gimmicks from Lewton. In Lewtons The Cat People, for instance, the woman is transformed into a black leopard but, with one tiny exception, the threat is always kept in the shadows and is all the more spooky for it. Most of the transformations here use shadows too, but unlike Lewtons, the shadows are clumsy and unambiguous.Lewton also made occasional use of what he called buses. Lewtons first bus was a literal one. A potential victim is hurrying alone through the dark tunnels of Central Park with only the sound of footsteps. Something or someone is following her. She freezes with fright under a street lamp. Something rustles the branches of the shrubs above her. She looks upward. There is a loud, wheezing shriek that makes your hair stand on end. It is a bus using its air brakes to stop for her. The producers used at least two buses in this film and they amount to nothing. A guy is walking distractedly across an intersection, for instance, and there is the sudden rumble of a truck that almost hits him. There is no set up to the shot. It is jammed in with a shoe horn.I do not much care for movies that perpetuate the stereotype of serpents as slimy, ugly, venomous, and phallic. As a matter of fact, no snakes are slimy, most are harmless, and many are extraordinarily beautiful. Furthermore, they are more feminine than masculine in their sinuous movements and serpentine approach to goals. You want a reptilian symbol for masculinity? Try a sixlined racerunner. It is a really fast lizard. When it sees something to eat, it rushes up and gobbles it down.Anyway, if you want to see some fine, lowbudget scary films, do not bother with this one. Find The Cat People or one of Lewtons other minor masterpieces, of which this is an obvious copy.","label":0},{"index":1498,"txt":"Actually, this is a lie, Shrek 3D was actually the first 3d animated movie.

Also, Shrek 3d was a motion simulator at Universal Studios. They should still consider it as a movie, because it appeared in a theater and you could buy it for DVD.

It is a terrible shame, however, that this surge in quality has led the majority of Danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism. In fact, it has become so bad that I no longer trust any reviews of Danish movies, and as a result I have stopped watching them in theaters.I know it is wrong to hold this unfortunate development against any one movie, so let me stress that Villa Paranoia would be a terrible film under any circumstances. The fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with Danish film. Furthermore, waiting until it came out on DVD was very little help against the unshakable feeling of having wasted time and money. Erik Clausen is an accomplished director with a knack for social realism in Copenhagen settings. I particularly enjoyed De Frigjorte 1993. As an actor he is usually funny, though he generally plays the same role in all of his movies, namely that of a workingclass slob who is down on his luck, partly because he is a slob but mostly because of society, and who redeems himself by doing something good for his community. This is problem number one in Villa Paranoia; Clausen casts himself as a chicken farmer, which is such a break from the norm that he never succeeds in making it credible. It is much worse, however, that the film has to make twists and turns and break all rules of how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on. For instance, the movie opens with a very sad attempt at visualizing the neardeath experience of the main character with the use of lowbudget effects and bad camera work. After that, the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to throw herself off a bridge. This is symptomatic of the whole movie; there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters, and Clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating whatever motivation there is Telling instead of showing. Thus, at one point, you have a character talking out loud to a purportedly catatonic person about the way he feels, because the script would not allow him to act out his feelings; and later on, voiceover is abruptly introduced, quite possibly as an afterthought, to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the directors ineptitude. Fortunately, at this point you are roughly an hour past caring about any of the characters, let alone the socalled story.The acting, which has frequently been a problem in Clausens movies, can be summed up in one sad statement S\u00f8ren Westerberg Bentsen, whose only other claim to stardom was as a contestant on Big Brother, is no worse than several of the heralded actors in the cast.I give this a 2outof10 rating.","label":0},{"index":1500,"txt":"As long as there is been 3d technology, 1950s I think there is been animation made for it.

However, I could see that there really was not any scenes which took advantage of the 3D effects except a fight between characters near the end.

The flies were an unusual bluegray that was kind of distracting to me.The performances from the cast was not bad, but it was not good either. There were many times I focused more on my computer than the story. The writing was certainly written for a younger audience, with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh. I saw nothing for adults, like jokes that they will get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning.History was not followed in this film. In fact, I think it was completely ignored, as the main focus was the flies.

This documentary has so many problems that I hardly know what to say. I am not a Muslim, nor am I an Islamic studies expert, but I know enough to shed some light on the obvious onesided viewpoint that this documentary espouses. The problems with this movie begin with the fact that it is a documentary. Most of the documentaries that I have seen anchor themselves around a few valid points and then surround those points with debatable interpretations and misinformation. This is certainly the case with Islam What the West Needs to Know. Yes, there are fundamentalists around the world, and some of them are Muslim, but to build a documentary about all of Islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading. This is really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing more.For those who would like to more objectively explore some of the issues raised in this documentary, here are several points that may help. There was nothing positive about Islam presented in the documentary.The documentary focuses on the Middle East, but more Muslims live outside of that region. More Muslims live in China, believe it or not, than in Saudi Arabia. About 40 of all Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia.The translation of the Quran used in the documentary is a questionable one. I watched the documentary while viewing another translation and the differences were striking. I had been warned about the translation that was used in the documentary and now I know why. Surrah 986 is a good example. The documentary suggests that the Surrah says that disbelievers will go to hell. But the translation I have reads instead Those who reject Truth among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists will be in hellfire. The difference is that those who reject Truth are those people who know about God and the Truth of God and decide to reject it anyways. The movie mentioned that there is no morality inherent in Islam, but this is not true. Although it is true that much comes from the Quran and Hadith, Islam also recognizes a concept called Urf or normative behavior. Obviously what is normative can be interpreted many ways, but Urf is meant to be good behavior, what an average person would consider right or wrong.The documentary presents Sharia Islamic Law as being one unified body of knowledge that all Muslims follow. This is simply not true. There are many Islamic schools of law and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret law. The Hadith tradition is similar. There are thousands of Hadith and each school of law accepts some and rejects others. Using the Hadith without serious scholarship to determine which ones are accurate, real and applicable, is indiscriminately picking and choosing quotations from history that fit what you want to say\u0085 which is what the documentary did.What I hope people realize is that fundamentalism is the problem, not Islam or any other religion. Christianity has fundamentalists that shoot abortion clinic doctors and so on. I know this is not the same as suicide bombing, just understand that the righteousness of fundamentalism is arguably the problem. If you feel you have THE answer, then everyone else must be wrong. But if you feel you have AN answer you can work together with other peoples views about politics, religion, God, or whatever.","label":0},{"index":1525,"txt":"It is not obvious from viewing this film so I recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it but this presentation on the realities of Islam, and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all nonMuslims is lacking objectiveness, and also completely fails to factor in the human condition. It is one thing to document that the Koran says many things about how a devout Muslim is required to interact with nonMuslims, but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of Islam, will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system. There is reason to call much about the presenters into question, such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism; do not swallow it all, hook, line, and sinker, without some thinking of your own.One specific, for instance, is researching the person Walid Shoebat; who claims to be a former Muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in Bethlehem. There are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions. I am not nor have I ever been a Muslim. I have never read the Koran. I am not a Christian, nor a member of _any_ faith. But I am an intelligent and discerning human. While the film is quite disturbing, in its presentation of how SOME Muslims view their obligation to Islam; I remind you that there is more to Islam than the views of the fundamentalists. Just as their are fundamentalists and evangelical Christians, so, too, there are variations in the intensity of belief and obligation among Jews and Muslims.When you watch this film, you need to have the salt shaker on hand. One grain will not be enough, you will need more. Please use your own mind and think for yourself, research what is presented, and evaluate the state of the world and how Islam fits within it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video.

Green, who is constantly rejected by Los Angeles casting agents for being obsolete i.e. too New York when the 80s is looking for big, blonde, and dumb, he finds success comes easily when he is willing to succumb to falsifying his image. Unfortunately, the new hair dye and pacified surfer attitude lands him an acting opportunity with the Jericho Church, which subscribes white supremacist teaching of the Aryan nation. Green is willing to easily forget his past, and particularly turning his back on his young black friend of ten years, in order to be the Churchs new spokesman. This makes no sense, seeing as how principled our character initially is. It is this sudden, and loose change in character, coupled with an abrupt reversion back to the hardened, DeNiroobsessed as his Taxi Driver character form who is able to battle the villains. A noble attempt on the filmmakers, but one that ultimately reveals itself as anything but serious.The other characters, too, are quite annoying and what we are forced to recognize in them comes too easily  the psychotic paranoia of the Church leader, the selfinterested actress girlfriend the first girlfriend Bronson has when he is in L.A., and the new blonde girlfriend who is character lacks so much development, she is, for the most part, just a walking, talking void. We are just supposed to see them in fleeting moments in which something random forces us to draw assumptions about the characters. But there is really little development of any of them.The other problem with this film is the ungodly amount of time the characters are involved in very little important action. Much of the beginning concerns introducing the characters, obviously, and later we see Bronsons difficulties with breaking into the L.A. acting scene and the frustrations which stem from constant rejection. But after he does willingly change his looks and personality in order to become accepted, there is at least a good twenty minutes to thirty minutes of wasted film in which very little of anything happens.For films that seek to draw attention to the irrational fears behind racism, this was not one done with enough credibility.","label":0},{"index":1529,"txt":"ok. for starters, taxi driver is amazing. this, this is not taxi driver or amazing. what it is is bad. but i thought it was bad funny, which means that it did have some redeeming qualities. like the dialogue...wow. there was more or less no plot, the characters were all stupid, and the movie was preachy. there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence, which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder. i cannot even believe that there are like 20 other people who have seen this movie. yeah, it is worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie, or at least can try to.","label":0},{"index":1530,"txt":"The dudes at MST3K should see this dog of a film.

It would have been a lot nicer if he were to be portrayed by a young lad. One good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from Whatever Happened To Robot Jones? The show is not bad really.

It is witless and often embarrassing. The plot, the basic making into show business routine, is almost nonexistent. In fact, the film is merely an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular music groups of 1942, including the Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby, and Freddy Slack. Each group gets about the standard three minutes, the exception being the Mills Brothers, who for some reason warranted two numbers. Ann Miller does not get to dance until the last couple of minutes of the film, and she has little to do but strut her stuff amid a barrage of patriotic propaganda.The most interesting moment in the film, in my view, occurred in the Duke Ellington segment. The band appears to be playing in a train, standing in awkward positions. In the deep South at the time, the band was segregated in railroad cars when traveling. Johnny Hodges is seen next to Duke, and Harry Carney may also be identified. In the last moments of the film, trumpeterviolinist Ray Nance rushes down the aisle to the camera and does an uncle Tom, bugging his eyes and wiggling his head the way Willy Best did in many films. For modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this homage to segregation is sad indeed. Some movies go best unseen.","label":0},{"index":1537,"txt":"From around the time Europe began fighting World War II, until the wars end, Hollywood with significant prodding from the government made tons of movies which were designed to try and get young men to enlist in the Army, by making the life of a serviceman appear cool. This is by far the sloppiest, implying that the life of a soldier is devoid of work, you get the best food, and you get to lie around all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio. I am far too young to have participated in WWII, but I think that there was more to it than that. There is the barest cats whisker of a plot, and a bunch of musical numbers featuring some of the days leading acts.I think that by 1943, even the most naive of civvies knew that there was more going on overseas than the wacky hijinks portrayed in this movie. While I am sure that it was meant to be viewed as escapist entertainment, I cannot help but wonder if the family and loved ones of men fighting in the war, were amused or repulsed by this trivialization of their loved ones sacrifice.","label":0},{"index":1538,"txt":"Before I start, let me say that my experience of this movie might have been influenced by the dubbing, which I gather from other comments was the original one which is considered inferior by some. So, it is entirely possible that subtitles or the apparently new DVD version would make a difference. I have also not read the corresponding book; I am only familiar with one other Japanese manga and might be lacking cultural context.Potential minor spoilers ahead.I usually like darkly tinged science fiction stories the likes of Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc., but I did not enjoy this movie at all. While it started out mildly intriguing, it became tedious by the time it was only halfway finished. There are all sorts of problems; let us start with what is probably the most severe the dialogue. The characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences; if they are not shouting each others names for the nth time, they are usually grunting monosyllables Kanedaaa!, Tetsuoooo!, Huh?, Grrr, etc.. This leaves most of the characters entirely underdeveloped and twodimensional. It does not help in the least that a lot of them get only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that would develop them away from the stereotypes suggested by the visuals.The grunting is augmented by some random pseudophilosophical technobabble that sounds vague and uninspired even by Star Trek standards. There is nothing deep and meaningful here  it all seems haphazard, thrown together at random from various bits and pieces of stock scifi ideas with no coherency whatsoever.What little there is of an intelligible plot is no more than an excuse to begin the overlong final sequence which consists of escalating scenes of mayhem and destruction. Not that there is anything wrong with a nice bit of mayhem and destruction, of course; but in this case you will find yourself asking what is the point of it all, and how long until it is over. Character development in the last 30 minutes or so consists of little more than Tetsuo turning into Pizza the Hutt for no readily apparent reason.The ending resembles the one in 2001  a bizarre string of images that, far from resolving or explaining anything, leave the viewer feeling he is just been looking into a kaleidoscope for two hours. I am sure some will claim that this sort of thing is art; but to me it was just a lot of admittedly imaginative use of colour and shapes. Some of the music was also quite interesting. Unfortunately it is all style and no substance.Tired of Disney? Want to watch animated movies dealing intelligently with adult themes?

While the acting was not terrible, but not great, for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, little romance. There were many loose ends that do not show up or are not addressed. Unfortunately, the main characters do come off as complete cowards. They do not know themselves well enough to realize that they do not love the people they are engaged to. How do we know they are not in love? By the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances. I can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show.The movie does not even end with a wedding scene, more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing. This movie is really about two people who cannot commit to anything, unlike Cusacks previous characters, who were more than willing to make a deep commitment Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc..The greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns, or anything of interest. When the movie ended, I felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story, which basically fits the whole movie boring.

On a technical note, the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times. Then again, this could be called a blessing. Overall, this same story could have better been told in a short film w a running time under 30 minutes. The obvious in your face homages to Sam Raimi and Evil Dead would have been good had they been more subtle, but here they seem more like a bald faced rip off. Cmon, this kind of 35mm budget and THIS is the best that could be done? Still, the cinematography, lighting design and shots were very well done indeed.","label":0},{"index":1558,"txt":"Exactly what you would expect from a BMovie. Deritive, gratuitous nudity, boring in parts, ridiculous gore and cheesy specialeffects.

The actors pretty much sucked, in fact this pretty much seemed like an episode of buffy the vampire slayer or something except with a lot of blood, profanity and nudity.Tiffany Shepis must be singled out. She absolutely is the scream queen of the new millennium. Not that acting really matters in these movies, but she was better than any of the other actors. She is also smokin hot, in that plastic jump suit thing she wore for the whole movie  wow! Her posterior is absolutely stunning in that outfit, I mean it every single time she turns around you can help but check her out.

TERRIBLE. also, just what we understand about the house.. it apparently needs to use its video cameras to see what is going on, and it is a very emotional house. not a spirit, or demon, or entity, it is a house thats possessed, but by what? we are led to believe an inanimate object learned to love suziemargaret, our protagonist? now that I am on the topic of suzie.. another scene that totally bothered me, this poor old crazy lady comes, tells you she was your nurse, pours her heart out, falls in the boiling pool, struggling in agony for 45 seconds, and what does margaret do? does she risk her hands being burnt to save this poor elderly woman that came there to warn hers life? no, she stands there and watches! the acting for the most part was better than average for a horror film, but that is where the positives end. for at least a more interesting, and fun horror film about an inanimate object that kills people watch death bed the bed that eats. i have a feeling the people who rated this so highly either have not watched it since it originally aired, or remembered it scaring them as children. this film was pretty much merit less.","label":0},{"index":1560,"txt":"It is kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece. I am not a dullard as far as quality films go, and I will agree that from a technical filming standpoint, as well as for several of the characters portrayed, the film is in an awardworthy class. But there is no sense for me of this film actually going anywhere; I mean, taking the viewer anywhere. It is a series of mood scenes, perhaps remarkable as such, but I want more from a film. I look for story and movement and a fulfillment of arrival, none of which did I find in this film. Yes, it might be considered poetry on film . . . but there is much poetry that I cannot live with for the same reason that it paints pictures without going anywhere.One thing further to be said is that it documents a midcentury English childhood, which is necessarily limited in its universality. I was personally appalled at what a young British boy had to live through, in that time and place. Having grown up in America just a decade earlier, I can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense. I cannot help wondering if this contrast has had some effect on those reviewing the film so favorably. In other words, could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its filmic magic which I acknowledge is there and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of ones actual recalled experience?","label":0},{"index":1561,"txt":"I had to watch this in school.

The story could have been taken out from a bravo photostory, the dialogues were as wooden as Treebeard and the plot holes were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy.

I just saw it in my first sneak preview ever and although I paid nonrefundable money for it, I walked out of the cinema after a mere 15 minutes. Which already includes 2 minutes of discussion among my friends whether or not to leave. First time EVER I walked out of a movie. And I lived through some pretty bad ones.It is one of those films that is dubbed and badly so even though it is shown in its original language. It relies on the oldest, simplest and cheapest jokes in the book. On the military What do we do once we reach the fighting zone?  You get out of the car and die; actually, it is much funnier to read here that the way it was delivered in the film, on drugs a guy eats some space cookies, behaves really silly and misses his wedding or has to live through it while high  all badly written and acted, on women in the army Why do we only get trumpets? We were promised guns!  That is the way it is, that is the way it will stay... Argh. Okay, you might actually find these genuinely funny, but in that case you seriously scare me.Additionally, I have seen better acting in the kind of soft porn films you get on European late night TV. So it had lame jokes delivered badly, beyond lower average acting, lacked pace, was badly dubbed and edited \u0096 It just did not work. At least not on any level used as a measure for films.I would even be so bold as to say that this flick proves that there are people who can be a lot less funny zan zee Germans. And that is saying something if you like stereotypes. Which I do not, it is nice to play with them, though. Just in case somebody thinks I am not being PC enough.Instead of going to see this film, do something useful.

The HEPO military police will not come to get you if you do not make your appearance, especially not on your wedding day. The actors were pretty embarrassed during this scene, because the scene did not work as it was so highly unlikely. You can sense it in their voices. Even if they were not such bad actors, they would not have been able to save the scene. Next the guy has to exercise in his wedding suit. No, there was no time to get him an uniform first.

I doubt in Hollywood they would let her say a single line in a B movie. Okay girls in the military! Now this is getting fun. The girls are even placed on the same floor, so we can sneak to their room at night! In reality they would be placed in a different building a quarter mile away, separated by two fences with barbed wire. There are tanks available we can use for a fun ride in our spare time, of which we have plenty. No, the tanks are not locked, and the ignition keys are inserted. No one will notice the engine sounds, especially not at night.There is a bunch of sex scenes and references and all are below the waste line. We need those so the sexually obsessed Germans will like the movie as well. Switzerland is too small a market for any feature film. Well done!One sex scene takes place in the kitchen. Surely, none of those facilities are ever locked. The military routines are as sloppy as they can get.In the end of the brainless flick, the mafia hit men are about the take revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him! Because he deserted his fianc\u00e9e! Sure I buy that, the Italians are that waya jealous bunch not. The bad guys attempt to do this in open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses. Not at night in a dark alley. Again, military training grounds where there is shooting with live ammo are open to the public, anyone can freely drive or walk in there. There are no such things as guards or fences. The deed however is prevented by the good captain timely launching a rocket into the Italians car. The explosion knocks the hit men and the enraged fianc\u00e9e off their feet. No one in 40 feet distance is hurt when the car is blown to smithereens. It is a COMEDY, remember.Okay. It is a comedy, I got that, and I can live with that. No realism needed. Filmmakers can easily get way with this if it is hilariously, side splitting funny, or entertaining, interesting, challenging. Unfortunately it is none of those. It is just embarrassing. A ripoff from brainless American comedies.

The plot is virtually non existent and the philosophies are kitchy at best, poorly delivered the rest of the time. The complete lack of anything resembling sympathetic characters does not help the situation. There really was no growth, no forward movement at all. Even the climactic suicide scene was effectually neutered by once again refusing to let death or anything resembling reality or adult life enter in. Each cookie cutter figure simply goes about making you hate them in the blandest, most predictable way possible. The Stalker is a creep for no discernible reason other than he is a Stalker and Andie MacDowell is gorgeous. The Jackass does everything in his power to constantly remind you he is, well, a jackass.

Since it was the same person Joel Schumacher it must be both. But then Schumacher has since given us The Phantom of the Opera, Phone Booth, A Time to Kill, and two Batman movies, Batman and Robin and Batman Forever which range from good to great directing. Something went wrong on StEF because it has no genius whatsoever, no comedy worth anything, and is very far off the mark on what is truly valuable in life. Example The character Wendy a rich little girl with a heart to do good and help the less fortunate played by Mare Winningham  reveals to Billy an unruly slob who cheats on his wife and on his girlfriends, drinks far too much and has no sense of order in his life appropriately played by Rob Lowe that she is still a virgin. Billy truly see a challenge and possible conquest but Wendy is not ready. Wendy, in fact is so not ready it is hard to believe she is in this clique of friends. Later in the story, when Billy whose wife has left him taken his child and married another has somehow drawn some of the strings of his life together. Billy is leaving for New York, deserting and abandoning all parental responsibility for his baby daughter, he convinces Wendy that her virginity would be the perfect going away gift from her to him. And Wendy, who works as a social worker helping broken families, seems not to be phased at all by this despot. Give me a break. The one thing she can only give once, she gives to a loser who is leaving his family and friends? Schumacher frames this scene as a wonderful and touching moment.Many more example exist where there is a complete disconnect between what is real and of value being tossed overboard and the acts are made to look like virtue.I suppose some may say that that was the 80s but I remember it was in the 80s that men began to be held responsible for the children they fathered whether in a marriage or out.I think this movie is so bad because it is so out of sync with what it really valuable and right.As for the technique not the story, it was terrible as well. It is disjointed and feels like a 3 hour movie that has been edited to 1 hour and 40 minutes. Transitions and jumps in time simply do not make sense. Pick up what is on the editing room floor, put it back in and the movie would probably flow much better...but it still is a horrible movie.Maybe Schumacher has become a better and stronger director since 1986 he must have or maybe he was over his head when it came to writing the screenplay for St Elmos Fire or maybe this group of actors took over the set and went their own way  that is what I really think happened.","label":0},{"index":1582,"txt":"I noticed Fire was on cable the other night and I began watching it because I could not recall anything specific about it other than I remember it being a horrible film when I saw it back in 85.

Hearing that song again made me want to jab a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted upon them. And to compound this musical assault Rob Lowes character played saxophone, and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was Charlie Parker, only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo. All the characters were intensely unappealing, although I must say they did a great job of casting equally unappealing actors to portray them.

It is full of clich\u00e9s and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing  much less funny.I hated it and I am not afraid to say so.

The character was played in affected and annoying way. Every time she appears it reminds that you re watching a movie and is destroying a spirit of the moment, then whole movie because the most time what you can see there are her stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create the emotion.

Only one person in a thousand understands the delight of being able to love more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bleh.Mark my words a few decades from now, polyphobia is going to be just as big a fauxpas as homophobia, but guess who was too closeminded to realize this? Right the first time the producers of this movie. And so many like it. Why even make a ridiculously conservative and oldfashioned type of movie like this?

Let us look at the problems in directionscript.Brother and sister both in their mid 30s seem to be well adjusted. They meet a complete stranger at a park and Heather Graham character walks up to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half sane person would be running the other way or at least scream for a police officer. He then awkwardly walks over and makes some stupid statements and she falls for him. Then after ONE date were they all go out together he falls in love with her and decides to get married in Vegas in a weeks time???? Hello does anyone feel stupid yet? He goes out with thousands of women and he meets this one person who says about 10 words that WE see on the screen and he wants to marry her. Not only was there no chemistry it just does not make sense. Sure it is a romantic comedy and I want to believe it could, but the direction made it completely flat.Now Heather falls head over heels with her too and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan very shallow character kiss or more to the point it was sloppiest kiss ever that chemistry MIGHT be there. I found it unromantic and unfunny and while many say Heather cannot act i think the reality is Heather was clearly the wrong person for this role.

Things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly WAY too much in common.Interesting, intriguing. However, instead of unraveling this story into something believable and palatable, the director keeps taking Gray into these ludicrous twists that never actually make any sense at all. Being an LGBT individual, this movie seemed to echo what all heterosexuals think we go through in the comingout process. I will be insulted if the writers queer.

You should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here, there are SPOILERS. Gray Matters centers on Gray and Sam Baldwin Heather Graham and Tom Cavanagh. Only Gray and Sam are Brother and Sister; living together in everyone elses eyes as man and wife. No sex but just about everything else. Early on, the movie starts with its theme the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions. Gray and Sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch. Rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him, she does it and gets to the nittygritty questions too. When she signals her brother to come over they start a 3way date. Charlie Bridget Moynahan is the girl of THEIR dreams, like all the right things etc\u0085 Sam final hits Gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal! That Charlie accepts! In one week Charlie, Gray and Sam are to be in Vegas. In the next week Charlie and Gray are off shopping for wedding gowns apparently Charlie has an offtherack figure. Gray is slurping an iced latte when Charlie suggests Gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a 10,000 frock for her. While Charlie is zipping her in this downpaymentonahouse gown Gray continues to slurp on the latte I swear it was like a feed bag. What should happen but woops! latte all over the gown. It is never explained how they got out of Bloomingdales bridal salon with out a 10,000 mocha colored gown. Back to reality \u0096 Caesars palace Las Vegas. They have the high roller room Sam is a resident surgeon and Charlie is an intern zoologist \u0096 were do they get all this money? Gray kicks Sam out to the single room down the hall so she and Charlie can have a bachelorette drinkathon were, you guessed it  they kiss. Gray remembers everything; Charlie remembers nada. They make it to wedding chapel and right when the Reverend gets to his line If there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds Gray gets the hiccups. Gray excuses herself, for some reason the Reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again hiccups. Gray gets back to NY and starts dating any man she meets, literally. And of course one is you guessed it again! Gay. The other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver Alan Cummings named Gordy. He is smittened with Gray but the feelings are not returned. They become great friends. This is good because when she comes clean with Sam about the kiss. He blows up and kicks her out of their apartment. When Sam comes to his senses he goes to her office. Gray works at an ad agency. This office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone. It has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency. Sam gets Gray in one of the conference rooms for a notsoprivate conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office. This is where I doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew Gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar. Sorry no men says the bouncer. So Gray and Gordy return with Gordy in drag. Bad drag. He was in a sleeveless black satinlike blouse, a string of pearls, and a grandmas church hat. No lesbian would ever confuse this man in a dress as a drag queen much less a woman. The bar was also the straight mans fantasy of what a lesbian bar is full of Victorias Secret models. Everything turns out peachy \u0096 she goes home with her firms client. Gray happens to be on the womans account and finally does more then kiss. For some reason no one tells Charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with Gray, but that is for the sequel.","label":0},{"index":1594,"txt":"I wish I would known more about this movie when I rented it. I would put it in my queue on the basis of Heather Graham and her strong cred as an actress IMHO. While parts of the movie were charming, much of the movie felt contrived, undeveloped, or otherwise just boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple... I do not care how big a part of the story line that is, it still felt a bit, um, gross. And Charlie, for a zoologist, she certainly does not seem to be very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens. What was it about her besides her hotness and some common interests that made Gray fall for her? The story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth. High points  Molly Shannon although I do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion, the cabbie in drag, and the dance sequences if Sam  Gray were such great dancers, I wish we would seen more of that, as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie. Could have been better.","label":0},{"index":1595,"txt":"I had to walk out on this film fifteen minutes from the end... having passed through the cringe stage and into pure boredom. What really horrifies me, I mean truly disturbs me, is that there are people referring to this aimless drivel as delightful or a must see. I would feel deep pity for those so afflicted were it not for the distinct impression that most of the positive comments about this shallow and humourless travesty were written by industry plants.The truth is this is a lame film that does nothing to entertain nor enlighten. It is decidedly unfunny, poorly scripted and has all the pace and energy of cold, canned rice pudding. To be kind to Ms Kramer, the best one can say is it was a missed opportunity, for having read the synopsis before I watched it, I had expected something more challenging. The possible misinterpretations of a close brother and sister codependence, the unexpected awakening of sisterly sexuality, and the comic potential in such sibling rivalry for the affections of the same girl were all obvious subjects for refreshing comedic exploration, yet which at every turn the movie frustratingly shies away from.Instead, the audience is subjected to a meandering series of uninspired and insipidly drawn situations, with clich\u00e9d characterisations and dull performances from a cast struggling for belief and obviously in need of much tighter direction. The lack of directorial control seems astounding; on the one hand, Moynahan, Cavanagh and Spacek all give very pedestrian performances, while Heather Graham and Molly Shannon  the latter in particular  veer towards embarrassing overcompensation at times. One could lay the blame for this on the director  maybe Sue Kramer hopes that if her actors overact, they will force a bigger laugh from the audience. But then again, the cast is a veteran one; one would expect them to do better.Sue Kramer really needs to think carefully what kind of movies she wants to make, and for whom. Given the possible issues Gray Matters alludes to, and given her inability or unwillingness to fully explore them in the context of a comedy, perhaps she should consider writing dramas instead. I know it is never easy to make films about women and womens issues, especially when one hopes to reach a wider audience than women alone, but whatever direction she takes, inconsequential and flimsy characters like Gray are not going to cut mustard.","label":0},{"index":1596,"txt":"Sam Thomas Cavanagh and Gray Heather Graham are devoted siblings who share an apartment and a love of many things  ballroom dancing, 1940s movie musicals and, much to their surprise, an attractive woman named Charlie Bridget Moynahan. Historically heterosexual, Gray is confused by her new feelings.Gray Matters proves to be one of the blandest films I have ever seen. It is dull, predictable, unfunny, poorly acted and poorly written. Nothing about it felt real and everything was very cheesy. Also, this is not really a romantic comedy with a special twist but more of a coming out movie. Sue Kramer tried to make the first half cute with the romantic stuff and the second half serious with the actual acceptance and coming out part. Unfortunately, she failed miserably. The first half was largely unfunny and only Heather Graham was able to hold it up a little. Then, the film took an awkward tone and got all serious. The serious scenes were handled poorly and all of the emotions just felt phony.I guess I would have enjoyed the film a little more if the relationships between the characters felt more authentic. The brother and sister relationship was very weak and they did not really appear to be that close. Their relationship just did not feel very natural. Also, the relationship between Tom and Bridget felt very unnatural. If two people are going to get married after only knowing each other for less than a week, then you would expect to see a little more excitement but the characters talked about getting married in Vegas in the same manner of asking a waiter what the specials are. There was a lack of excitement in the film and it was hard to get involved with the movie with such unmotivated characters.The acting was mostly weak which was a bit surprising given the decent cast. Heather Graham gave the only good performance in the movie. She was funny and had a few charming scenes but it is too bad that all of her costars were complete duds. Bridget Moynahan was very weak and her performance ringed false on every level. Also, it seemed like she was reading her lines. Thomas Cavanagh was pretty wooden and he showed nearly no emotion. The chemistry between Thomas and Heather was non existent and that damaged the film because their relationship felt phony. I can usually rely on Molly Shannon to be funny in a supporting role but here she was just annoying. Sissy Spacek had about two scenes and she was annoying in both of them. Finally, Alan Cumming just had an embarrassing character and his performance was not very good. Overall, Gray Matters is a lame film and it is not worth watching.

The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is apparently only a surprise to her. There is a deeply offensive wedding sequence, a deeply embarrassing drunk act from Moynahan and Graham, and a performance that would embarrass forests everywhere for its woodenness from Tom Cavanagh. Sissy Spacek demonstrates a complete inability to do comedy and will want this excised from her resume. Molly Shannon plays the homely friend with lumpen insouciance. Only Alan Cumming emerges with any credit but is seriously underemployed and given nothing with which to work. The whole disaster is cemented by Grahams bizarre eyerolling performance culminating with the penultimate scene where she wears a comedy hat and an overcoat despite the scene being set in a lesbian bar.

With a brief runtime of 88 minutes, this film was long past drawnout and buried itself beneath a bundle of repetitive jokes \u0096 jokes that came at a minority and were not even funny in the first place. Hot Rods base material is as superficial and irrelevant as 2004s cult hit Napoleon Dynamite, though it is much more contrived and comes without ANY of the laughter. In fact, the movies blatant desperation to be compared to Napoleon Dynamite is scornful and offensive, and left me ticked off, instead of just being annoyed.The movie, if one were compelled enough to call it such, poses a paltry story that puts selfproclaimed stuntman Rod Kimble before us, with the trifling intention of jumping fifteen buses one more than his idol Evel Knievel jumped, so we are told by Rod and raising 50,000 dollars for his stepfathers impending lifesaving heart operation; all so that he can fight his stepfather, once recovered, and gain his respect\u0085 because in order to gain ones respect, one must first fight them. Huh? Whatever. Each character is no more interesting than Rods stickon mustache, and from the films opening joke to its ridiculous conclusion, each scene played like a nonsensical, and terribly unfunny, SNL skit \u0096 which, with the addition of an extra 85 minutes, is, essentially, what Hot Rod strives to be.The films star, Andy Samberg, contributed an effort to the screen that observably exerted every last dripdrop of his comedic capabilities.

To rescue them of their mortification, I will willingly omit the ghastliness of Sambergs costars roles and leave the second third of The Lonely Island team, director Akiva Schaffer, to his nonexistent talent as a director\u0085 or a comedian. Basically, every thing one could possibly do to further trample a crashcourse comedy is perfectly portrayed here; and done so arrogantly, as though the film would be funnier that way.

Ninjas to thwart KGB and rescue Markov and his daughter.Comments A cult movie that despite not being very good needs seeing. The movie is quite ambitious but lacking in many areas. First off is that it is very dark, probably to conceal locations and bad effects, that some scenes are hard to comprehend. You cannot see what is happening. The second thing that it is lacking is martial arts, despite being a ninjamovie. Sure there are some, of quite poor quality, but mostly the ninjas fires automatic guns or sets of explosions. The automatic guns pose a problem too as they seem to have a endless supply of ammunition. And the ninjas seem almost immune to bullets while Soviet guards die like flies.What does it have that speaks for it then? The idea and ambition foremost. Some actually, and especially for a Swedish movie, decent actionscenes albeit not of martial arts. Some nice slowmotion scenes and pretty much blood and gore. And some very interesting new weapons technology that makes the victims heart or brain explode.

Like the human torch at a childrens birthday party. There were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts. Just when all hope and money is lost, along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses Rod wants to jump. He gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations. Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle. The whole town turns out and the world tunes in. Does he make the jump? Does he get the girl? Do they raise the 50k? Does Frank get his ass beat by Rod?

Humans do not often make it onto that menu, granted, but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be exhibiting abnormal behavior. It is not like it is never happened. The odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town, singling out a human nemesis, sinking several dozen thick hulled North Atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people, all friends of the aforementioned nemesis, are close enough to the water for it to reach, are so slim as to be laughable.

A fisherman Nolan is out to nab a killer whale, a very bad thing, but when he accidentally ACCIDENTALLY mark you hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate, the cow  and I use the word in all senses  who is obviously a sick psychobitch and the canonical villain of the piece  throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself. I doubt it was her first. When her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous selfinflicted wounds, her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt, kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to Nolan. Obviously as among humans, total psychos date other total psychos.The film reeks of halfthought out antihuman message, the poor poor whale!! the evil men must suffer and die! and yet, it does not succeed in demonizing Nolan at all. It is true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel, but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and, as the film progresses, he grows more and more compassionate to the whales pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale, just to make it feel a little better.The films final journey, in which Nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north, reminds me of Melvilles eerie manwhale connection, and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion, where these two husbands might connect, understand even respect each other in their own grief, for Nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident. It is clear Nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss. However, it never goes there. The whalecharacter has no compassion or respect for anyone.The final scene loses this focus and becomes Jawslike where the seamonster finally kills everybody and Nolan and nodoubt through an oversight, fails to chomp up the whalehugger tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier. I love animals, and I detest whaling, and what is more I love orca whales, but if this films goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed. Nolan shows compassion and growth, and feels for others, and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming.The only message one can walk away with is If you see an orca whale, ever, anywhere, run the other way cause if you step on his FIN the wrong way, he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you.","label":0},{"index":1629,"txt":"Many have stated that Orca \u0096 Killer Whale is a Jaws ripoff. This is not really true, though the enormous commercial success of Jaws undoubtedly made these man .vs. beast stories more attractive propositions for filmmakers in the second half of the 70s. Orca \u0096 Killer Whale would be better described as a modernday retread of Moby Dick. It is a story about obsession. On one hand a whales obsessive quest to avenge the death of its mate; on the other a bounty hunters obsessive quest to kill the whale before it can claim any more lives. Sadly, Orca Killer Whale emerges a very disappointing film, its fundamentally interesting ideas somewhat ruined by hammy performances and preposterous plotting.Shark hunter Nolan Richard Harris encounters a marinelife researcher Rachel Bedford Charlotte Rampling diving off the Atlantic coast of Canada. Their meeting almost ends in disaster when Rachels team are attacked by a Great White Shark, but a Killer Whale arrives in the nick of time to stop the shark. After this, Nolan becomes increasingly obsessed with capturing a Killer Whale and selling it to an aquarium. But his plans backfire when he accidentally kills a pregnant female of the species while the distraught male looks on. Rachel tells Nolan that a Killer Whale is an incredibly intelligent mammal with a strong memory and feelings just like a human. Worse still, native Umilak Will Sampson warns him that the whale will always remember its grief and do everything it can to have revenge. Nolan initially tries to forget about the whole regrettable incident, but the whale causes havoc in the fishing town and the disgruntled locals begin to demand that Nolan puts to sea to track it down and destroy it. Eventually Nolan is forced to pursue the Killer Whale\u0085 the hunt leads all the way to the desolate ice floes of the Arctic Ocean, where man and beast play out their final fatal battle against each other.Two things stand out in this film. One is the haunting score by Ennio Morricone perhaps the greatest composer of film music of alltime, his talents wasted on various tenthrate clunkers during the 70s and 80s. The other is the amazing widescreen photography of Ted Moore, which makes the film consistently pleasing to the eye. In every other department, Orca \u0096 Killer Whale is a shoddy film that does nothing to enhance the reputation of its talented cast and crew. Harris appears extremely ill throughout the film, his hair bedraggled, black rings around his eyes and skin deathly pale. His performance lacks the usual vitality. Rampling strikes a lot of sexy poses but fails to convince with her longwinded and illinformed explanations about the ways of whales. The rest of the actors are wasted in brief and undeveloped roles, the most memorable of which sees Bo Derek getting her leg bitten off by the vengeful whale. The plot is total nonsense from start to finish, with such preposterous sequences as the whale deliberately starting a fire in the fishing village that engulfs and destroys the local refinery! Although it is credible to suppose that whales are intelligent creatures with genuine emotions, the idea that a whale could plot revenge against a single human adversary and carry it out so calculatedly is utterly absurd. Orca \u0096 Killer Whale is really one for completists of the man .vs. beast cycle from the late 70s. Most will come away from the film shaking their heads in disbelief and grinding their teeth with despair.","label":0},{"index":1630,"txt":"I do not know who got the idea that orcas go around killing people and bashing and destroying things for revenge but my god is it absurd.

The script by producer Luciano Vincenzoni  Sergio Donati is so stupid I am lost for words, the fact that it seems to take itself very seriously does not help  if I have to listen to Charlotte Rampling go on about how intelligent Killer Whales are just one more time I will scream. I am sorry but I simply do not believe a Killer Whale is intelligent enough to know who any particular boat belongs to  sink it, I do not believe a Killer Whale can cause a huge explosion including knocking an oil lantern from a wall on the opposite side it hits as there is no way on earth it could know it was there, I do not believe a Killer Whale can identify someones house, know someone is in there  then wreck it on purpose, I do not believe a Killer Whale can move icebergs around in order to trap a boat, I do not believe Killer Whales can physically recognise people  I do not believe it has any revenge instincts or at least none that are as strong as this dumb film makes out. Maybe I am being a bit harsh, I mean it is only a film after all but it is a film which is trying to be serious  things just got so ridiculous that I was half expecting the Killer Whale to write a letter to Nolan to tell him his plan  hand or should that be fin? deliver it, the thing seemed intelligent enough to do just about anything else. They should have asked it to come up with a cure for the common cold! Seriously, that is a statement that is no more far fetched than anything else in this film. I found the film very boring, totally dull  had awful characters with no on screen presence at all. It goes without saying this is a Jaws 1975 ripoff which does not even come close to Spielbergs classic.Director Anderson is no Spielberg that is for sure, this rubbishy film has absolutely no suspense, scares, tension or atmosphere at all. All the attack scenes are as dull as dishwater  totally forgettable, there is no build up to them  virtually no pay off either as Orca does not get to eat a single person. Then there is the scenes which literally had me laughing, the shots of the Killer Whale appearing to cry are pure comedy  the opening scenes of the two Killer Whales I suspect tried to show them as a loving  caring couple but I could not help but think that this is the closest we will ever get to Killer Whale porn, hilarious stuff. The footage of the Killer Whales themselves is bland  boring, instead of footage which matches  enhances the scenes around it it just looks like dreary wildlife documentary footage that has little connection to anything else. Do you get the impression that I do not like this film? Good. Forget about any gore or decent deaths either, there is a brief scene when Bo Derek has her legs bitten off but blink and you will miss it.This probably had quite a big budget  it still sucks, there is nothing outstanding about Orca, it is well made I suppose but flat, bland  totally forgettable.

I could not stand to watch this movie again. The direction of this film is poor and when compared to Jaws it looks like the director, producers, and writers were almost talentless.As for the acting, it was very average and believable, however the actual characters are not the least bit likable.

He becomes so inspired by the Christmas card that he feels it has given him a ray of hope and happiness in his life, a motivation to continue on. When he is given leave, he goes to the very town that the woman lives in. He comes across and spunky young woman and eventually finds out that she is the one that sent the Christmas card. He meets the family and after saving her dad a Vietnam War Veteran from getting hit by a car whilst crossing the street, the family decides to take him in for a while. We learn that he does not have a family back home. The soldier agrees to help out the family during the Christmas season by working with them at their logging company. The family comes to love him and viceversa. The soldier also becomes in love with the familys daughter  the woman that sent the Christmas card. There is only one problem. She already has a serious relationship with a man that she is in love with. It is also a long distance relationship. The boyfriend is very different from the soldier. He prefers wine and trips to France over hard labor and the great outdoors. The woman prefers the latter. Throughout the rest of the film, there is a love triangle as the womans boyfriend is back in town visiting her for the season. Everyone in the family seems to want the daughter to be with the soldier and the mom basically wants what is best for her daughter. SPOILER ALERT The woman comes to like the soldier more and more, as they have a lot in common. They happen to spend a lot of time together. She gradually becomes attracted to his persona. Then one day he kisses her and and she kisses him back. Now she is so confused! She is in love with her boyfriend and wants to marry him someday, but she is become so fond of the soldier. Soon enough, the boyfriend who does not know about the kiss, but is very protective of the woman and thinks the soldier has been trying to move in on her decides to propose to the woman and she accepts. His plans for their marriage, however, are not plans that she wants. She wants to be at home, have kids and be close to her family. He wants to travel the world, go to exotic places and if they have kids he wants to take them along. This does not sound too thrilling for the woman. However, the soldier feels bad about what he is done and does not want to make things worse. So, he decides to leave town, despite the dads urging him to stay and be with his daughter. It all comes to a head when, at the Christmas Eve service with Church, we find out that the soldier has not left yet. The boyfriend and the woman speak to each other outside and he, brokenhearted, basically decides to let her go and breaks up with her. The film ends with the woman and the soldier getting together.Things I like I like the soldier throughout much of the film. He is basically nice and polite, with a strong sense of doing good for others; there are moments in which the family is going with Church and participating in charitable causes; the family hold hands and pray during an evening meal at the table; the dad and mom have a longlasting and evidently healthy marriage; the soldier tries to do the right thing in a situation after he did something very wrong Things I do not like There is a very typical love triangle story in this film; the soldier turns sour as he slowly and subtly moves in on the woman and then eventually kisses her when she already has a boyfriend; most of the family practically applauds this behavior  the family goes with Church and participates in services, yet this is how they act; there is some bad language Conclusion I became disappointed as the film ran on, and it got worse and worse. I ended up fast forwarding the very end of the film because I had enough. So, the film started out decent with some few gem moments, but ended up ruining itself. Therefore, I do not recommend this film to anyone.","label":0},{"index":1640,"txt":"Sorry my fellow Nevada City neighbors, but this one is bad.Brian must have had too much botox because he had very little facial expressions through out the entire movie.Alice looked like she had a board strapped to her backside.

I like a good romance as well as anyone, but as my wife and I were watching thisand before we saw the ratingwe said, There are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there is nothing in it to challenge their brains, their faith, their comfort level or their cultural preferences. It is possible to make a good film like that and Away from Her is an example, but this was amateur hour. There are some quite good films rated much lower than this one.

Consider one reviewer extolling the films virtues that include no sex, violence or gore. Uh, excuse me. The very setup of the film has us watching as Codys young comrade, with love of life and who has everything to live for is blown to bits leaving Cody holding his lifeless, bloody body. And, given the nature of war we know that Cody has seen horror on almost a daily basis. So much for those viewing this film with such rose glasses that the violence which defines Codys persona is erased from viewer memory.Sans any family of his own Cody, like John Rambo, roams the country on his bike making the long trek to hometown USA in the guise of some place called Nevada City. No mention, no realization of the clear fact that Cody is damaged goods. We know this since his CO practically declares him so as he order Cody to get some rest away from the death and destruction of war. This explains, as none seem to notice or care, Codys obvious flat effect. It is not bad acting. It is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder. Not guessing here, remember his CO ordered him off the battle field.How about that accidental kiss as noted by another review. The fall was an accident, the kiss was not. How exactly was Cody respecting Faith by hitting on her knowing full well she was spoken for? Now that was a nonfamily value moment. A moment which is then announced to the immediate universe as if posted on YouTube. Of course faiths lapse of fidelity as well as Codys coming on to a woman who plans to marry another is received in the spirit of the Xmas season, all CHEERING their cheaten hearts and lips.We know little about Faiths fianc\u00e9 except that she professes her love for him, she takes no longer than a nano second to accept his proposal could have waited if any second thoughts, he is generous, he loves her to death, the family has nothing really against him, he believes marriage is based on compromises and the two have never discussed post marriage plans. No evil doers here.Asner is a fine actor given over the hill dialogue like we love you son.... You are part of our family literally days after they have met a stranger named Cody. And the band of brothers speech where the phrase was above all never intended to apply to virtual strangers off the battle field.Bottom line This film is cotton candy Xmas fluff that betrays itself in major ways. Most grossly when it applauds Codys disrespect for Faith by physically hitting on her knowing full well she is spoken for. By redefining family as we know it to wit accepting a virtual stranger as a full fledged loving member of the family because we all love you.

First off, some of the acting is great, in particular Nick Stahl as The Bully, and the girl with the curly brown hair I cannot recall her name, but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is a veteran of Clarks films now and he was so brilliant in Kids, but in Bully he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually. The screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student. No sorry, a high school student...one who has never seen a movie before. And I could not fathom Clarks intentions. Was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids existence? It sure as hell did not stop him getting in a damn good perv.

Like most video game turned movies, I would say the majority do not translate into a different medium really well. And that goes for this one too, painfully.There is a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story, and the mysterious island on which a writer Leo Morimoto and his children, daughter Yuki Yui Ichikawa and son Hideo Jun Nishiyama come to move into. The villagers do not look all too friendly, and soon enough, sound advice is given about the siren on the island, to stay indoors once the siren starts wailing.Naturally and slowly, things start to go bump, and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants. But in truth, you will not bother with what is going on, as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more. What was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly illplacedoutofthenorm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity, until it is explained much later. It is one thing trying to come up and present something smart, but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes covered.Despite it clocking in under 90 minutes  I think it is a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark  it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to. Things begin to pick up toward the last 20 minutes, but it is a classic case of too little too late.What saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end. Again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience. It turned out rather satisfactorily, but leaves a bad aftertaste as you will feel cheated somewhat. There are two ways a twist will make you feel  it either elevates the movie to a memorable level, or provides you with that hokey feeling. Unfortunately Forbidden Siren belonged more to the latter.The saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light, shadows and mirrors, but I will be that explicit  it is still not worth the time, so better to avoid this.","label":0},{"index":1650,"txt":"Because some people, like me, like to know EVERYTHING about a movie even if they plan to see it, including the ending.

Maybe I have got that wrong; and Shelley Winters is there laughing, and the Judge has a cape on, and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him, and he throws back the cloak, and he has goat legs, and he announces he is actually her father, the Devil, and she is played right into their the satanic cults hands, because the mortal guy she has fallen in love with I guess that is Robert Foxworth turns out also to be the guy Satan wants to marry her off to, The Demon with Yellow Eyes, and yep, sure enough, they show Robert Foxworth, and his eyes glow yellow.

It does not come off. It is merely another thirdrate tedious 30s comedy, heightened only by the personalities of Stan and Ollie who never really display any of their trademarked gestures Ollies finger wiggling, Stans blank stares, etc. or comic abilities.The film begins with them running from the police. Since we never see or know why, it is hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught, and thus hiding in Colonel Buckshots mansion. The premise for the humor, Ollie passing himself off as the Colonel and Stan passing himself off as both the butler and the maid are never very engaging. They are not playing Stan and Ollie in this film. Their parts could have been played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be just as poor.Stan could mime and make whatever he would do funny, but he does not get the chance to do any of that here. He is constrained by uttering too much dialog to move the plot, but none of it rises much above the silly. We are treated to endless third rate comedy chestnuts such as the running gag of not correctly pronouncing Lord Plumtrees name, the Call me a cab! Okay you are a cab! joke, cops losing their clothes and being seen in long johns, and a nonsequiter ending of Stan and Ollie as the two parts in a painfully obvious horse costume as they make their escape on a bicycle for two, and James Finlayson is still doing his silentera full body takes and Keystone Kop jumping jacks.Stan and Ollie do much better in a situation comedy in Sons of the Desert1933 where we get to see them do what we love about them  be themselves.

They were extremely popular and their boss Hal Roach took full advantage by keeping them working constantly. In addition, this was a time of experimentation for the writers and Stan. I would say this was an experiment that really did not work. As someone else said, it does not play to their strengths. Too much dialog and plot.The best part of this one for me is the largely improvised sequence with Stan as Agnes the maid and the great Thelma Todd talking about girl stuff.If you really want to see the boys at their most creative and funny check out Blotto, or Brats From the same year.They made so many shorts in such a short time that I think they can be forgiven for turning out a few less then par shorts. They made something like 108 films altogether. Very few except for the ones made at FOX were outright failures but there are some. County Hospital, Me And My Pal, The Live Ghost, The Fixer Uppers come to mind as essentially weak ones. But other then those I find something wonderful in just about all their shorts.

Hollywoods sword and sandal epics mostly have a Christian theme, which makes it difficult to get into earlier Roman history Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule, and encountered some resistance in Hollywood because it did not have Jesus in it.It is interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of Caesar and Christ, but is set when Rome was only one city among many on the Italian peninsula, and had just ousted the hated King Tarquin and formed the Republic.However, this is not a historical film; it is peplum, and while the production values are not rock bottom, the acting and characterizations are cardboard.

If you ever do have the opportunity to view this series I recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the Godfather or perhaps Beaches in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a lowbudget reminder of what Laura Harris can simply state about her time on the show and I bet she would quote many a young actors words of defense by saying It is a start!","label":0},{"index":1656,"txt":"This is a fascinating filmespecially to old movie buffs and historians I am both. During the first half of the twentieth century, sadly, Black Americans were usually not allowed into White theaters. As a result, theaters catering to Black audiences wanted to show films reflecting the Black experience and showing Black actors. In many cases, the films were essentially similar plotwise to standard Hollywood fare, but with a much, much lower budgetand usually horrid production values. You really cannot fault the film makersthey just did not have the money and resources available to the average film company. As a result, they had to make due with a lot lessincluding an overreliance on stock actors that were seen again and again, no money for reshooting scenes and a need to get the films done FAST! This film tried very hard to be a Black version of a Gene Autry filmstarring Herb Jeffries instead. Jeffries was a lightskinned man from mixed ancestry and he starred in several similar cowboy films. In each, he sings a little, fights a little though VERY poorly and loves a littleeverything you need in a cowboy. Believe it or not, Jeffries is STILL alive at age 96.The general plot was indiscernible from an Autry picturecomplete with anachronistic items such as telephones out West! The problem is that despite its similarities, the low budget shines through. Stymie from the Lil Rascals flubbed a few lines but they just left it in, the fight scenes were totally unchoreographed and were among the worst ever put on film, there were some odd plot holes, there was no background music leaving the film strangely quiet and the acting was pretty awful.Now this does NOT mean that the film is not worth seeingonly that it abouts with technical problems that prevent it from being scored higher. One reviewer, oddly, scored this film a 10! How this can be with all the problems is beyond me. However, I can understand a person liking the film despite its many problems. The plot is generally pretty good, the characters likable, the musical numbers excellent and you know that the people making the film tried so darn hard AND it is a very important piece of American history.

From a book by Don Whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by Richard L. Green and John Twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by Mervyn LeRoy. However it did have splendid colour Cinematography by Joseph Biroc and a helpful score by the studios musical magician Max Steiner!The movie charts the history of the Bureau from its lowly beginnings in the twenties to modern times and its all seen through the recollections of aging fastidious agent Chip Hardesty James Stewart as he relates his investigative experiences  in flashback  to a class of budding young agents. But it is all very longwinded and episodic! And as it progresses it begins to look like a TV mini series instead of a major movie production as the young Hardesty runs the American crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as Baby Face Nelson, Ma Barker, Dillinger etc. to sorting out nefarious organisations like the Ku Klux Klan, Nazi spy rings and the Red Menace. And here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star THE FBI STORY would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster. Moreover, this is another problem with the picture  Stewart is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own! With the exception of Vera Miles  who has the thankless role of being his long suffering but devoted wife  he is surrounded by a cast of minor players! Throughout you find yourself half expecting someone like Robert Ryan, Jack Palance or even Raymond Burr to make a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police chief or whatever. But nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs! Pity!The film does however manage to give a good look inside the workings of the Bureau! With the help of Stewarts narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the organisation which includes the hundreds of agents in the field. And we are also treated to a peek inside headquarters which houses the gigantic records section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their daily chores.Another plus for the movie is Max Steiners remarkable score! Heard over the titles is a powerful, rousing and determined march while for the pictures gentler moments there is an attractive love theme. But quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the Ku Klux Klan sequence. And better still is the rhythmic LatinAmerican music the composer wrote for the South American scenes especially the exciting Fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the Federal troops on horseback. THE FBI STORY was one of five scores the composer wrote in 1959 which included Samuel Bronstons naval epic John Paul Jones, the charming Romcom Cash McCall, Delmer Daves seminal western The Hanging Tree and Daves A Summer Place from which derived the Young Love Theme  which was to become a major hit tune for Steiner better known as Theme From A Summer Place.THE FBI STORY just about passes muster as a movie thanks to Birocs rich colour Cinematography, Steiners wonderful music and of course Jimmie Stewart who makes anything watchable!Classic but implausible line from THE FBI STORY.............

And when something gets the ironic treatment, they are spot on. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa, he falls into the second catagory. This director has obviously tried too hard to make a Spanish Ken Loach type movie, without being able to capture the comedy, and warmth between the characters, that elevate Loach movies from merely being depressing. Los Lunes al Sol, is just that, only depressing. Things are unrealistically grim. The characters ultimate moments of misery all reach a climax at the same point, and if the glum story is not enough, Aranoa washes the tale over with a visually grey and grimy colour palette. The films was ridiculously overrated at the Goyas. A movie that shows empathy for the weaker citizens in society, in this case unemployed harbour workers, does not automatically make for a good movie, even though I would be the first to sympathize with the fates of these people. This movie only manages to make me grow disinterested in their fate. In 21st century Spain, unemployed people do not live like beggars, and the public transport ferries have decent restrooms, and it is hard to come across a bar with so few punters and such little happiness to be encountered in it. Leon de Aranoa obviously does not have a clue about working class Spain, and does it no favours. Pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene where the men watch a football match for free, has been directly copied from a film which deals much more realistically with the subject of the poverty trap, namely Purely Belter, which is afar more engaging, humorous, and yet sad.","label":0},{"index":1671,"txt":"AKA Mondays In The SunI have no idea what I just watched.

For example, while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80s, at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law, forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business. But instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence, the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame. Inexplicably, alcohol prohibition, the violence that ensued, and the subsequent reversal of prohibition, is totally ignored by this program.This program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users, and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war. The possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on. Use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems, but not all users do their drugs in excess, just like not all alcohol users are alcoholics.If you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government, for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science, has decided to totally prohibit, whose users it has decided to notsometaphorically wage war against, just forget about it. None of that is in here.On the other hand, this is hardly in the category of antidrug propaganda. It is mostly an interesting neutrallypresented history of drugs in 20th century United States like marijuana, LSD, heroin, cocaine, MDMA, and Oxycontin. But there is a significant element of various peoples points of view with regard to drug laws, and most but not all of that is not very thoughtful or wellinformed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality, especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana. The criminal justice system, along with its often harsh liferuining penalties, is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem, but unfortunately there is an epidemic in this nation of an asyet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs, a lack of compassion for fellow humans, a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentallyapproved, perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prisonpolicing industry, and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity. It is morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so, and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason. This is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs, yet this program ignores it.So, in sum, the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining. But when it comes to presenting a rational nonradical point of view with regard to drug policy, and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives, it is pretty disappointing.","label":0},{"index":1678,"txt":"It is not my fault.

This is a semiautobiographical look at what might happen to Madonna if she were ever to be stranded on a deserted island. There is absolutely no challenge to Madonna in this role, and it shows. She is just Madonna playing Madonna, and she cannot even get THAT right. I know what you are saying, you are saying, How do you know this is what Madonna is really like, you have never met her! Correct, I have not, but we all remember Truth or Dare, do not we? I know Kevin Costner does. You would think, in the year 2002, that Madonna might have learned something, one way or the other, from the crossover ladies that have also made their way across the silver screen. For goodness sake, has not Madonna seen Glitter? Mariah Carey showed the film world HOW IT IS DONE!!! Mariah kicks Madonnas trashy butt to the curb in beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, characterization, you name it! All we see from this glimpse into Madonnas world is she is the only one in it.  If there is one thing to be said for Madonna, it is that she is consistent. When she was an MTV darling, she set the world of womens fashion back 20 years. Now, in film, she has set womens roles in film AND society back 20 years, by glamourizing all the most hated, horrible, reprehensible, odious qualities women have been reputed to have locked away inside them, qualities they have been so desperately trying to prove they really do not possess. HERES THE SPOILERS!!! Do not READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU Do not WANT TO KNOW... Heres the one good thing I will say about this film, and I really was impressed by it. They did not go for the Hollywood Ending  Madonnas character lives. In the typical, happy Hollywood ending, Madonnas character would have died on the island, and her longsuffering, oppressed, whipped husband would have been free to finally settle down with a good, decent woman, a woman who would be the exact opposite of his deceased wife, and they both live happily ever after. But in this extremely depressing conclusion, she is rescued, and once more, this poor victim of a husband is once again saddled with his demon of a wife, and his life will once again become a living hell.  HERE ENDETH THE SPOILERS ","label":0},{"index":1681,"txt":"May contain spoilersI bent over backwards to be fair to this film. I knew it starred Madonna. I knew it lasted a whole week in theaters. I knew it got a lot of bad reviews. I was not expecting a deep and thoughtful examination of class, culture and sexuality like we got in the Italian original. The benefit of the doubt lasted a whole ten minutes.Madonna plays a rich, pretentious, nitwitted Gorgon who goes on vacation with her henpecked husband and flippant friends the brunette woman is as bad as Madonna, exhibiting some really dumb facial expressions. Adriano Giannini plays the ships firstmate who the Madonna character delights in humiliating and treating like dirt in every scene they have together. Why is she such a bitch to him? Simply because the plot requires it so that later when the two of them get marooned on a deserted Mediterranean island the tables will be turned and he will teach her a lesson. Just as inexplicable is how they fall in love despite having nothing in common and having abused each other for twothirds of the movie.Swept Away is a silly, simplistic, superficial movie from beginning to end. Madonna gives a typically wooden performance. There are many dumb scenes Madonna singing and dancing atrociously at the demand of Giannini, a fantasy scene with Madonna and a lot of scenes where he slaps her and kicks her in the butt. Guy Ritchie does his stylish editing which is laughable here. The film contains some of the worst dialog I have heard in a major movie in several years. The ending is sappy and implausible. It is basically The Blue Lagoon meets Overboard minus the nudity of the former and the sense of humor of the latter.Maybe Madonnas ego is so big that she insists on continuing to prove herself as a competent actress.

After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress or octress as she might have pronounced it in The Next Best Thing, she still cannot get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent. And that is the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience.

You will not miss anything. Bruce Greenwood is wasted, Jeanne Tripplehorn is a prop, and Madonna is so awful, it becomes amusing. Why they had to butcher the original film into this mess, I will never know; guess they thought it was bankable. Madonna, as an actress, certainly is NOT.If you rent the original film from 1979, though, you will enjoy it, and the actors in it can actually act. 110.","label":0},{"index":1684,"txt":"For years Madonna has tried to prove not only herself, but the public eye, that she can act. Unfortunately, trying too hard while failing to shed her own persona does not mix well.She seems to fare better when she is NOT the star of any movie if you watch her in supporting performances in DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN 1985 or A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN 1992, she actually comes off looking good. Since the story revolves on other actors, the weight of the expectation is taken off her shoulders by default.The trouble starts when she is asked to be the star of a movie, regardless the genre. Being the focus of a plot that needs to be told in a visual way, whether it be good, mediocre or plain awful, she has to emote in ways that are akin to an actual movie performance as opposed to a video performance. This is the crucial difference between Madonna and, let us say, Bette Davis, or Meryl Streep. The latter two, even if the movie were to fail because the visual storytelling lacked some effectiveness in having us relate to it, or because the script fell short, or because the actress per se was just not at her moment, there would be an extra something in their performances that would elevate the movie from being a complete bomb. Both Davis and Streep have had their share Bette, having a longer career than Streep, in such fare as BUNNY OHARE 1971 and WICKED STEPMOTHER 1989; Streep in SHEDEVIL 1989. But at least there is been that naturalism in the way both attacked their roles that made us forget the banality of the movie and watch the performance.Madonna, on the other hand, not being an especially gifted actress capable of really letting us in on her ability to convey a persona other than herself, fares much worse, and even in the hands of someone as Woody Allen in SHADOWS AND FOG 1992, an inferior classic, she in her pat screen time seems stilted and a little stiff, maybe even nervous, as if she were aware of the cameras and crew and just could not let go.So here she tries yet once again to prove she can act in what is essentially a twocharacter movie. Guy Ritchie, more known for action movies filled in masculine energy, seems as adrift telling a story closer to someone of the likes of Michaelangelo Antonioni or Ingmar Bergman, who could tell a tale of two people with incredible ease. And at 89 minutes, the events which take place happen in such an unconvincing way that when the final half hour comes along and the story takes a dramatic turn, it does not feel sincere. From being an absolute witch with no redeeming values to suddenly being in love, this has to be the most unconvincing 180 degree turn since Fay Dunaways Laura suddenly discovered her passion for Tommy Lee Jones in THE EYES OF LAURA MARS 1978. Equally unconvincing is Adriano Gianninis nasty turn around the middle of the movie  it lacks any humor and feels genuinely psychopathic  and when he gives in to Madonnas love, it is too quick to be believed. Filming this in slow music and a visual montage of lovemaking and beautiful scenery does not enhance or add upon this transformation from what would have been a story of survival between to unlikeable characters to a love story where both discover each other.Trying to have an unsatisfying ending works against the movie as well  it only makes it drag, bog it down, and when Madonna has to be filmed going from hope to devastation in a tight closeup, it feels she is trying too hard. Many an actress have done better in conveying so much doing so little. Hers is a performance more suited to acting styles of the late 20s, early 30s where posturing compensated as acting a part or an emotion.Could the movie have been better? Of course. There are a myriad of ways to have filmed it in a way that would leave the viewer feeling that these people could at least hope to see each other again  it is been done before, in OVERBOARD 1987, for example. It could have had an existential undertone in which two very different people have to rely on each other but not necessarily change to ensure a moral tone. Much dialog and unnecessary erotic scenes could have been spared for a more silent film look  as in PERSONA 1966. It could have even been something of a thriller, providing that the Giannini character have a mean streak as Billy Zane had in DEAD CALM 1989. Even if it would have been done as a sex farce it would have worked better for Madonna as the over the top, ubercontrol freak getting her comeuppance. But with its mean streaked humor, without at least a glimpse of her character having a softer side that hides behind a mask of bitchdom, and without really defining Gianninis own character, this becomes another misfire trying to look like a battle of the sexes.","label":0},{"index":1685,"txt":"I really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been unkindto it to say the least... but it was terrible.

Or perhaps they already have, since this film was largely dumped, with little fanfare and deadly wordofmouth. One would hope that being directed by her talented husband, who is created some interesting andor terribly entertaining work, would bring out the same quality Madonna showed in Desperately Seeking Susan; alas, it just is not meant to be, for here she is, at her very worst singularly convinced of her own greatness, the smugness permeating every frame she is in, made all the more unbearable by her wavering fauxBritish accent, an accent that only underscores the fact that her speaking voice is immature in quality and not especially pleasant. This may sound unnecessarily cruel but LISTEN to the woman, and LOOK at her films of, say, the past decade like a latterday Bette Davis, there is an unmistakable brittleness to not only her carriage but to her very face and body, which here, despite the warm photography displayed throughout the film perhaps its only saving grace, are done no favors. To her credit, the entire affair is so misbegotten that one wonders if the worlds greatest actress on her best day could do anything with this mess. No one involved escapes unharmed Bruce Greenwood actually seems pained to be onscreen, though poor Jeanne Tripplehorn seems to carry herself as if she is actually in something good, which had me thinking all the while, Denial as not just a river in Egypt! Adriano Giannini, son of Giancarlo Giannini, star of the Italian original, Swept Away..., is, like his father before him, immensely attractive, and is not altogether bad despite winning a Razzie nomination for Worst Actor, but, like almost everything else about this production, it all comes back to Madonna, on whose shoulders rest the blame. Why her? Why not her husband, director Guy Ritchie? Just who do YOU think was behind this remake? What actress would not want nearly every shot of a movie to be centered on her, with only a relative nobody sharing the screen? Oh sure, Ritchie deserves some blame surely he  or someone  ANYONE!  should have, and could have, taken his lead aside and insisted on something bordering on ACTUAL FEELING in her line readings for her performance is so wooden it is a surprise the rest of the cast did not get splinters, or at least display a semblance of warmth...but she seems resistant to be anything but a cinematic black hole. Above and beyond anything else, this is strictly a vanity project for its star so she is ultimately accountable for it. A film like this, an Odd Coupleish, war of the classes, should be light and fun, with leads who can bounce off one another with witty, even romantic, dialogue, for what else can a film whose plot involves two disparate people stranded, really be?

For example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw, Igor upon seeing this, yells out Paul! No Paul! Whyd you do it? I could have cut her clean! So clean! In another scene Igor tells a victim that she would have to get her own tools for surgery because right now, it was his time to operate. Aside from the bad acting, the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax, which is Igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed, he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining good guys. The movie offers no explanation of this, only telling the viewer that Igor escaped from the mental hospital. What??? Bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie. I wish I could get back the moments I lost watching this.","label":0},{"index":1692,"txt":"Igor and the Lunatics is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazyhippiecultkillingspree horror movie.

There is a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display \u0096 which is not bad \u0096 but it is all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at. Igor and the Lunatics is so desperate that it is even using a lot of the footage twice, like the circle saw killing for example. The incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drugaddicted and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul. One of Pauls lower ranked disciples, named Igor, becomes a little bit too obsessed with the Bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity. Just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy Igor is he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitchhiker girl! There is an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudoartistic camera tricks, like slowmotion footage and lurid dream sequences. Maybe there is one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete.

They do not really appeal to me, so I could not find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale. It seems like something straight out of the 1980s, a different age when this would have gone straight to video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do OK work with a weak script and a tedious scenario. But what is Gillian Anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year? The director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a nearrape and by his work on documentaries, but even that is not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up Dyer.

FilmFour and Verve take note is this really the best you can do? What are independent British filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement? It is a big blot on both of your reputations. Listen carefully can you hear the thousands of fans of independent British films crying in despair?","label":0},{"index":1704,"txt":"WARNING Contains MANY SPOILERS!Let me start by saying I have a huge respect for Gillian Andersons incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress  which is why I cannot comprehend her reasons for agreeing to make this film once she saw the script or lack thereof. The premise of the film was, in my opinion, a great idea and there were some genuinely thoughtprovoking themes in there but it ended up like a collapsed souffl\u00e9. It exemplifies why I hate 99 of British cinema. It feels too long, it is tedious, for the most part, and not a lot happens after the first twenty minutes. Just when you think there is a chance of it picking up some speed it disappoints like Paula Radcliffe running a marathon. With little imaginative directing and a minimalist plot, there is not much to keep the audience from nodding off into their popcorn. As for the script I can only surmise that the writer was trying to save a few trees, with the average scene reading something along the lines of Alice F OFF! Adam stares. Adam runs off into woodsAlice follows Alice ADAM! ADAM! I suspect that, word for word, the actors probably got paid more than Kate Moss did for her Virgin Mobile adverts. What few lines there were did not have a lot of variation with a frequent use of the fword that would make Bridget Joness friend, Shazza, proud. There is little establishment of the main characters before the main sordid event which leaves the audience lacking much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic Oh that is terrible reaction.Alice is not the kind of woman who courts sympathy either. She is got a great job, an expensive London apartment with roof space to die for yet she comes across on screen as conceited, bitter and dissatisfied before her life takes a turn for the worst. After the attack a few layers are peeled back which sortof explain why she is this way to start with; she grew up with a toughasoldboots soldier who thought that teaching her how to shoot his gun was the ultimate expression of love so, instead of following in his footsteps, she ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel like her life is worth living. Instead she found a group of stereotypical middleclass Toffs who look down on anyone not rich enough to drive a Lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated securityentertainment system i.e. becoming Mrs Robinson to a wannabe Cockney wideboy electrician Someone pass me a tissue. The one saving grace of this character is that she is played by Gillian Anderson. In the hands of a lesser actress she would have been intolerably onedimensional but Ms Anderson actually manages to inject a few fleeting moments of humanity into this otherwise lifeless human being, most notably when she is sincerely apologising for her road rage in a vain attempt to stop her attackers from continuing their assault.I cannot say that Adam fared much better either. Danny Dyer played him well as a fishoutofwater Jack the Lad but a good performance could not save him from both the lack of a script and the total absence of any character background. This film relied mostly on shock value but the timing was off and it felt far too engineered from beginning to end. As for the shock, the most shocking thing about this film is the unashamed demonstration of how painfully thin Ms Anderson has become; it was almost as unsettling to see as the brutal attack scenes. On a side note, only in a British film would a gang of violent sex attackers take the time to offer each other contraception before continuing to cheer their mates on  talk about stiffupperlip taken to the extreme! If this is the kind of film that the National Lottery is donating money to make then I am not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pound each week.

After a stupid accident in the countryside, they are brutally attacked. After recovering, and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers, their thoughts turn to that of revenge...I thought Straightheads was terrible. Violent, brutal, misogynistic and unpleasant. If I did not dislike the phrase a great deal I would call Straightheads a video nasty. Certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980s. Frankly I do not know how Straightheads got a cinema release.I am not a prude. I do not mind sex and violence in the movies, but they have to be married to a movie with a a good plot or b good characterisation or c preferably both. Straightheads had neither. No progression in the plot or the characters and too much left unexplained and unsaid. Luckily Straightheads went nowhere fast. It was only 80 minutes long.It was a shame, because there was the germ of an interesting film here, with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third.

Had this film come out of Italy in, say, 1975, been directed by Ruggero Deodatto and starred David Hess, then I would be lapping it up faster than Labrador drinks water on a summers day. Because whilst Tarantino and Rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their homage to grindhouse cinema, Dan Reed has produced a raperevenge grindhouse picture of his very own in England, and on seemingly the same budget as it would have taken Rodriguez to turn Rose McGowans leg into a machine gun. Because if you want to play grindhouse bingo, then let me call out the numbers 1. Rich, high flying career woman meets a bit of rough from the wrong side of the tracks in an implausible manner and, equally implausibly, gets the hots for him. Check.2. Gratuitous shots of said highflying career woman in various states of nudity. Check.3. Convoluted and highly unlikely plot development that sets up characters that exist solely to do what they do and who cannot be imagined to have any existence outside the scenes they are in. Check.4. Unnecessarily graphic rape scene perpetrated by a gang of males with no discernible depth of personality or background other than they are there to rape. Check.5. Gritty and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to round it all off. Bingo! Plotwise, Straightheads is pretty basic stuff Dyer meets Anderson and she invites him to a party at a country pile owned by her boss. On the way home, they upset three locals in a Landover who take their revenge by giving Dyer a good shoeing and gang raping Anderson. The couple then set about getting their revenge. So far, so Straw Dogs, Late Night Trains, House on the Edge of the Park, I Spit On Your Grave etc etc. So why did not I think much of this film? A number of reasons I suppose first off, having the likes of Gillian Anderson in the cast prima facie lead me to expect better, but it is the complete lack of honesty here than rankles most.Because whenever anyone sits down to watch Hess and his ilk terrorising women and murdering their menfolk in those period pieces from the 70s, then they always know exactly what they are getting  low budget quickies designed solely to shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator. The baddies terrorise and murder the goodies, the goodies turn the tables on the baddies and kill them back, and everyone goes home satisfied, their desires to see a bit of nasty violence slaked and safe in the knowledge that the world order had been restored.As writer and director however, Dan Reed clearly believes Straightheads has far more to say on the state of the human psyche than that, and desperately tries to imbibe his film with a philosophical depth that is simply not there. For instance, when Anderson and Dyer are planning revenge on their attackers, they learn that one of the rapists has a fourteenyearold daughter who is an object of lust for the two men he hangs around with. When Anderson finally meets him face to face, he confesses that he only raped her as a distraction so that his two mates would take their attention away from his daughter!!! The casual and audacious way that Reed drops this little revelation into the plot is simply jawdropping, it is almost as if he expects this simple reference to paedophilia to be enough to throw the audiences moral compass into overdrive and make them leave the cinema thinking they have just sat through something of significance. To make sure we get it, at this point we are shown a run through of the rape sequence for a second time, ostensibly from the view of the attacker and his concern for his daughter, but Reed ensures that we get plenty more shots of Anderson roughhandled and raped across the bonnet of her car. Gratuitous does not enter into it.After being told his reasons for raping her, Anderson ties him over a table, rams the business end of a sniper rifle complete with bulky silencer, just in case anyone was not clear on the phallic imagery up his jacksie but lacks the courage to pull the trigger, telling Dyer who has no such moral qualms that it is over. Dyer argues otherwise and their moral dilemma is presented as something that Wittgenstein and Russell may have discussed in their rooms back at Cambridge over tea and cakes. It is almost unwatchable in its ludicrousness.In fairness, Ms Anderson acts her guts out throughout the film. It is obvious she wants to leave Scully far behind and, bless her, she certainly does that; one wonders what Mulder would have made of his erstwhile partner squatting down to take a leak at the side of the road and then sodomising a man with a gun? Dyer, on the other hand, does what he is done in virtually every film he is made to date  that is, plays a gor blimey guv cockney type chappie with a roguish grin, a cheeky line of patter and a face that most people would never get tired of punching. This is particularly true at the closing scene where, after murdering his assailants in cold blood, Dyer gazes at the camera in, what I am sure is meant to be, a look of existential anguish that invites us to sympathise at the hand fate has dealt him and the moral quandaries he has had to overcome, but instead is far more reminiscent of Oliver Hardy looking exasperatedly at the camera after Stan has landed him in yet another fine mess. Which incidentally, sums up this film quite nicely.","label":0},{"index":1707,"txt":"I would been following this films progress for quite some time so perhaps expected a little too much. I consider both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer to be good at what they do and was interested to see what Dan Reed could come up with but unfortunately it just did not work for me.The problem lies in the fact that the film does not really seem to understand which genre it is falling into and as such it fails to impress on drama, horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well it is a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none.The premise as with most revenge films is simple, couple meet and go out, something bad happens and they get their revenge it is a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years. Unfotunately in this case it is as if Dan Reed thought, It would be great to do one of those revenge films that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail.... Wrong! There are also a few key elements missing, in this type of movie there is generally some kind of warning. A do not do this or this might happen element which adds to the tension but there is nothing of the sort here. It just simply happens, then nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting happens and then it ends.There is a lot of really stiff competition in this genre and hats of to Dan Reed for trying, I have no issue with his directing abilities but in term of writing...

Rather it feels like something Pete Walker might have turned his hand to, yet even in saying that I am probably being a bit unfair on Pete Walker.Revenge is a powerful human desire, but The Bedroom Window has more to say about that and male emasculation than this pitiful effort.I do not think it is particularly misogynistic, merely too gleeful in its depiction of certain details  the blood running down GAs leg post rape, par example.

It is amazing how stuff from the 80s is so funny now, but nothing is funnier than 80s rap videos. There was this rap group singing that song Dream Warriors on the VHS version of this movie after the credits, and they are all wearing like denim jackets with no shirt underneath and form fitting jean shorts that are all frayed at the bottoms like Daisy Dukes. What could make a rap group look more foolish I cannot imagine.spoilers At any rate, I was disappointed in looking for that video on the DVD version, so all I had was this mediocre installment in the Freddy Krueger series. The movie sort of starts off with the same idea as part 2, with the main character witnessing all kinds of gruesome murders and then sort of coming out of a trance and finding himself with the bloody hands. Kristen Parker Patricia Arquette has a nightmare about the infamous house that Nancy Thompson used to live in, then runs to the bathroom, the sinks handles turn into Freddys hands and attack her, and then she wakes up standing in her bathroom having slit her own wrists. From there, the movie turns into the usual mental hospital installment. Larry Fishburne, tired of always playing the bad guy in his roles, was happy to take on the role in this film as a niceguy orderly, stern but accommodating when the patients want to bend the rules a little. Not surprisingly, he turns in what is by leaps and bounds the best performance in the movie. Arquette later goes on to become an accomplished actor, but had not perfected her acting skills when she starred in this film. The characters in the movie are mostly all patients at the mental hospital that Kristen is placed into after cutting her wrists. All of them are cynical and uncooperative, almost none believing that they really belong there at all. Eventually, they realize and are able to convince the staff that they are all having dreams about the same man and it is not just some kind of group hysteria.Heather Langenkamp has returned in her famous role as Nancy Thompson, this time grown up into a dream researcher as a result of her childhood experiences involving Freddy Krueger. Not surprisingly, she is able to quickly relate to the hysterical Kristen and the rest of the patients, since she had experienced exactly what they are going through. There are some interesting murders in this installment, and the technology used for the special effects have taken a huge jump. There is a gigantic, wormlike Freddy that tries to swallow Kristen whole, there is a scene where a television turns into Freddy and with mechanical arms he picks up one of the patients there for some late night entertainment and punishes her for sitting too close to the TV, but there is also an unconvincing gomotion scene where a couple guys have a fight with Freddy Kruegers skeleton, which has been rotting in the trunk of some car in a car junkyard. And one of the more groaninducing scenes was one where Freddy attacks one of the patients in his dream the one famous for sleepwalking, tearing the muscles and tendons out of his arms and legs and leading him around like a puppet. Ouch.We get a peek into Freddys past in this installment. Not only do we meet his mother, but we also find out the circumstances that led to Freddy being fathered by more than 100 maniacs. In fighting Freddy, the patients all band together and, in their dreams, use their special powers most of which reflect their shortcomings in real life to fight him. One student, bound to a wheelchair, is able to walk in his dreams, another has the hilarious powers of what he calls the Wizard Master, another is beautiful and bad she has lots of makeup, her hair stands up in a foothigh Mohawk, and she has knives. Clever, but the movie falters when it has only one of the patients, the one who cannot speak, not have any powers in his dreams until the climax of the movie, when he suddenly realizes that he can talk in his dreams at just the right moment to save the day. His dream power was a little too obvious to have been left out for that long, but collectively, now you see why the movie was subtitled Dream Warriors.Altogether, this is not an entirely weak entry into the series. The acting is pretty shoddy, but it is actually pretty good for a horror movie. Larry Fishburne vastly overshadows the rest of the cast, displaying wonderful acting skills early on in his career, and the movie is not simply a rehash of either of the first two \u0096 a problem that plagues the Friday the 13th movies much more than the Elm Street films. The characters are never developed enough to allow for the later creation of much tension, which is why most of the deaths come across more as creative ways to kill off someone in a horror film than the tragic loss of the life of one of the characters that we have come to know and root for their triumph over evil. But then again, not a lot of horror movies take the time to really develop their characters to the point where you throw up your hands in defeat when they are killed, or are on the edge of your seat as they run for their lives. But it is important to note that the few horror films that actually do that are almost invariably the best ones\u0085","label":0},{"index":1718,"txt":"what kind of sht is this?

Somehow I found Nic Cages character offputting. Way offputting. Then the plot did not seem to make sense. Then by the end of the credits, the question came to mind What point was this movie making? What was it saying? The answer, unfortunately, was not much, if anything. I really do not think this movie aimed at making a statement; unless it was your life is your life, you are gonna make the same mistakes no matter what, so keep your eye upon the doughnut, and not the hole. Not a very profound statement, and I am sorry, not profoundly made in this movie. The writing simply is not that good. The direction is uneven, and is strangely overblown at times. Kathleen Turner was the best, and in my opinion, only worthwhile thing in this movie, and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre, unexplained circumstances, with a script that had no apparent statement to make. She also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason I did not enjoy this movie more. She states in her autobiography that Cage made a point of fighting his uncle Coppolas direction every step of the way, doing it his own way not a good idea for a new actor, and putting on a goofy voice she called stupid. His voice was annoying, abrasive and unnatural, and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy. I understand what he was attempting to do play a youngguy hot shot who is not as hot as he thinks he is, setting up his own karma for future failure. But he goes overboard, the way he does it is abrasive, not effective, and if he had listened to his uncle instead of fighting the Man, we would have had a more enjoyable film. Cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person, and those scenes are more watchable than others. But if I had to watch the movie through in its entirety, I would find myself wanting to pay someone in L.A. to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected puton scenes. The movie does not aim for a statement, does not make a point, is great to look at except when Cage is doing a demented Elvis impression but without the voice, and is, ultimately, confusing and a waste of time. Given all this, Kathleen Turner surely deserved an Oscar in this flailing mess of a movie. I cannot recommend anyone spending two hours watching this, unless you like Turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes. Believe me, you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes, and it will make just as much sense. Kathleen Turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her Cage comments, which proves that she is strong enough to be honest, and to hell with other peoples comments. You go, Turner! I am not particularly a fan of this actress any more than I am of any other firstrate actor or actress, but her candor is refreshing. Cages acting can be good to annoying, and here it does not work.

Considering their excellent track record, it will undoubtedly be a major improvement over all previous releases. And do not pay attention to the ridiculous cover shown here, it is not taken from this film some girl holding the head of a Jim Carrey lookalike.Spaghetti Western star Anthony Steffen sports a hip hairdo and assumes the role of Lord Alan Cunningham, a man haunted by the memory of his dead wife Evelyn. This leads to a nervous breakdown which has him being retained in a psychiatric clinic. Once released, Cunningham channels this trauma by taking redheaded prostitutes to his countryside castle, subjecting them to vicious acts of torture. His doctor and friend, Richard Timberlane what do you mean, Italian horror names sound made up?, advises him to forget the past and remarry but Cunningham is obsessed with Evelyn and even organizes a s\u00e9ance at the castle. Eventually, after killing some more girls, he meets Gladys, another redhead, and marries her almost immediately, but the arrival of his new wife spawns a series of sinister events. Bloodthirsty creatures strike at Sir Alans family, killing them off one by one. Becoming more distraught, Cunningham visits Evelyns tomb and discovers it to be empty. Soon, a number of outsiders begin to suspect something fishy is going on in the castle and Lord Cunninghams treatment might not have been that successful after all.Director Emilio Miraglia tries to blend Gothic horror with Giallo conventions with limited success. As usual, not the slightest effort was made to convince audiences the film is set in England. The cars drive on the right side of the road, everyone looks very Mediterranean and the castle and the rest of the architecture is patently Italian. This is common practice in Italian horror, but sometimes they just take this a little too far. The bad print made this even slightly bearable, since it is so dark, you could not see much of the surroundings anyway. But, then again, this is the kind of film where anything can happen in the name of exploitation and depicting reality is not really the issue. A large part consists of sadomasochistic torture scenes in the castle torture chamber, but most of the time, Anthony Steffen hams his way through this and shows some horrible overacting. I guess it all depends on your state of mind and this can be a fun piece of nonsense if you are in the right mood. I just could not take it, at least not with the print I watched.

I have to be honest and say I just did not really care much for this film. It is badly uneven and the pacing is all over the place. It looks great on the new DVD and the rising from the grave sequence is cool, but what really hurts the film in my mind is that the entire cast is unlikable. You really have a hard time caring for Alan because he is a psychotic who is skating on thin ice in regards to holding his sanity. He can be quite volatile. Who commits the crime really is not that great a surprise for after several key characters are murdered off, there are not but a choice few who could be doing it. What happens to Alan does not really make your throat gulp because you can make the argument he is just getting what he deserves. Those behind the whole scheme of the film in regards to Alan, as I pointed out before, are not that shocking because if you are just slightly aware of certain circumstances..or advantages they would havethat would benefit them with the collapse of Alans sanity, then everything just comes off less than stellar.

Anyway, soon, under the advice of his playboy uncle Roberto Maldera, De Teffe settles down with a girl he meets at his uncles party. She moves in and strange things begin to happen to De Teffes fragile state of mind. He begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally, well, just look at the title if you are still curious. Also, family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions. Poor Aunt Agathashe looks like she might even be younger than De Teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old meets her fate in a foxy fashion. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And of course, there is a whole explanation as to whyhow Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does do some things fairly well the settings in the film are wellsuited for this film though trying to make us believe it is England is ludicrous at best. None of the actors look English. Many having dark black hair and Mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an Englishman would not be caught dead in. The cars drive on their wrong side of the road. But all that notwithstanding, the crypt scene was effectively shot and I liked the cheesy resolution too. And of course any film with the sultry, redheaded Erika Blanc is always a plus. There is a streak of sexual perversion; however, which I found somewhat appalling with the idea that torturing women was quite alright and healthy in order to relieve one of his mental demons. Cmon.","label":0},{"index":1738,"txt":"So far after week two of The lone of Beauty I am a little disappointed.Some of the acting is good, as long as we except that it is only drama.I am unsure how people can feel that this FICTIONAL DRAMA is factual coverage of the Thatcher years  it is okay as drama, but I feel the award winning book is still much better.I Wonder if the BBC will ever give us the follow up and the next part of the drama and the years that follow with Things Can Only Get Better finishing with 2006 and the Fact that we are still waiting! with that promise from a Government that is full of sleaze.","label":0},{"index":1739,"txt":"Perhaps I could not find the DVD menu selection for PLOT ON OFF.

I admit that the acting is excellent, it is beautifully shot and I was reasonably entertained by it  however I found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very unsatisfied with this rather empty production.

The older men are opinionated, rightwing Thatcherites whose behavior brings back all the acrimony of the ReaganThatcher years. Young or old, however, morals in this threepart miniseries are universally suspect and no one comes off particularly well.Nick is a handsome young gay man fresh out of Oxford. It is not pivotal to the story, but he has an extraordinarily beautiful head of hair which makes watching this drivel much easier. Nick comes to London with a friend, whose father Gerald is a rich conservative politician, and babysits his sister Cat while the family frolics in the south of France. They neglect to inform him that, when upset, Cat cuts herself with an assortment of knives and other kitchen implements. Nick mistakes their selfserving gratitude for affection and moves in, finding out too late just how much they despise and patronize him. Inexplicably, Nick lives in this house for four years but, as the plot depends on this point, it is best not to question it.While Nick is most pleasing to look at, he is unbearably obsequious. His coy subjection to rich bigots soon had me climbing the walls. Deeply closeted except to Cat she guesses his big secret on sight, he does like a little anonymous sex just so we know he is actually gay. Though it hardly seems possible, Nick takes a lover who is even more closeted than he.Supercilious Tories scorn and insult the two blacks in the film, so imagine the venom which spews forth when Nicks sexual orientation is reported in a tabloid. Gerald, in true Tory fashion, has become involved in several personal and financial scandals, so the revelations about Nick add to his embarrassment. This gives Gerald one final opportunity to roundly castigate the hapless boy.Except for one brief moment of indignation, Nick takes the abuse heaped upon him in silence and tacit agreement.

It is the first film I have ever seen where I have shuttled at speed through parts of the nonaction  and I can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to SerboCroat indie and find them fascinating.The Tenants is frustratingly sluggish and overorchestrated. One of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue, apart from the set pieces where characters collide in a very structured setting to make this work, the film needed to feel more conceptual, which it did not. This leads to a lack of realistic character development; everyone seems twodimensional.The worse for this is the character of Bill Spear, aka Snoop Dogg. I found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic. At one point, I even stopped the film because I got so annoyed by the characters aggressive, violent and monotonal delivery, the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the reactionary on switch which gets really predictable after a while and I so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities. However, one reason for this jar might be the nebulous time scape of the film supposedly 70s, it feels and looks more early noughties. If it had been more securely fixed in the 70s, his character might have seemed more understandable.The lighting of the film was also awkward. All the way through, the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty, jazzinfused atmosphere that just did not come off, largely because the set was too welllit.The Tenants, to me, is an unbelievable film. It does not depict real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race, identity or the life of a writer, be they white or black.Strangely, I came away with the feeling that this project needed David Lynch; his eerie, clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable.","label":0},{"index":1744,"txt":"the intention the directors has for this films are quite honorable, but his history of his productions did get me aware that this might not get much to the core like other film makers would do it. keeping his great 30 days TV series in mind but also counting in his MTV production i bet you will that opposes his seriousness in any of the matters he documents and also counting in his rather disappointing production supersize me i did not had my hopes up high. sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less. as with supersize me after a while i did ask myself what exactly the point of all this was. the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the playtime gets filled with rather pointless stuff and rerepeating stuff that were already shown in this way or another earlier in the movie, so it wears out and gets extremely boring towards the end.","label":0},{"index":1745,"txt":"This film is just another distortion, among many distortions, on the socalled sins of consumerism.

Yes, America does have more than its share of problemsbut, with perseverance, Americans have and always make it through great difficulties. And, even in times of strife, America has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world. That happens when Americans pull together and unite, rather than to separate and divide. Yes, there are problems with corporations and monopolies, but it will take Americans to bring back the small businesses, along with the ethics to responsibly care for people living in our individual communities. Yes, globalization has brought us its share of problems, but it will take Americans to bring production back to America. Americans and the U.S. government need to learn how to stay on a budget, no matter how large or small it may be, and we must stop our dependence on credit. Our overreliance on credit will make, and keep us poor, from the cradle to the grave. It is important to buybut, if we buy less, we will rely less on credit. And, if we are able to save, even a small amount of money, we will have money for a rainy day. Not to say that, as Americans, we will gain an equal share of wealth. Wealth is not guaranteed, and has never been guaranteed. But, stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of Americans hold most of Americas wealth. There is a good proximity that you or I can reach the level of the upper, middle class. And, who knows what can happen from there?!? Be positive, work hardand, at the very least, you and I will be able to reach at least some if not all of our dreams. In life, nothing is guaranteed, but we always have that something to reach for. And, if you or I do not have dreams, we might as well be dead. In America, there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams. As individuals, we are a part of the pack, but we always can become the leader of the pack.It has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions, but I pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs, values, and perspectives. But, as far as the distortions expressed, within this film, I do not have any faith in such beliefs, values, and perspectives.

The performances are wooden, every sentence is an attempt at poignant in the way that housewifes daytime movies and bad soap operas always are, and it is based in that predictable and welltrodden premise that men particularly soldiers are essentially violent and incompassionate. The whole movie is about the drama apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension.If that sounds tolerable or even enjoyable to you, then be warned. Linda Hamiltons German accent, while quite good, is painfully distracting  as is her face, for some reason. The other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators, with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day. There are few surprises, but do watch for the Monty Pythonesque endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers knapsacks!I was not expecting action, but I had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged.

Understandably, I did not expect much. I thought the movie would include the typical array of Snoop Dogg related behavior and imagery often seen in clich\u00e9 rap videos. However, my generalization was for the most part wrong. Unfortunately, this did not make the movie any better.Most would describe the movie as a dark serious drama, whereas I would describe it as a dark seriously drawn out boring drama flick. The film tells a story of two struggling writers Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces. Their polar opposite lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship moves throughout the entire movie like a wild rollercoaster  most of which is contributed by Snoops character  reminiscent of someone with a severe case of split personality disorder.

There are some mediocre conflicts, but even they are mostly bogged down with more dialogue. The end, however, jumped at me with a sudden surprise. It was a little bit twisted, somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to wrap up a movie that needed to end.

Nobody expected this cosmic joke of a film, and nobody is more distraught about it than I am.This is by far the worst ANOES film of the lot. It does not seem too bad at the beginning, with a genuinely creepy intro and a rather elongated shower scene featuring Alice. But then we hit rock bottom right at the beginning with bad acting and a jumbled sequence of events. I mean, sure, Freddy movies are supposed to be dreamlike and creepy, but this one is like a trainwreck in it is poor sequencing of events and awful plot setup. It feels like you are coming down with a terrible headache, not like you are getting scared. So the directing totally fails. None of the suspense and well crafted horror from previous sequels is found here, and even the death scenes are mostly just crass and moronic the death by food especially, except for that one cool scene that is crafted like a comic book battle. That is why this movie gets a point.The storyline...lame, lame, lame, LAME. It was an excuse to gross people out and to make the MPAA mad, and nothing more.The acting...should I mention how Freddy has been turned into a childish boogeymanlike clown figure? How his rebirth scene made him look like a monster out of a 7 year olds horror book instead of the foreboding and nightmarish dream killer we have all known and loathed since the first film? That arm waving and stupid chuckling as he appeared again...ugh. And his one liners, too. Throughout the whole movie, they suck. Badly. A gradeschooler could come up with funnier stuff then the vomit Freddy spews throughout the 90 minute duration of the film. Hell, a chimpanzee could come up with much funnier lines than what Freddys been told to say here. Who wrote the script for this? This movie is really irritating, too. It seems so pointless. Like a gnat buzzing around your head, a gnat that just Will not go away. Freddy is just an annoyance now. We have seen him so many times before. This ones nothing different, and a lot of the time you just want him to take his awful oneliners and get off your TV screen. Alice, instead of the thoughtful and quiet girl from the last movie, seems annoying and very shallow, and this is obviously due to the horrible, horrible script this movie was fitted with. Lisa Wilcox may be a great actor, and sometimes it shines through the cracks here, but she cannot save this movie. The other actors just suck, mostly.The last 15 or 20 minutes of Freddys existence in this film are awful and embarrassing. I hope Englund was ashamed of this. Who wants to see Freddy running around like a mutated gorilla with his limbs stretched out, laughing like a cartoon villain? This movie destroyed anything positive I felt for the Nightmare series. I cannot ever watch them again without this image running through my head; of the mangled cartoon abomination that Krueger became. He was slowly becoming a jokey, retarded pop culture icon, but this is the lowest of the low. This is rock bottom. Nobody will ever take Freddy Krueger seriously again after seeing this film. He is naught but a joke, a clown that is long overdue for retirement. Pathetic.Of all the movies I could hate, why did it have to be Nightmare on Elm St, a series which I once adored and liked a lot? The Dream Child represents the death of a legend, and the shattering of any hope I had in the Nightmare on Elm St. series. Freddy would go on to continue his downward spiral into clown status in the next installment, Freddys Dead which was more entertaining than this was, actually, and then he would go on to bring down the mood in Freddy VS Jason, and finally he would putter out into nothing, which is for the best.I know this has mostly been a rant about why Freddy sucks now, but this movie is overall, horrible, and one of the worst movies ever made.

Leslie Bohems story never gets off the ground and Stephen Hopkins direction is so bad, that it makes my grandmother look good! The whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic. It is also confusing and pretty stupid. Avoid Part 5 at all costs!","label":0},{"index":1768,"txt":"I am still trying to determine whether the previous installment was worse than this one, or vice versa. Being that it is nearly fifteen years since I saw this film, the fact that I remember so little about it does not bode well. Perhaps it is simply because I only watched it once or twice, but I doubt it. If there was anything worth remembering about this film, you can rest assured I would remember it.At the time this film was released, the franchise was still entering its dying phase, so a lot of media coverage was allotted to it. It is never a good sign when teenie pop magazines contain explanations of the plot basics. One such article had to explain that Freddy was left too weak to infest the dreams of grown humans, so he decides to go after Alices unborn son. So far, so good, but this is the job of the writer or the director to explain to the audience. It should not be left to some unrelated publication.Making use of the trivia given in part three about Freddys conception, one could half expect scenes that would lift this joke out of the horror for infants category, but alas, that was not to be. It goes to show the sheer idiocy of the American ratings system that a piece of Bharniesque garbage like this could get the same rating as a genuinely frightening piece like the original.By this time, the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career. Fortunately, or unfortunately depending on how you look at it, Lisa Wilcox was there to provide a quotient of competent acting. Or perhaps she just looks competent by comparison to the rest of the cast. Either way, given that her last role was in something called The All New Adventures of Chastity Blade, I doubt she really had anything else going for her. Even poor old Robert Englund has been in better productions than that in the past fifteen years.Given that box office returns were in a steady decline, and not just for this franchise, at the time, one would have thought that the studios would realize neutering their films does not make them more saleable. In fact, this particular film, like its immediate predecessor, was so neutered that not only did it fail to attract a new audience, both succeeded in alienating the core audience that originally supported the franchise. Despite this, part five must be given some credit for not having the bright, luminescent feeling that made part four so insulting to look at.I gave A Nightmare On Elm Street Part Five a one out of ten. By trying to appeal to everyone, or the MPAAs idea of everyone, it succeeds in appealing to noone. Like parts two and four, one could erase it from the continuity entirely, and nobody would notice the difference.","label":0},{"index":1769,"txt":"I consider this film one of the worst in the Nightmare series. It was so boring that I could not remember a thing 20 minutes after the film was over, it even tires me to write a review on it.Okay, 4 was a joke and Freddy was the joker. 5 tried to return to the roots of the series. It was darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4, which is a good thing, basically. They tried to shoot a horror film instead of a comedy. Unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and scares. Because of that Nightmare 5 The Dream Child is neither funny nor is it scary. What we actually get is a boring film with the usual bad actors maybe with the exception of Lisa Wilcox.The plot Freddy killing Lisas friends by using the dreams of Lisas unborn child has a good base but it just is not enough for 90 minutes of film. Sometimes the story gets very confusing maybe because there is not any and you cannot stop wondering what the filmmakers were aiming at. The screenplay must have had more holes than Swiss Cheese and the film therefore was very cheesy itself let me say that I do not like cheese though, even if I am from Switzerland.

The second part was disappointing and boring, and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman Freddy Krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes. This fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for admittedly great visuals, and one creepy scene, a flashback sequence to how Freddy Krueger came into existence. The rest of the film consists mainly of our razorclawed maniacturnedjokester yelling stupid oneliners, and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses, who desperately try to avoid falling asleep, because good old Freddy awaits them in their dreams. Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson, and a bunch of uninteresting crap, such as a superdumb eerie childrens rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel... In Short No originality, just a decline of the old formula, and an overload of painfully annoying jokes. My generous rating of 310 is due to the great visuals, and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel, Freddys Dead, which is awful beyond belief.

I cannot believe any company could even get people to work on a film like this. Full Moon has a number of awful films, but this has got to be the worst. First off, the plot does not exist. It is odd. It is like, they took an idea for the story, and kind of never really got around to developing it. They seemed to have just wasted a lot of time filming outside shots while the two heroes drove around in the desert, and Bradbury talks nonsense for about 10 minutes. There were two scenes in the movie when Dez and Dazzy are driving, and when Dez and Bradbury are driving where it just went on and on and on...it was almost like 2 music videos in the place where there should have been some dialog or action. They just drove for about 5 minutes, with nothing but music and shots of the surrounding landscape.Next, we come to the acting, which is simply horrible. First off, the girl who plays Dazzy is just a beast. She is so scary looking, I wanted to look away when she was on screen! Horrible casting. Then, you have the guy who played Dez, who could not act if his life depended on it. His crying is actually funny, and his madman antics are even funnier. The guy who plays the desk clerk at the hotel is just as bad, as is the guy who plays Bradbury. There was no acting that deserves any recognition in this movie whatsoever.The makeup effects...hmmm, can anyone say pathetic? The effects were so fake, they were laughable. The crazy little robot looking catepillar thing grabs onto someone, they cut away, and when they come back, the guy has a completely fake looking flesh wound. Nice. Did they run out of money on the makeup budget or what?! I must say the druggie chick who is in the one girls apartment...nice makeup there too. I think they were going for a drugged look, and I think she was supposed to have a black guy, but it looked more like cheap zombie makeup for halloween.This movie is just horrible from the start. The story is stupid and very, very unoriginal, the direction looks as tho it was performed by a 10 year old, the acting is the lowest of the low, and so on. STAY AWAY from this movie at all costs.

I did not understand why certain plot elements were even present why was the construction upstairs, why was there that big stairwell with a perfect spot for someone to fall to their doom if no one was actually going to do so, why have the scenes at all with the father at work, why have such a nice kitchen if you are only going to eat takeout, why would the boy want to be baptized and the parents be the ones to resist instead of the other way around.

While we were shooting, we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff. Mr Nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most illmannered men I have ever met.

The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess I came out feeling like I had been beaten over the head with the God this , God that and Christ is our saviour stuff. The movie and the story line did not need it. If , as I am , you are a recovering Catholic or Christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous.

The director had a good ideaintentions when making this movie but it could have been better. I can understand why someone would still have feelings for who they believe is the greatest love of their life. However, I did not understand why the director made his friends so insensitive, mean and rude. The main character kept apologizing to his friends when they were the ones mean to him. They were not understanding at all and they used God as a reason to explain their behaviors. The main character, nor anyone else did not know if the exgirlfriend was divorced, still married etc but they were against him resolving old feelings that needed to be dealt with. His friends were suppose to be Christians and should have been portrayed as being supportive whether they agreed with his decision or not. So many times we do things in life where we do not apologize to those we have hurt in the past and when he was trying to do this they were all against him. The ironic part was his new female friend accused him of having stalking behavior for simply looking up an old friend, when she did a really odd thing to get a hold of his name, address and phone number...she seemed to be the stalker!. she did not seem like a friend at all but was only looking out for herself. God is love...and I think God wants people to be with the person they were meant to be with and i feel the movie did a terrible injustice by making it seem like God does not care about true love...only that you stay with someone you made a bad choice with. We all make mistakes...it is all about what steps you take to make amends. Like I said the movie had potential but I was tired of the onesided point of view being constantly repeated and jammed down the viewers throat by his socalled...wellmeaning friends.

Most importantly and devastatingly , it changed our world.However, I cannot not stress how utterly repulsed, disillusioned, and angry I am at the careless, blatant ignorance of Hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction. This film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid wordofmouth among moviegoers and critics alike; most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press. Hollywood has sunk to a new low. Even lower than the lowdown bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty. Behind it all is Uwe Boll. I am very angry at this movie. How dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost? How dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy?!?!? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post911 world?!?!?! How...dare...they? To those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty, I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength Remember. Think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person. Think back to that day, ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day. Think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones.

Boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value the more offensive, the funnier, and the more exaggerated the funnier. This results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss. Yes, some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck. High points include the director satirizing himself, and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include..well pretty much everything else.After the initial surprise wears off, Postal simply becomes a bore to watch. Yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes, but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity.This probably would have worked as a short movie, but it is just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes although it feels twice as long.

Gabriel and his companion, Grace, have been asked by Prince James of Albany to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by socalled night visitors. When the son of Prince James is kidnapped, Gabriel pursues the night visitors to Rennes le Ch\u00e2teau, where he begins piecing together a mystery relating to the Holy Grail.Despite the marketing, this game is not about vampires. Vampires have a token appearance in the game, but never command center stage, as did the voodoo hounfor in Sins of the Fathers or the werewolves in The Beast Within. Gabriel and Grace make no attempt to uncover the true nature of vampires, or to research lore on vampires. Although the vampires do murder three people during the course of the game, their victims are chosen at random and have nothing to do with the main plot.A large part of the charm of the first two Gabriel Knight installments was in the relationships which Gabriel formed with the villains. Through these relationships, the player could not help but sympathize with the villain, and thus the villain was transformed into more of a human and less of a monster. However, in Blood of the Sacred, Gabriels only interaction with the villain is through a single, cheesy interview, which does nothing to endear the villain to the player.The roles that Gabriel and Grace play in this mystery are fairly futile. Gabriel spends his time snooping into the identities of members of a treasurehunter tour group staying at his hotel, but what he uncovers amounts to nothing more than a red herring. Grace spends her time researching the mystery of Rennes le Ch\u00e2teau, but all her research is rendered superfluous by the presence of a perplexing ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries.The actions of this perplexing ally and his polar opposite  the vampire leader  are insupportable. The ally leaves hints about the mystery of Rennes le Ch\u00e2teau in broad daylight and expects Grace and not the other treasure hunters from the tour group to find them. However, he could have revealed the mystery to Grace in its entirety on day 1, instead of putting the kidnapped child at risk for an additional 48 hours. And in the end, he simply tells Grace the mystery in its entirety anyway.Meanwhile, the vampire leader fails to achieve the goals of centuries of scheming, because he chooses to refrain from action for two days after the kidnapping of the child. The only reason given for his decision to delay action is that he wants to savor his victory.The game would have been much better had it been purely focused on the Holy Grail. The kidnapping and vampires should have been omitted, replaced with a race against the Vatican to uncover the mystery of Rennes le Ch\u00e2teau. Since Gabriel is portrayed more than once as reluctantly Catholic, this conflict would have had many opportunities for character development.All in all, the game was a disappointing installment in the series, despite an improved interface and the return of Tim Curry as the voice of Gabriel Knight.","label":0},{"index":1820,"txt":"SPOILERS I am always surprised at how many people gave this game good reviews. It was awful. The script and voice acting alone ruined it. Gabriel and Grace are the most unlikeable characters in the game. You almost pray for their deaths. And worst of all, there are less vampires in this game than there were werewolves in The Beast Within.The lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing. If you are expecting some kind of Anne Rice style vampire story, forget it. This games story has very little to do with vampires. You will not even see any till about the very end and even then, you will not get to fight them.The story has radical, and pretty much blasphemous, views of Christianity. I am amazed it got off the drawing board. I am not even Christian and I found it offensive. Mostly, the story centers around a search for The Holy Grail and buried treasure. The kidnapping of a royal baby, which should have been the focus, really gets pushed aside. There is no sense of urgency for Gabriel to find the baby. In fact, he almost never asks anyone about the baby after the first few time blocks.The graphics are pretty bad. The characters move about at a snails pace even on the best of systems. They are chunky and outdated. And it is hard to go from the FMV of The Beast Within to this horrible game engine for Blood of the Sacred.The relationship between Gabriel and Grace takes an awful turn, too. I really do not know why it was so horribly rushed, but they do sleep together. And it is not fun. Gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend Mosely how he thinks of Grace as more of a sister and he does not think she is the one for him. And he seems really grossed out that they slept together. But he is so unlikeable throughout the game, that you almost do not even care at that point. His dialogue was the worst in the game. And he was constantly making stupid sexual innuendos at anything female the entire game. By the end of the game, Grace leaves him with what appears to be a Dear John letter. I guess she was as fed up with him as most of the players were.I found the story to be annoying and boring. I was expecting to play a story of a royal baby who was kidnapped by vampires. And I was expecting to get to see and fight vampires, maybe even have Gabriel or Grace turn into one. But no. Instead, the story focused on the authors warped vision of Christianity. What a shame. Here they had the elements for a great adventure, and instead we got this.For me, the only interesting parts of the game were actually at the very end. We do get a few action style puzzles at the end. But it was not worth suffering through the entire game to get to them.I cannot really recommend this game. I had gotten it back when it came out, years ago, and I hated the game engine so much that I shelved it for years. I only recently dusted it off to see what I would been missing. And now, I am very sorry that I did. My favorite characters were ruined. I hope there will be a fourth game just to redeem the series. And I hope they get it right next time.

We never learn why these young men are friends. They may share confusions about the world and their places in it, but they do not seem to have anything else in common. Making his directorial debut, Jack Nicholsonwho also cowrote the screenplay with Jeremy Larner, based upon Larners bookdoes not introduce us to the characters with any clarity, nor he does shape the scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen. There are some very decent performances here particularly from newcomer William Tepper in the central role, but most of the picture is unformed perhaps intentionally, sketchy or unsure. Bruce Dern plays the harddriving basketball coach, Karen Black is the older, married lady Tepper is having an affair with, and Michael Margotta is Teppers wayward friend in an offputting, overthetop performance. Nicholson fails to set up the sequences with any particular flavor, preferring I assume to let the character interaction dominate the films tone; his script is no help either, and as a result it is unclear whom we are supposed to sympathize with. Small, random moments do work a supermarket fight between Tepper and Black, Dern visiting Tepper in his dormroom, all of the scenes set on the court, however the entire third act of the picture is an excruciating mess. Hoping to juxtapose an allimportant bball game with a sexual assault, Nicholson shows no style at his craft nor does he earn points for chutzpah, as his staging of these events is squashy and ugly. When a director goes out of his way to humiliate his actors, one has to question his motives in doing so.

How anyone can see art in this messy, cheap sexromp concoction is beyond me. Some of the stories here could have come straight out of a softcore porn film, and I am not even so much referring to the nudity but the simplistic and banal, often pointless stories. Anyone who enjoyed this relatively watchable but dumb oddity should really sink his teeth into the Der Schulmaedchenreport softporn German 70s movie series, because that is what Decameron looks like to me.Besides, the movie is sloppy on nearly all levels, from start to finish 1. Editing. An example at 1 hour15 minutes45 seconds there is a chasing scene that is put quite clearly in the wrong place. It was supposed to be placed about a minute later, but I guess that Pasolini must have hired boozedup editors who have little time for the fine details of moviemaking. Peepeepees fans would probably counter this by saying that it was placed there intentionally  which I very much doubt. Besides, even if that were true, that would be even worse, because that story gains absolutely nothing by making it harder to follow. This is not exactly Eraserhead or one of Tarantinos brokenform films... 2. Acting. Vey sloppy. Triple Pees fans all 8 of them proudly declare how 3PO uses real people instead of actors. Are not actors people? Or are they Martians? Sure, many actors have subpar IQs but does that mean we should treat them with contempt...? Other directors have used amateurs and succeeded such as Alan Parker or De Niro, so why are PPPs amateurs so utterly awful in his movies? The answer is once again appalling sloppiness. Pasolini is sloppy in everything, and that includes trying to get as much out of his toothless amateurs as he can. He is a lazy director, an IMperfectionist if you like. The antiKubrick, I suppose... Peepeepees principal goal when casting must have been to find as many toothless old people as possible and young men that are to his liking. In Pasolinis world there is a simple formula lack of teeth  strange face  realism. It is all well and fine to have them toothless, but at least try to eke out some at least semidecent performances out of these inexperienced neothespians, otherwise you are an amateur yourself  an amateur director, in Pasolinis case. Whether 3P0 was not capable of this feat or simply did not care does not change anything. Who knows... maybe he did not even notice the awful acting? 3. Audio. The synchronization. If 3P0 felt that microphones are too much of a hassle when filming a movie, then he ought to have at least made a concerted effort in postproduction, i.e. getting all these bum actors to say their lines on cue in the studio, so that we the viewers would not have to watch mouths move while the elusive dialogue floats elsewhere in the movie.4. Lack of concept. We have close to a dozen stories which are not connected in any meaningful way. Some are antiChurch more on that later, while some are merely sex yarns i.e. cheap male sometimes gay fantasies designed to titillate and nothing else. The stories and characters are not amusing if at all on an intelligent level, but on the basest level. 10 yearold kids can laugh here... And there is nothing wrong with that, but then do not call it exalted, intellectual art! 5. As a result of point 4, there is also a lack of logic in the order of the stories. That goes without saying. Peepeepee could have arranged the order in any other way, and we would have had the exact same movie. This also means that you can feel free to start from the middle then go back to the beginning, etc. Decameron is like a bowl of spaghetti that way when you start eating it you can begin with any thread you want, it makes no difference at all.6. The pointlessness of the stories resolutions. Most stories end with a cheap gagjoke, i.e. some damn dumb punchline straight out of a porn comicbook, whereas some stories do not even have a conclusion they merely end. Finito. At best, the stories are watchable semianecdotes, barely any deeper meaning there  unless you find deep meanings in a porno. There is, of course, nothing easier than looking for and finding meaning where there is an absence of it. Hence even any hardcore porn film can be philosophizedmused over endlessly. It is easy and fun. Try it, oh ye 8 PPP fans! As for the Churchbashing... Some viewers get all excited about his attack on Catholicism and whatnot. In principal, that is all well and fine  after all, I am an atheist myself  but what those people ignore is the simple but essential fact that Pasolini was a Marxist. It is like the pot calling the kettle black. A Marxist criticizing the Church for hypocrisy and stupidity? Where does he get the nerve? Besides, Pasolini was not an atheist, hence his highandmighty and selfrighteous stance is not justified. After all, Marxists are believers they merely substituted the accepted god with the idea of a Utopia, which is merely another supernatural wishfulthinking fantasy. Hence I cannot get excited about PPPs antireligion antics.This sophomoric humpdorama anthology ends with Pasolini saying rather pretentiously I wonder... Why produce a work of art when it is nice just to dream about it? He was not actually referring to this silly little movie as art, was he...? In case he was  the poor deluded man  then I have to wonder why he did not just leave it at dreaming, and NOT make all those bad movies...Wanna read my altered subtitles of Bergman movies?

And it is quite true that director Pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema. But it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual point.Pasolinis work is visually jarring, but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed, and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography. This is true of DECAMERON. Pasolini often preferred to use nonactors, and while many directors have done so with remarkable result, under Pasolinis direction his nonactors tend to remain nonactors. This is also true of DECAMERON. Pasolini quite often includes images designed to shock, offend, or otherwise disconcert the audience. Such elements can often be used with startling effect, but in Pasolinis hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film. This is also true of DECAMERON.I have been given to understand there are many people who like, even admire Pasolinis films. Even so, I have never actually met any of them, and I have never been able to read anything about Pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me. Judging him from his works alone, I am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not break the rules so much by choice as by lack of skilland who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day for  existential boldness, thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a film maker. I find his work tedious, unimpressive, and pretentious. And this, too, is true of DECAMERON. It is also, sadly, true of virtually every Pasolini film it has been my misfortune to endure.","label":0},{"index":1824,"txt":"The tragedy is that this piece of rubbish was part of my curriculum while I was studying cinema. So imagine how I was forced to watch it in complete. Believe me going through hell is much much easier. Our professor told us that this is some film ???, but he never thought that we would disagree or assume the apposite. I do not think that there is any gods on earth, we are only humans, so all the filmmakers, therefore they CAN make mistakes, bad movies.. Or very bad too. The main problem was not that art, by all means, is susceptible to endless points of view, but that a lot of people just do not get it, that every single human got his own genuine taste, his own opinion, hence what I suppose it the greatest movie ever made, can also be your worst one ever, and how that is right both ways, but how many people can understand this correctly?. So my professor believes in this movie, and simply I do not. However, the only way to evaluate this thing is by measuring it by its original intent to show us different kinds of old folk stories or whatever to catch on this societys mentality, imagination, and nature. To tell you the damn truth Mr. Pier Paolo Pasolini as the scriptwriter and the director made it too unbearable to watch in the first place. The movie is so UGLY. I cannot stand this, so how about analyzing it, then discovering the potential beauty in it !! It is beyond your mind hideousness, and strangely not for the sake of the movies case or anything, it is for the sake of the unstable vision of Pasolini. His work is so primitive to underdeveloped extent. The deadly cinematic technique, the effective sense of silliness, and the incredible horribleness made everything obnoxious. Look at the atrocious acting, the unfruitful cinematography, the awfully poor sets, .. OH MY GOD I have got the nausea already. It can terminate your objectivity violently as watching this movie is one true pain like taking the wisdom tooth off by a blind doctor. There are dreadful nightmares which could be more merciful than this. So originally, how to continue THAT just to review it fairly ? Actually, you do not.

A realistic view of Life within this world, it sometimes feels like a journey back in time.Given the depicted human element of its time, one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists  as well as the ironies of Life, at times. Or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the Catholic Churchs rules.Nothing terribly special, but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions.","label":0},{"index":1826,"txt":"Yeah, I get Pasolini and his milieu, but at the same time, I feel his Decameron is largely overrated, and more than a little disturbing. Overrated because the supposed realism he introduces milling crowds, crumbling architecture, etc. are mooted by the absurd and downright goofy way that the characters behave. In the pursuit of realism, Pasolini utilized many nonactors, but their deerintheheadlights stares and painfully awkward line delivery gives the whole a terribly offkilter and inconsistent feel. And frankly  many of the toothless, misshapenlyfeatured people are painful to look at.And Pasolinis Decameron is disturbing to me at least because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content. Not because I am prudish or homophobic I am neither but because the emphasis that Pasolini places upon homoerotic images and situations is contrary to the neorealism he otherwise espouses, so it comes off as gratuitous and forced. One can almost hear him say OohI have got to stick a cute, naked boy in this scene! At times it seems that Pasolini is trying to play up the homosexual angle to thumb his nose at critics, and at other times because he enjoys that aspect himself, regardless of what his audience might prefer.The disjointedness of the 9 or 10 different stories in Pasolinis Decameron struck me as being a failing of Pasolini as a storyteller, rather than being an aspect of neorealism. He seems to get bored with each story and so he wraps them up rather unconvincingly and with little conviction. Even the Pasolinis final line of dialog in the film, which some people seem to find pithy Why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much sweeter?  to me, it just makes me wonder why Pasolini would bother making a film if he felt this way? In my opinion, a far bettercrafted film and with MORE homosexual content is Fellinis Satyricon. It is also full of bizarrelooking people and absurd situations, but it succeeds because of its pacing, direction and strong storytelling whereas Decameron fails by those same elements.","label":0},{"index":1827,"txt":"This is a review of Freddy Mercury The Untold Story, theatrical release, Chicago Int.

I find mafia movies to be dull because I have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case, the Italian cinema, treat these guys as heroes. I saw the film and in a few days I will not remember much about it. Lots of shooting, innocent bystanders dying, betrayal, and that sick loyalty.

Antonio Sabato, then, makes for an unlikely gangster  apart from being a resistible leading man; his relationship with Savalas, which becomes paternal at the flick of an eye, is also unconvincing especially since he subsequently becomes romantically involved with the latters spirited teenage niece!

Alive combines the tension of Vincenzo Natalis Cube with Kitamuras own Versus. I have not seen Versus, so I cannot comment on that, but I think Cube was an excellent movie which I recommend to everyone. However, in this case someone has clearly confused tension with boredom.I will just go ahead and spoil the entire plot, because besides being one holy Swiss cheese of a plot, it is also moldy cheese, and the movie is not worth spending any time on even if you do not know the plot beforehand, so it does not matter. If I have misunderstood the plot, do not hit me  it is probably because I had to struggle to keep my eyelids open.So the American military in Nevada once lost a UFO i the Nambi desert. This apparently makes sense because they are both deserts so surely they are practically the same place. Different continents or not. A monkey broke into the UFO and acquired an alien something which was passed on to a Japanese researcher who had to eat the monkey to survive in the desert. What ever. The alien thing is now passed on to anyone who is bloodthirsty enough to kill the current host. The Japanese military wants to use it for military stuff, so they decide to make it pass from the current host the researchers daughter to some other dude. But instead of just picking someone out of the military, which is full of people who are bloodthirsty AND already on the militarys side, they decide that it is probably a good idea to pick some criminal out of death row instead. Oh, and the reason they pick this particular criminal from death row is because he was the first person in history to not die from the nonlethal electric shock which is the standard execution method, because everyone dies from the placebo effect when they get electrocuted. I do not know if they do this so they can giggle in the staff room at how everyone dies even though it is not deadly, or if they just want to cut down the electricity bill.Then the movie turns into what The Matrix would have been if it had been really lame, and superfluous fighting bores us to tears for what feels like an hour. And oh wait, now they remember that they already had a dude who was infected with the alien thing, so the entire movie up to this point was actually a totally waste of time and also human lives. Then everyone dies. The end.The only one moment in the movie where I did not want to go away and sleep or eat a sandwich instead, was when a dude was pinned to a wall by a pipe through his chest, and he is hanging around up there and another dude walks by. The dude hanging on the wall says I am in pain, shoot me. And the living dude looks at him, and it is not like he is a mean dude or anything, so he really looks sorrowful and does not want the guy on the wall to suffer. So he shoots him.Rhetorical pause.In the stomach.

Though they could not, they had to take all the same raunchy, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again. Though the thing is i did not laugh at it the first time. They tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level. Most of the time it is just randomly inserted jokes, that are so disgusting and raunchy that it is hard to watch it and enjoy it. Then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene. Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience, well i fit into the age range that it is supposed to be funny for. While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you do find this funny then you probably are not one of the more mature or intelligent people around. It does not take that much skill to write that kind of a script, though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie Spaceballs.

It is a slow moving film set like an episode of Wonder Years, with appalling lack of depth though. It also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner.The approach to the subject of painting is very elite, limited to vague and subjective terms as beauty. According to the makers of this movie, beauty can be only experienced in BobRossstyle kitschy landscape paintings. Good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic like, primary school level color theory and lots of sentiment. In parts the movie is offending, e.g. at a point it is stated rather, celebrated by dancing on tables that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting, their works by definition being worthless bullshit quote.I do not understand how the movie could get such high rating, then again, so far not many people rated it, and they chose for only very high or very low grades.","label":0},{"index":1852,"txt":"There are pretty landscape shots. Writers putting trite mouthings into actors mouths. With lesser actors this show would be silly. Art must uplift humanity or it is BS. Not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side. The lead character even says those who do not drink hide the shadow side. Wrong , he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not expanding his horizons with something other than landscapes. There was not a breathing organism in his work nor expression of his pain. All the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes. The discussions between the characters was grade school, trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted.

With the sometimes pointless excesses of many Hollywood films, we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions, foul language, and corny oneliners. Minimalism has its place, and can be very effective when employed properly. However, this film is not one of those cases.Take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary, sparse scenery. I am sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight, because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement. The acting is poor... bland and pedestrian... and features one of the worst crying scenes in history at the end of the film, if you can sit through it to the end. The scenery is drab, and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled. I would call this anticlimatic, but as the film did not build to any sort of climax whatsoever... not even in the erotic scenes... it would be untrue. I am sure that there was a script employed during the filming, but with the amount of dialogue, I think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin. Basically, this film offers nothing to interest or amaze... no great story, no stunning insights, no visual drama, no excitement.

Unfortunately, there is a subset of films within the drama genre that attempt to ride the coattails of good films while providing nothing of interest themselves. These are what I call IAN films \u0096 Incomprehensible Artistic Nonsense. Tsai Mingliang is the king of this subgenre, and Vive LAmour is his masterpiece. In fact, this is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of crapinfested garbage under the guise of art. People walk around in their apartments, drink water, stroll back and forth waiting for pay phones to become vacant, hang posters, staple papers together, go to the bathroom, eat, do pushups, have sex, slap at mosquitoes, etc. I am not joking when I say that is an accurate synopsis of the entire film, which is the quintessential posterchild for pointless arthouse trash. There is no plot, no storyline, no interesting or noteworthy events, no emotion, no meaningful dialogue, and most importantly \u0096 no drama.The most eventful scene has two people banging on a bed with a person masturbating underneath the mattress \u0096 ironic that it is also totally tasteless and gratuitous. The relationship of the characters on the bed is practically nonexistent. Tsai apparently did not feel like communicating anything to the viewer regarding these people other than the obvious fact that they like to bang. The person under the bed is just as onedimensional and uninteresting. He likes to drink water, makeout with melons, and stroke himself. This is Tsais idea of character development. A truly misguided entertainer indeed.Tsais true contribution in Vive LAmour is perhaps the most atrocious scene in arthouse film history. He first shows the lead actress walk all the way from one end of a park to the other for 285 consecutive seconds, only to then show her cry hysterically \u0096 for absolutely no reason whatsoever \u0096 for another 356 consecutive seconds. The film then abruptly ends. No point. No entertainment. Just pure, concentrated torture inflicted on the viewer. In an effort to beat a dead horse. The underlying theme of loneliness is mishandled so greatly that the only true feeling of this film is that of boredom. In fact, Kiyoshi Kurosawa provides a much better exposition on loneliness in his horror film Kairo. And guess what? It is actually INTERESTING! That film moved as slow as molasses in January, but there are better ways of addressing the concept of loneliness than the utter waste known as Vive LAmour. Kairo is a perfect example of that.Fans of cinema may thank Tsai Mingliang for directing this film, as he has provided irrefutable evidence that arthouse cinema can be just as poorly made as Bgrade, madefortelevision horror flicks. Arthouse snobs have now officially lost their pedestal of selfrighteousness. The quality level of your precious genre now overlaps films like Army of Darkness and \u0096 gasp! \u0096 Showgirls.

We were informed by our professor that it would be very funny to us, but the reason we were watching it was because it was one of the first sound films  a complete disaster.The problem with early sound films was that Hollywood actors only knew how to do silent movies and they were not good at memorizing lines. So producers and directors would look to the stage to get actors. Sounds like a great idea, right? Well, the kind of acting one does on stage does not show up too well on film. Most of the actors in Atlantic look and sound like they are acting in a play, which results in lots of hearty laughs at the overacting. Another limitation of early sound film was the technology of microphones. You could not move the mikes like you can today, you had to keep them static or it would pick up the sound of air moving through. There was usually one mike used in any given scene in this movie. In one particular scene, there is a man sitting at a table. Someone walks right up to him and delivers their line, then walks away. Another actor comes up from behind him, delivers their line, then walks away. It goes on like this for a couple more people. The microphone is obviously right by the man at the table, making for a laughable actor carousel.Those are only technical problems. If you get into the story and direction, then it gets even worse. The story is a fictionalized account of what happened on the Titanic. The characters are unbelievable and pointless. A story about a man cheating on his wife and their teenage daughter has no place in the movie. It is barely resolved and leaves you wondering why it was there in the first place. A lousy attempt at high drama, the actors take long, pregnant pauses between lines many times. It is tiresome, and you cannot wait for this 90 minute feels like 180 at least movie to get over with. I am not going to talk a whole lot about the issue of racism at this time in our country, but it really offended me that there were only two blacks in the whole movie, and they were portrayed as animals. They both pushed past the women and children to try and get in one of the lifeboats. They were ordered to stop or be shot, and of course they did not so they were shot. I was appalled.I give this movie a 210. I would have given it a 110 the lowest rating possible, but I gave it an extra point just because it was one of the first sound films, and I tried to put it into context. If you want to see a good early sound film, check out Alfred Hitchcocks Blackmail that also came out in the year 1929. You will find that the best directors were able to adapt to new technology immediately.","label":0},{"index":1860,"txt":"Yes I know talkies had just been invented for the cinema 2 years earlier when this was produced in 1929 but this film showed that much had to learnt about the art of producing films.It comes over as a filmed hammy stage play with the actors melodramatically enunciating their lines,rolling their eyes, using too many pregnant pauses and using gestures more appropriate to silent cinema, which I suppose was normal during the process of educating them to appear more naturalistic on screen.The gaps between lines spoken should have been tightened up during editing as it considerably slows the film.It is now only of interest for Titanic buffs who want to see an early example of this marine accident on film.In next chronological order they could see Titanic 1953 A Night to Remember 1958Titanic 1997, to see how the cinemas depiction of this tragedy as evolved over the years.There have been many documentaries and TV films made including the atrocious SOS Titanic 1979 On my version which is a DVD, David McCallum gives the introduction.It was he who played Harold Bride Marconis junior wireless operator in A Night to Rememberstill the best feature film  please read my Tribute to Walter comments on IMDb under Howard Morley.demon.co.ukand gave the commentary on the series of 4 videos entitled End of a Dream so he was well qualified to give the narration.Of more interest I found was a recording accompanied by actual photos of the 1912 US Senate hearing which is also on the DVD.Actors speak the actual words spoken by Lightoller 2nd officer, J Bruce Ismay,Managing director of White Star, Harold Bride and others including Gloria Stewart The old Rose in Titanic 1997 whose voice is used for one of the first class women survivors.","label":0},{"index":1861,"txt":"No movie with Madeleine Carroll in its cast could possibly be unwatchable. That said, I have to add that this British film comes close. The story takes place on board the SS Atlantic and it is loosely based on the Titanics unfinished voyage. The word unsinkable is spoken, the liner strikes an iceberg, and we hear a heavenly choir sing Nearer My God to Thee. The doomed passengers eventually take over the anthem, in a clever bit of sound work. But the year of the films release 1929 means that a modern viewer has to accept otherwise primitive sound and many of the acting conventions of silent films and the stage. These are not problems. The films major flaw is pacing, and pacing had been well developed in silents. However, if the dialog were delivered at a realistic speed, the movies running time would be cut in half. The intended effect was drama and clarity in a new medium, but the result unhappily is tiresome now. The films structure is preposterously illogical and inept. Paradoxically, I found certain details of the editing quite modern in technique fine, abrupt cuts from one area of the ship to another, sometimes even on sound effects. Although we are on board the Atlantic from the first shot, we were well over 4 minutes into the movie before I discovered that fact. There are long, intrusive musical passages by the ships dance orchestra. Entertaining, easy sound. Personal stories are presented in an utterly uninvolving and unconvincing way. Do not even think of spectacle. The berg is a tiny thing and the exterior damage it does to the ships hull is a minor dent. However, the scenes of passengers swarming into the lifeboats  clearly staged on a real liner, presumably tied up to a dock  generate great excitement. Other than the glorious Miss Carroll, these sequences are the films only points of excellence. As the movie and the ship near their end, the screen goes totally black several times when the power generators begin to fail. Their last, eternal blackout is the end of the film, with a sunsetsunrise tacked on, a clumsy symbolic effect. Atlantic is a cinema curiosity.

It is true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, but that does not mean that it is a pleasant film to watch.

With an AList cast, particularly the three leads and an experienced maverick director like Spike Lee I was expecting far more and in the end felt that what was delivered added little to this movie subgenre. For a start I did not like the pacing of the film, starting off with mastermind Clive Owens raison detre piece to camera, unnecessarily repeated at the conclusion, then finding the narrative peppered with confusing, not to say unrealseeming witness interviews, then finding yourself jumped into scenes you sense had begun earlier. Of course the camera work is fluid throughout, constantly on the move and incorporating handcamera shots aplenty, but director Lee fails to deliver thrills or suspense, falling down fundamentally by not making anything of the key protagonists in the film. Denzel Washington is weighed down with the clothes and badass jive talk of a Shaft movie thirty  five years earlier he even has that noone understands him but his woman thing going on, replete with his hot girlfriend, baiting her with some downright crude and inappropriate dirtytalk and his mild In The Heat Of The Night riff with Willem Defoe in almost a bitpart raises barely a ripple. Clive Owens plays his character with a resolutely English accent even as we are given to believe the gang is Arabbased, also hindered by having to play 90 of the film with a mask over his face. Jodie Foster delivers another of her patented tightlipped, ice maiden, subClarice Starling turns as a well connected financial bountyhunter, if you will, to little effect. Overall it is a real mishmash of a film, with a light but obvious twist at the end, in fact the title gives it away from the start, spoiler fans. Worst scene of many is undoubtedly Washingtons witnessinterview, unbelievably, with an 8 year old streetkid, although Owens dialogue with the same child minutes earlier runs it close in the embarrassment stakes.

Unfortunately, the pacing is painfully slow and the film takes an age to get going, before reaching fairly predictable places. The action is just about passable, with the final fight pretty cool, and the earlier one about OK. The earlier one is also marred by overspeedy camerawork, making for less coherency. There are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue but the film still drags badly. The characters are neither well fleshed out nor well acted and the setting and general color scheme is drab and boring. The film is not completely terrible and has some points of interest, perhaps judicious use of the fast forward button could improve it.

I will give credit to Denzel Washington, he played his part extremely well with a full grasp of his human side and not just the typical superdetective with all the answers. Clive Owen also did quite well with his duality part as evil genius and criminal mastermind both not the same in retrospect. Overall though, each person individually created a great subsection.

The movie starts off with Clive Owens character telling us what a criminal mastermind he is, and how he planned the perfect bank robbery, something he frequently reminds us of later. Oh yeah, he also tells us he is in a prison cell, although that turns out to be a dumb metaphor. Any idiot knows that the best bank robbery is one where a minimum number of things could potentially go wrong, and you are long gone before the police show up. But Clive Owens scheme requires hanging around the bank for hours  for no reason but to stalk around and look scary as far as I can tell. He also has to control hostages, negotiate with cops, and most fantastically of all, perform a ThisOldHouse job on the banks stockroom and hide out there for a week I hope he brought enough food, and a bucket to pee in and then sneak out again. Yeah, that sure sounds like the perfect crime to me, Clive! This plan has so many moving parts that the only reason it did not fall apart was the screenwriter said so.And then there are the many unexplained details Why were the cops so convinced that the crooks had accomplices among the hostages? Who the hell is Jodie Fosters character, and why is she so important that she has the mayor at her beck and call and she does not have to tell Denzel Washington her agenda because it is above his pay scale? How dumb are these cops that they cannot figure out one guy speaking in a foreign language for hours is not the sound of a criminal gang planning a robbery? How did the robbers slip away, and why did Clive Owen stick around for a week? How did they find out about the bank chairmans past, and the number and contents of his safe deposit box? Why the hell would Clive Owen let in Jodie Foster or the cops? Since when do they make toy AK47s that look real up close? How the hell do you bug a pizza box, anyway? How did Clive Owen manage to sneak out of a secure area of the bank during working hours, undetected? Did this dispassionate criminal really feel bonded enough to this cop Denzel to slip him a diamond?None of these questions are ever answered. There are films that achieve depth by leaving you to wonder about events that happen offscreen, but I never felt that way about Inside Man. It felt like the scenes that explained these things were cut from the movie, or these questions never had any answers in the first place, and that is weak. Particularly annoying is Jodie Fosters character, who will not disclose what she does, but never seems to tire of reminding us how important she is.

Now count how many of them were in which he played a copdetectivebody guard, whatever. Clive Owen, hmmmmmm, this guy needs a better role on his plate soon. His best performance was I think in Beyond Borders. Other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well. His tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in Sin City. Surely this guy knows acting, what he does not know is better way of choosing roles. He is in desperate need of a better agent. Jodie Foster was brilliant in the movie, if you are watching her for the first time in your life. She has done better. She has had better roles. It so happens in Hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as Jody Foster did in this movie. Plot Plot was not confusing, in fact, I could think of such a plot, in fact the whole movie, while taking a dump after a nice big Chinese dinner.

How did the bank robbers find out his secret? How did they know to zero in on this very safety deposit box 232? Ace detective Denzel Washington also discovers bank records show SD Boxes Nos 231 and 233, but no 232. Curious. He meticulously found time somehow to do an exhausting search of bank records to unearth this one curious fact. All the while dealing with a red hot hostage situation and bank robbers threatening to start executing them momentarily. Wow! Talk about super powers for a detective.The bank robbers leave behind millions of dollars in loose currency in the vault they have opened. They take only the contents of SD Box 232, ostensibly for the purpose of blackmailing the bank president. This defies any rational attempt at a logical explanation for what the film depicts as a criminal mastermind, or for his henchmen with lesser brains.Jodie Foster, using her political connections with the Mayor of NYC, gains permission to enter the bank which is under the control of the bank robbers while holding many hostages. She offers the chief bank robber a deal to buy back the documents he now has in hand, but he as not interested. So what is his point if any?.My wife was offended by the arrogance of all the players, Christopher Plummer Bank President, Denzel Washington ace detective, and Jodie Foster, crack trouble shooter for highpowered problems.The last Jodie Foster movie I saw, Flight Plan, was also riddled with holes that made no sense at all. I thought I liked Jodie Foster, but I will probably avoid her future films.Now my problem is that I can rarely persuade my wife to go to the movies. I cannot disagree with her on this one ... A WASTE OF MONEY, AND A WASTE OF TIME. Be forewarned. A well crafted film, fine actors, lousy script writing.","label":0},{"index":1875,"txt":"I have never seen any of Spike Lees prior films, as their trailers never caught my interest. I have seen, and admire Denzel Washington, and Jodie Fosters work, and have several of their DVDs. I was, however, entirely disappointed with this movie. If this film is any indication of Spike Lees ability as a director, my advice would be to get a job, and stop wasting the time and talent of others. I wonder if some of the other IMDb commentators watched the same movie that I would seen. I can only assume, from their sappy lovelorn reviews, that their adoration of Spike Lee has blinded them to the banality of this piece of work. I only paid 2.50, in a Second Run theater, and still felt I would wasted my money.The IMDb Trivia page says it all....... Shot in 39 days  How can you expect to shoot a big budget Blockbuster, as the media hype promised, in such a short time? No wonder there was such a weak performance by all. Ron Howard was first going to direct the film...  He may have done this project some justice, given more time to do so, of course. Though the writing was atrocious, the premise had some merits. OK! maybe not. I am sorry! This film was so rife with pitiful clich\u00e9s, implausible scenes, and lousy characterizations, that maybe even he could not have made much of it. Hey Ron! Be sure to thank Russell...Good call!  Jodie Foster filmed her part in three weeks.  And it showed! Her portrayal of a Fixer, who makes peoples problems go away, was as unbelievable as the script she was given. Did she even want to be there?Other Peeves  How many bank robbers would bother to come to the door, and inform a uniformed police officer that they were inside robbing the bank, and he would better keep away...or else?  When Detective Frazier, Denzel Washington, comes into the bank to verify there are no corpses yet, how many bank robbers, without a gun, would have led a cop, much less let a cop back out to the front door, allowing the police officer to walk behind him?  Det. Frazier later claimed, to have given the robber every reason to shoot me. Why, then, in their brief struggle, did not he even try to expose the robbers face? That may have gotten the response he was looking for...a robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification. And why did it take Steve, Stevie, SteveO, the robbers accomplice, so long to come and help out?  I understand that these were not your typical bank robbers. They had a different agenda, and did not want anyone harmed. But the cops had no reason to think that they would not. To them it was a desperate situation. Why then, when two of the bad guys stepped outside to pick up the pizzas?, were they not taken down. first of all, how many robbers would have came outside without using a hostage as a shield? Is this Spike Lees version of NY City, or SNLs?. Taking them down would have reduced the bad guys numbers, screwed up their plans, and the remaining robbers would more probably have given up. If not, there at least would be fewer bad guys inside. Give SWAT something to do, or send them home! What police department in this country, would have allowed Madeline White, Jodie Foster, to just waltz right into the bank, and discuss a matter with the robbers, that she would not disclose to them first? She had no authority, no governmental credentials; and besides, this was after all, already a hostage situation...add one more? Why would not the Bank CEO, Christopher Plummer, just have destroyed the incriminating documents a long time ago? Screw sentimentality! The diamonds, he could have sold. Who was that schmuck, the character, not the actor, with the Jersey accent, that, conveniently, volunteered, and said he knew the recording was 100 Albanian, but yet he himself could not speak it.....SIR! PUT YOUR HAND DOWN! And his Exwife! What a schlump she was!!! Both were totally unbelievable.  When interrogating suspects, why did Det. Frazier, continually harass the individuals who were obviously not a part of the heist?, i.e.  telling the elderly woman she could go, and then she could not, then could; then could not? Give me a break!  Who, after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages put on jump suites, could not deduce their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the hostages?  Near the end of the movie, a false wall was shown to have been built in the supply room, behind which Clive Owens hid out for a week....where did the materials come from? the drywall  studs. It was also to be assumed that they cut into the sewer, so he could relieve himself. The bank employees had not complained about the smell, all week long? Hello! After such a debacle; since the documents had fallen into the robbers hands, what kind of references was Ms. White expecting to get from the bank CEO, seeing that he was now to be a target for blackmail, due to her failure? And last, but certainly not least, What is with the Electric Glide that Denzel did? HOW STUPID! Was that supposed to indicate his resolve to bring these guys to justice? He looked, rather, like a man who hopped a ride on a shopping cart, while trying to prevent a bowel movement! CheeeeZheeee!!!! Other than the mediocre plot; lousy script; bad acting; and overall pitiful directing......yada, yada, yada. Hopefully this will give enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or not!.","label":0},{"index":1876,"txt":"I have seen most of Ryuhei Kitamuras work and I have come to the conclusion that he has a knack for action. Scenes are kinetic and fast often combining elements of martial arts, gun fights and samurai fights with camera work that effectively captures the on screen carnage. With Versus and Aragami Kitamura demonstrated that creativity and showed that he his more than capable of working with a low budget. So what happened in Alive ? To be more blunt, the answer would be  nothing. Nothing happened in Alive it was a two hours plus movie with little to no action and little to no characters and plot.Adapted from a comic book by Tsutomu Takahashi Alive is an examination of the life of one Tenshu Yashiro played by Hideo Sasaki a death row convict who survives his execution. He is then given a choice of either to repeat the execution or to subject himself in a bizarre series of experiments. He chooses the latter and soon after that is placed in a room along with a rapist and later with a girl infected with a strange parasite that in exchange for it is hosts humanity grants supernatural powers. Naturaly at some point that parasite moves into Yashiro, the bad thing is that does not happen very soon. Similar to Aragami, Alive sets it is first half in establishing the basic exposition. Characters are introduced, their motivations are set and their relations between each other are uncovered. The whole thing even takes place in just one set. The first major problem of that comparison is that while Aragami was just a 70 minute movie, Alive drags on for more than two hours thus making the first part over one hour long. That length could have been justified had the characters been made a bit more interesting but alas that is not the case. Dialogue is dry, monotonous, delivered without any sense of emotion or depth, characters themselves are not much interesting. There were some small attempts at making Alive a bit more moral ambiguous but in the end it all came down to the classic  evil government people against, superpowered protagonist, whom yes you guessed it, saves the girl in the end. Like I previously said the entire film practically takes place at just one set, and after two hours that does get boring, even worse the set design itself was not even interesting to begin with, and does not do much to improve on other aspects of the film.Now, after that first part is over, one might think that Kitamura would at least make some entertaining action scenes to make up for the boring beginning. Sadly that is not the case. The two only fights are actually rehashes of similar fights from Hollywood movies, complete with bullet time effects and psychic powers. They are just not interesting or fun, Kitamuras creativity from Versus is gone, the small set even limits his often very impressive camerawork and it all boils down into generic and expectable fights, a shame really.Evidently Aragami was better on all accounts and Kitamura had learned something from Alive. So it was not at least a total loss watching this movie. If only to understand the errors made, how to fix them and create a better more entertaining movie.","label":0},{"index":1877,"txt":"It is a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie. Besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments, what is so difficult about capturing the robbers? Just eliminate the bank workers, see who was at the bankfrom all the cameras footage anglesprior to the robbers entry and you have those extra 4 remaining robbers among the hostages. Where is the suspense every body is talking about? It was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door... seen it many times. At least Mr. Spike Lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting. The Movie is not worth it. Pronto!","label":0},{"index":1878,"txt":"It seems to me that Stephen Kings Bachman penname was a way for him to put out some of the grimmer, rawer, more meanspirited stuff that he wanted to write without contaminating his brand name. If you look back at the Bachman Books Running Man, The Long Walk, Roadwork, Thinner you notice they have a sealedin feeling of airlessness and hopelessness about them that is distinct from mainstream King. I realize that we are talking about the guy whose first novel featured a humiliated, bloodcovered, emotionally crippled teenage girl slaughtering everyone at her high school prom...but mainstream King always at have characters and plot elements that leaven the grimness of the proceedings a bit, and mostly have endings that offer at least a glimpse of hope and human feeling. Bachman books are just plain mean and always end badly. BTW, Pet Semetary could have easily been a Bachman book if King had not revealed the alias by then. And The Dark Half seems to be at least partially about his Bachman persona.Thinner was the last Bachman book, and man, with its themes of class warfare, revenge, and death by starvation, it is nasty. So it should be no surprise that the movie follows suit. What is a surprise is that the adaptation seems to be filmed at a TV Movie Of the Week level of talent instead of something worthy of a theatrical release. These days, something like this would probably go directly to DVD or cable. The makeup work and the striking motif starving to death in the midst of plenty, a metaphor for the overfed, undernourished American middle class if there ever was one is all that keeps you watching this misfire. What went wrong? My first thought is that the director was going for the nasty Bachman vibe, but he also somehow sucked all the interest out of the movie with poor casting choices  the actors here with the exception of Joe Monetegna simply cannot carry the movie. And then he squished the warmth and life out of the rest of the movie with awkward pacing and scene structure. Plus he could not leave the plot alone, and his changes do not really help. The script and dialog ought to work, but mostly the movie just lies there. Everything is muffled, dull, airless, and no fun to watch...with the vivid exception of the spectacle of the main character getting....thinner, and thinner, and thinner. As other have pointed out, Thinner is by no means the worst King movie ever made or even the second worst. And it does have a dreadful, compelling fascination owing to the theme and the careful makeup work. But first time viewers should approach this one with lowered expectations.","label":0},{"index":1879,"txt":"This movie was absolutely terrible. I cannot believe I paid to see it in the theatre.

Except for the fairly good makeup effects, there is really not much to it. There are obvious problems; for example, after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size, the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days... and once he is deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long time.In any case, the movie has far worse problems than thatthe cinematography is decidedly lowbudgetTVshow quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around. Robert John Burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling Charlton Heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch... the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both even worse.The only reason why I am giving this movie as high as I am is that once the movie enters its last 13 or so and Joe Mantegnas character takes over, the movie develops a fun, campy cheesefest slaughterhouse feel, and the gangsters crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch. The ending, if predictable, is also nicely mean.

And fer crying out loud, can someone please stop hiring Joseph Mantegna for every Italian Mafioso role there ever is? And while we are at it, does every Mafioso have to have a pasta cooking Italian mother? The only good acting job done here is under 10 pounds of makeup, Michael Constantine as the Gypsy elder.

Burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of a gypsy and is cursed by her father Constantine from TVs Room 222 to several pounds a day. Like I said, it starts out good, but why involve the mobster Mantegna? Why fire automatic weapons so much? Why turn it into something so heavily dependent on FX? I thought it would have been much more effective if it focused more on the subtle ramifications of weight loss crazes, diseases, death, gypsy lore and such. But no, it is not to be. Remember, this is Stephen King we are talking about.And the ending... almost the same as the book, but a little too talky. In fact the whole movie talks too much, feeling it has to explain every plot turn to us.

If you have read the book, there are zero surprises, no changes, no altering of scenes or characters. This is a film made by King fans for King fans.For the rest of us, there is nothing terrible about the film, it is a gypsy curse horror, with its twist being the curse being something many people wish for, to become thinner.

I love how Carrie played out like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such. It was so good. But I noticed that both of the novels were nothing like the movies. The endings were very different then the movie versions. I assume from those two novels that all of his novels are changed greatly and the endings are always cheesy. I ending of Thinner is the worst. So Cheesy.

The father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3, with our main character, Billy the lawyer getting thinner and thinner by the day. Though the movie kept with the book, for the most part, and has your typical King ending, the acting was stilted and felt forced. We went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between, sort of like reading acts in a play. King himself made a cameo in the movie sort of like Dave Barry, which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that authors. Leave the acting to actors.

Horror movies are an acquired taste. Regular movies give an audience a hero to applaud as he strives to achieve a goal. In horror movies, audiences are invited to savor the demise of characters. In director Tom Hollands lowfat but tasteless revenge chiller Thinner, nobody wins and everybody deserves the bite that is put on them. Gluttonous New England attorney Billy Halleck Robert John Burke of Robocop 3 has a weight problem. Although he rocks the bathroom scales at 300 pounds, he appears happily married to a trim, delectable wife, Heidi Lucinda Jenney of G.I. Jane with a yeasty teenage daughter.Fat does not mean stupid here. Halleck displays his sagacity in court when he wins an acquittal verdict for sleazy Mafia chieftain Richie Ginelli Joe Mantegna of House of Games. Driving home from a victory feast, Billy hits an old gypsy woman crossing the street and kills her. A coverup occurs, and Hallecks friends get him out of the soup. The disgruntled gypsy father Taduz Lemke Michael Constantine of Skidoo retaliates with a curse on the corpulent lawyer and the two town officials that exonerated him. Suddenly, Halleck finds himself shedding pounds no matter how much chow he chomps. When he begs the vengeful Gypsy to lift the curse, the old man refuses. Desperately, Halleck resorts to Richie. While Halleck struggles with the gypsies to remove the hex, he learns that his loyal wife has turned his attentions to the towns hotshot doctor.Thinner qualifies as not only laughably inept horror flick, but the filmmakers also rely on stereotypes of men and women. Tom Holland, who directed Childs Play 1988, and scenarist Michael McDowell, have served up such a slipshod script that you cannot relish watching Billy get his just dessert and shrivel up. Thinner boasts few shocks and fewer surprises. The filmmakers may have regurgitated Kings novel, but they have filleted whatever sense of horror and humor it contained. Holland and McDowell introduce characters, such as the Mafioso, then inexplicably let them off the hook. One minor character shows up long enough to die and have a chickens head stuffed in his mouth.The stereotypical behavior of the characters may offend audiences, too. Thinner depicts women as oversexed vixens and men as swine. When Halleck sneaks home from a clinic, he finds his doctors sports car parked at his house. His suspicions ripen into jealousy and he cooks up a scheme to get the curse transferred to this wife. Even the premature ending lacks any satirical flavor. Oscarwinning special effects wizard Greg Cannom of Van Helsing and makeup artist Bob Laden do a fabulous job beefing up actor Robert John Burke to look obese. They succeed, too, in making him shrivel.Only diehard Stephen King fans will be able to stomach this misogynistic gooledyspook.","label":0},{"index":1892,"txt":"You will notice that the chemist, who appears in two scenes and gets to speak, is played by Stephen King.

Admittedly, I have never heard of any of them before, but still, I do not think I could walk into a talent agency and walk out with this many bad performers if I tried ONE actor, despite my best efforts, would turn out to have talent. So what is more likely  that Tom Holland rolled a dozen consecutive snakeeyes, or that he wrote a lousy script and then directed it poorly? That would also explain why actors are bad in direct proportion to their prominence in the script. The more direction an actor got, the worse he performed. You want me to bend over like a hunchback, talk from the back of my throat, show all my teeth, and look bored, all at the same time? Okay...This theory is confirmed by the fact that Holland undeniably managed to cowrite a lousy script. Several writers here have commented on the fact that Billy Halleck is not a likeable character, but that is a misleading way of putting it. He is not a knowable character. All we find out about him before the supernatural stuff starts happening is that he is fat, and that all he can think about is food. All I can think about is food, he tells us, helpfully.

He takes away any strength and conviction a man could have by having several boring women do him in. Number one bore is Joyce Hyser as the wife. I could not wait for him to drop her. Her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing through most of the movie. The other femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz, about the coldest person you would ever want to meet. Her looks did not warrant our leading man to go that ape over her and her acting was so obvious, only a fool could miss. Definitely a loser. Tembi Locke was pretty good, but slow on the uptake as to the slut seducing her own husband, again played as a guy who is a loser, by David DeLuise. Rounding out our cast of losers is Anthony Denison as a boss who has little to do but scowl at our hero. Stephen Jenkins as our hero, or should I say victim, was not that good. At first I thought he just a bad actor, but later I believed it. He never got the part off the ground and was repetitive throughout. Although, as a man, I became enraged when the two women got away with it. Men, beware of this channel that puts men down and women get away even with murder. LMN is the channel. Beware.

I still believe he has disgraced the male species and should be horse whipped.

The film looks beautiful, with each scene designed as a period painting, like a tableaux vivant. And I expected much talking, as that is Rohmers style. But maybe Rohmer was restrained by basing the screenplay on a real womans writings is why this mostly felt like a docudrama version of The Scarlet Pimpernel.As awful as the excesses of Robespierre et al, how about some recognition that the French aristocrats were spoiled brats? I kept humming to myself Marat, we are poorand the poor stay poor; you could also pick a tune from Les Miz.I was not all that sympathetic as the central figure has to go back and forth between her city home and country manor to stay ahead of the Revolution. At one point her maid claims the pantry is bare but sure manages to lay out a fine repast. I simply did not understand her, an English sympathizer who alternately rejects and defends her former lover and patron as he and the Revolution keep shifting political focus; I think I was supposed to sympathize with her consistency more than their political machinations, like a character out of The Scarlet Pimpernel. Hey, the only reason she did not go back home was her disgrace after an affair and child with the Prince of Wales or somebody. Usually in a revolutionary period there is some groundswell of change going on in relations between men and women, but I saw none here. I once went to a Herbert Marcuse lecture that concluded with a lengthy Q  A; the last question, from an audience member far older than the rest of us acolytes, heck she had gray hair, was Why are revolutionaries so grim? She was hooted at and Marcuse did not deign to respond to it seriously  but it is the only thing of substance I remember from the whole evening. Rohmer demonstrates that counterrevolutionaries are also grim and didactic.originally written 8112002","label":0},{"index":1900,"txt":"There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer actress Nichole Hiltz.

Oh, but not by conventional means. She plans a total guerrilla war and recruits bad girl Nichole Hiltz as her weapon of choice. She wants Nichole as Tuesday to get close to her ex the handsome but dull Stephan Jenkins, who should stick to music to embarrass him and ruin his life. David DeLuise is good in his few brief moments, and former Crime Story star Anthony Dennison is given virtually nothing to do but scowl. Hiltz on the other hand comes off at various times as sexy and playful, then evil and devious. She also handles vulnerable and maybe a bit psychotic well.

From the setting which was quite obviously and very clear to anyone who has visited London for even 1 day will agree...was not London. To the much unexplained way how Snipes character managed to escape the country back to the US without a single problem. Then he convinces the girl and grandmother to visit him in America, how on earth did Grandma agree to that...he is an assassin! Well that is the ending how about during the film, well unfortunately that did not fare much better. We have British cops driving an amazing range of cars, I am sure it was an eighties Vauxhall Belmont which chased the taxi after the assignation, but a modern Subaru Imprezza escorting the prison van in a few scenes prior. SO19 or whoever the gun toting arm of the Met they were trying to portray was happily running around the streets with their guns out chasing after Snipes along with the CIA. There were children walking around, but the police were still stating they had a clear shot to shoot him, does this happen in London? No it does not, I live there. We also have the very implausible travel from central London to the airport let us say Heathrow for arguments sake within 5 minutes of receiving a call. We also have terrible American accents, a young girl who is posher than the Queen, but lives in Elephant  Castle. What does it say for British police when helicopters and a number of officers at Snipes location cannot find Snipes and he manages to evade capture by hiding behind some stairs? The train station was obviously not even on UK soil and the fight scene sound effects were terrible. The plot was also extremely poor, boring and been written and filmed a lot better a thousand times before. But there were a few notable actors cast in this film, what were they thinking and please do not let that sway you to watch this film! This film did not seem to know what it wanted to be, if you are going to concentrate on the dramatic aspects from the aftermath of an assignation then you need a strong rigid plot with plausible scenery and setting, this is something the viewer has time to take in and appreciate and if you do it wrong then you notice it.

I feared that the shaky, blurry, pseudodocumentary, unconsidered directing and editing style first brought to my attention by the Paul Greengrassdirected Bloody Sunday might propagate to other films.

In my opinion, these films are made really bad by these motionsicknessinducing methods, which mistake blurry swipes for actionenhancement.

I lost my brother to meth and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because it glamorizes the drug. The movie makes it look cool to use the drug but I was happy at the end when the guy almost made it across the state line. I also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape do not want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day. The movie is just wrong in all directions. I would suggest The Basketball Diaries if I was going to suggest a movie about drugs.","label":0},{"index":1928,"txt":"The week before I saw Iowa, I saw Art School Confidential, in which a pretentious student makes a film and cannot decide whether he wants it to be art or violent exploitation. Iowa could be the film that he made. I can see elements of much better movies in Iowa  Spun and Natural Born Killers. However, in addition to artiness, both those movies had good character development and coherent story lines. Iowa. This movie stumbles to a preposterous end. I have to admit that it had consistency. This movie is bad from beginning to end and not particularly worse or better in any part. The actors all did what they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves better. She demonstrates that she is very talented, very funny, and very sexy. But why does she have to demonstrate it in this turd ball.","label":0},{"index":1929,"txt":"Well, I do not think the picture is as bad as most of the reviews make it out to be. . . but there is no denying that it is got problems.Mostly, the problems are in the script. There is a plot  but not much story, and certainly not one that anybody could call plausible; it trots out any number of selfconsciously strange andor stereotypical characters, lines, moments, whathaveyou and, by the end, it just has not added up to much in this department.Sorry, but I could not care less about whatever social ill Farnsworth might be trying to address; there will always be a sector of the population willing to do just about anything to shred their brains, even if it requires running around corn fields trying to steal ammonia, or whatever it is those morons do. So, as a film, you will not find me calling Iowa important. But, at a stylistic level, the picture is more than interesting and some of Farnsworths choices in depicting a methheads wiggedout state are beautiful, hilarious, disturbing and  yes, I am going to say it  inspired.The acting is uneven, but that just may be a casualty of the aforepraised stylistic reaching. Look, Rosanna Arquette is a fine actress  but she is not very good here, so a discriminating audience member does have to ask, What happened? It is weird that Diane Foster manages a simplicity and grace that so few of the other actors can come anywhere near. For example, I might seriously consider whatever explanation Farnsworth could provide for Michael T. Weisss overthetop turn as a probation officer, but I doubt I would ever buy it; It Just Does not Work. Then again, it is the most alive and in the moment that I have seen John Savage appear in years. So go figure.This is the sort of work that tantalizes, but does not promise  and that is okay; neither Farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make movies. So, whether or not Farnsworth has another film in him remains to be seen, but if he does, it seems pretty likely that it will not be bland pap. In an age when people are planning their lives around the latest installment of American Idol, perhaps we could allow, not scorn, Farnsworths legitimate and undeniably flawed film. What is more, perhaps we could welcome, not berate, his energetic and sometimes blessedly idiosyncratic imagination.","label":0},{"index":1930,"txt":"Iowa wants to be Requiem for a Dream for Midwest meth, but it comes across as a hard R rated Reefer Madness. Yes, drugs are bad, and meth is horribly pernicious, as an addiction and how it destroys people, families and communities. But these characters who are either dumb or ridiculous and the eyerolling plot will not teach that lesson to anyone. While writerdirectorstar Matt Farnsworth has some charisma on screen, his partner Diane Foster plays a wincibly silly wideeyed innocent corrupted by drugsas was already satirized by Susan Sarandon in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I really felt sorry for her for all the totally unnecessary nudity she was put through. It was not until the end of the film that I realized I was supposed to think these two were recent highschool graduates to explain some of their naivet\u00e9, as we are bombarded by their school photos, but if so, they even looked older than the folks on The O.C.. While they have good chemistry on screen, they are a pale imitation of a Badlandstype couple. The guest stars are badly used. Michael T. Weiss, who was so good in TVs The Pretender, is completely ludicrous as a corrupt parole officer and his brutal violence is just plain crazy, as his character pretty much ruins any social significance for the film. Rosanna Arquette has to be even sleazier than she rolled around for David Cronenberg as a very low rent Livia Soprano. John Savage even has to mouth the old baby boomer excuses about I did pot but this is worse. A Goth chick shows up, with the odd explanation that she is a stripper from Des Moines. The obligatory Latino drug dealer appears  in Iowa? With a limited budget, the interior view of meth use is portrayed quite vividly, with quite scary hallucinations. We certainly see them go crazy. While the Iowa locations are used very well including an amusing scene of a propane gas robbery, the accents and church references are confusingly Southern Baptist. Guns seem to be used by law abiding and law breaking citizens here more than in any innercity drugdealing movie.The songs of Iowas best known bard Greg Brown are used throughout, but oddly are not listed in the credits. I hope they were used with permission.I caught this at its commercial run in NYC because I missed it at the Tribeca Film Festival where it got considerable and inexplicable buzz.","label":0},{"index":1931,"txt":"The oftenreliable Leonard Maltin says this is a delightful romance and that Sanders is superb.

The storyline itself, an autobiography with Sanders as a suave jewel thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels, is entertaining enough, but it has the same kind of hollow historical Hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as Marie Antoinette, and certainly the deplorable Forever Amber which screams for a classy remake. Though, in his defense, Sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character, it is all for naught. I am an unabashed Douglas Sirk fan, but this is 1946, and it is one of Sirks earliest American efforts, lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid, breastheaving potboilers. Sirk is just getting his feet wet here, and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with Magnificent Obsession, and hit his stride, bombarding us with such estrogenfests as All That Heaven Allows, Written on the Wind, and Imitation of Life.

Is it the worst Western ever? No, I would not say that. But the last great American Western, a phrase I saw applied to it more than once? Not even close.A movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clich\u00e9d that I have ever seen. The movie can be measured in groaners per minute; as in, how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life? There is so many instances of this that it is distracting. Cheesy lines come at you in waves; predictable, unoriginal, and often. If bad dialogue does not bother you, then how about bad gunfights? Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that is completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously. It is okay if there is a comic edge to such gunfighting, such as in Silverado, but in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good Westerns. The final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score, but by then, I was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving.Other than those flaws, I can say the visuals are stunning  the movies well shot and the settings all look great. The acting is passable, especially considering what the actors were given to work with. However, if you are looking for the last great American Western, do yourself a favor  go rent Unforgiven instead.3 out of 10","label":0},{"index":1938,"txt":"The fact that I did not like the music is a very personal opinion, the historical innacuracies are not.

Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, even if he never set foot on the Achile Lauro. Ben Laden never set foot on the planes that hit the WTC, did he? possible spoilers The movie almost excuses the terrorists actions and reactions because of horrors they might have lived, always accentuating and exaggerating how much the Israelis have done to hurt them.

The movie uses quite horrid!!! images from the Sabra and Chatila horror, and nothing is said, understating the general belief that it was Israel who was responsible, without ever mentioning that it was a Syrianles Lebanese army who conducted the massacre.The acting was generally very bad, but I guess that is what can be expected from opera singers?On another note I am shocked at how a person can excuse terrorists killing a hostage because the hostage tried to stir the 400 innocent hostages against the armed terrorists, and add that the person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of zionism.

Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga, whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenks Mall. The kids must move around town on buses, and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly, but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids. Hey Arnold, the TV cartoon is usually very entertaining, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold the movie, is about five times more sedated, and a good way to put anyone, including kiddies to sleep.

Roses Mma Makutsi is an annoying motormouthed bitch.The result is almost unwatchable. The principal cast is redeemed only by the presence of Lucian Msamati, who turns in a decent performance as Mr JLB Matekoni. Hes comes off smarter and more intense than in the books, but I find myself unable to blame Msamati for this  he is a shining light in an ocean of suckage. The contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly laid at the feet of whichever committee of butchers wrote the script.To me, McCall Smiths writing has always been highly entertaining yet notoriously bad. He refuses to be edited. As a result, his books contain experiments in grammar that border on the scientific, and characters that change name midsentence. It is therefore something of an achievement that the writing team on this project actually made it worse.The dialogue is now largely Anglicised. Characters speak of opening up and sensitivity to needs. Mma Ramotswe and Mr JLB Matekoni flirt openly. Mma Makutsi moans about not having a computer, but given her constantly restyled hair, makeup and jewellery, I am surprised she does not have a MacBook in her handbag along with her Visa card.So what are we left with here? It is difficult to be upset with this crappy adaptation because honestly, most of the things I like about the original books are apocryphal anyway. McCall Smith paints a fictional Botswana populated with cute, nonthreatening black people who are full of amusing and palatable wisdomnuggets. It reads well despite linguistic travesty, but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wishes black people were. It just is not true.Given that, it is hardly surprising that this show sucks as much as it does. It remains to be seen whether European and American audiences will even notice, however.","label":0},{"index":1962,"txt":"I had somewhat high hopes for this since I like Tim Roth. I was not pleased with this film. I liked the Ang Lee The Hulk a few years back so I figured this would have more of a bang to it. First I was very disappointed with John Hurts performance here. He looks as if his eyebrows were reshaped for this. His performance was not convincing. He was not as good as one would expect. Tim Roth is cool as always here. The Gama thing did not really stick to the original story line I do not think. I guess the best part of the film was the end. It had some cool action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This one is not as long but it got a bit boring at times. I remember some time ago when Walmart had this movie really cheap for sale and I always wondered why?. Now I know. I was hoping to to get blown away, but I was not.","label":0},{"index":1963,"txt":"This reboot is like a processed McDonalds meal compared to Ang Lees very good but very underrated 2003 The Incredible Hulk.Ang Lees The Hulk is a comic book movie for the thinking person. The Hulk takes some time to appear about 40 minutes, but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonists core. He does his best to avoid losing control, but as he admits, when he does give in to his rage, he likes it.Now compare this to Edward Nortons turn, where there is no display of conflict in his personality, and he turns into the Hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute not 183, not 197, but exactly 200. To this reviewer, this felt akin to the introduction of midichlorians in The Phantom Menace, which tell how strong the force is with one, as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test. In the 2008 movie, all Ed Nortons Bruce Banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200, as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist. And for the record, it is extremely difficult to get ones pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run, especially for a physically fit person.Emotions drive Eric Banas Hulk. He has repressed memories of his mothers death and his fathers role in his early life. On the surface he is calm, but there underneath there is significant anger, enough rage to fuel the Hulk when it is unleashed. But the Hulk never kills intentionally, even his attackers. Mostly, he just wants to get away or close to Betty Ross Jennifer Connelly. He incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene, saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collision.In the 2003 movie, the visual effects are there, but as necessary. The action scenes and there are plenty of them are necessary to the plot, unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of action.In his quest to turn it into a fugitive story, Ed Norton loses focus on how Bruce Banner feels about the Hulk. To him, the Hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment went awry. And Louis Leterrier, the director picking up on Ed Nortons cue, fails to add any emotional dimension to the BannerHulk relationship. The story can be summed up as Banner is pursued and Hulk kicks butt, Banner is pursed and Hulk kick butt. Repeat as necessary.The only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version. However, even as I am a fan of the comics, I would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboys dream but has heart over the comicsloyal but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any day.Perhaps Ang Lee should have read more comics. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comicbook roots and has heart.","label":0},{"index":1964,"txt":"Somebody owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually, a lot of people do. And I will start. I was never interested in the Ang Lee film Hulk, because of the near unanimous bad reviews. Even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it. I finally decided to watch it yesterday on USA network and, wow....SPOILERS FOR ANG LEES HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK Was it boring! I almost did not make it through Ang Lees Hulk. Eric Bana was expressionless, Nick Nolte was horrible, Sam Elliott was unlikeable and that is no fun, he is usually a cool character. In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his nondescript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics  and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk was meant to facially resemble Bruce Banner in his nonangry state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle I was ready to concede Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever.But then something happened. About 34 of the way through this tedious movie, there was a genuinely exciting and  dare I say it  reasonably convincing  extended action scene that starts with Hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base, fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert, then riding an F22 Raptor into the stratosphere, only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say, the CGI was quite good. That is not to say that the Hulk was totally convincing. But it did not require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of nonsuperhero action movies. And that is quite a feat.Of course, the ending got really stupid with Bruce Banners father turning into some sort of shapeshifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of Iron Mans brief heroics to shame. And overall, apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really did seem like the CGI in Hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment. It was certainly better than I expected.OK, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what... It is boring too! It has just a few appearances by the Hulk and heres the thing  the CGI in this movie is horrible. Maybe the Hulk in Ang Lees version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others  but it had its convincing moments also. The Incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous. It had skin tone and muscle tone that did not even look like a living creature, just some sort of computergenerated texture. It was really preposterous. The lighting, environment and facial effects did not look 5 years newer than Ang Lees, they looked 10 years older. And there really is no excuse for that. We truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director, actor or cinematographer ever could.Worse, the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from Ang Lees failure. All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is practically emotionless. The general is so relentlessly, implausibly onedimensional that he seems faker than the Hulk. The love interest is unconvincing I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, though both are quite easy on the eyes. Tim Blake Nelson overacts almost as much as Nick Nolte, even though he is only in the movie for a few minutes. The Hulk really does not do much in this movie, certainly not any more than in Ang Lees version. The Incredible Hulk was slightly more fastpaced, but since nothing really happened anyway that is not worth much. Oh yeah, the villain is every bit as phony looking as the Hulk. He is actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster. This is how I can definitively say Ang Lees version was better if I ever have the chance to see Ang Lees version again, I might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences, or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more more likely I would just fast forward to the good parts. But there is absolutely not a single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing once, let alone twice. It is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies. The cartoonish CGI is an insult to the audience  at least in Ang Lees version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic except for the giant poodle, of course.It is absolutely mindboggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lees Hulk by making almost exactly the same movie. It is to Edward Nortons credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film.","label":0},{"index":1965,"txt":"Revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films since, in fact, most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events. Unfortunately, what this film lacks in drama is compensated for by an overabundance of boredom. One cares not who wins, loses, dies or livesjust end it as soon as possible. This is due in large measure to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology. Scenes of Paris and the French countryside have a cardboard quality about them. They might better be done on a bare stage and left that way. One cannot expect the amazing effects of The House of the Flying Daggers or The Golden Compass, but , after all, this is a 2002 digitally mastered production. Characters seem to enter a scene for the sake of entering a scene, so much so that one loses count of the number of times character enter and leave rooms.

Who REALLY did the writing for this last installment of the Godfather saga? Probably the same staff who does As the World Turns. This flick does not deserve the title Godfather at all. Let us call this one The Cosas of Our Nostras or All My Capos. As someone who is encountered a number of Mafia people in my business life, I can say without exception, that I have never met any mobster as inwardlyconflicted and contemplative as Michael Corleone. Let us face it, these guys are in the Mafia solely because they are greedy, nothing more. In this film, Don Corleone spends lots of time pondering his past deeds and his bleak future, perhaps even the Afterlife, then recovers remarkably fast in order to pull off some fantastic business deal or order the death of this one or that one like the big time operator he is, deep down. Then, there is his failed marriage. After the breakup scenes in G2, we may hope that Michael  Kay will reunite as man and wife, but here they seem to just become very good, platonic friends who can laugh  cry  share intimate thoughts about their lives. It is as if the screenwriters try to make Michael into a woman. It is bizarre behavior for two people who shared the passion of the marriage bed for 9 years. There is some miscasting here and there, or perhaps they are sins of authorship. Poor, oldcountrybeautiful Sophia Coppola is saddled with a hopeless role, with too many short lines in the film that do not fit what a young woman would say in casual conversations  was given remarks rather than lines to emote. Her passionate lovemaking scene with Andy Garcia looks like something from a bad teen sex comedy as they chew their openmouthed kisses and fondle each others backsides on the kitchen drainboard like marionettes...scullery sex was brought off wonderfully by Glenn Close and Michael Douglas, but it is just laughable here. Then, there is Andys character, Vinnie Mancini, who is also given a difficult  thankless role to play. He is expected, I guess, to be the new, new Don Corleone, but he is almost handed the job on a silver platter and has to do little to strengthen his position, unlike Michaels simultaneous hits on all 5 Families in G1. This handmedown process may be an authentic way of transferring power in a Mafia Family, but why is so much made of this boring routine? Certainly, Don Vincent may earn the respect of his fellow gangsters someday, but there is little character revelations in the script to give us a portrait of this young man, sadly. Puzo did such a fine job of quickly  concisely developing Michaels character in G1. But, G3 has no economy in it is storytelling and we suffer through drawn out expositories until we just want to take a snooze. Thirdly, George Hamilton was also handed a thankless task, in taking over as family lawyer after Robt Duvall reportedly turned down a 3rd installment as Tom Hagen. George wisely underplayed his role, so it came off without damage to the actor. The development of Connie Corleones character is interesting, but it goes too far when she takes murderous matters into her own hands she could well end up sleeping with the Fredos, if this were the real world. But, it is not all bad. The assassination scene in the hotel penthouse is nifty! Also, they keep pulling me back in or words to that effect is a great line. And, we recover some oldcountry feel as we get to go back to Sicily, even if it is all done in 1989 and they have got modern cars  haircuts. The plot lines involving the corrupt hierarchy of the Catholic Church are pretty interesting, since it is based on some actual financial shenanigans at Banco Vaticani in the 1980s, but it is brought too far, again, with the toospectacular death scenes, etc. The Grand Opera scenes are very dramatic and well photographed. But, the death scene of Mary toward the end is an unbalanced attempt of emotionalmanipulation, at best. All screenwriters need to learn that we do not always need more and more death in order to bring a mafia movie to a successful conclusion. You feel sorry for Kay that her daughter is dead, she plays her grief so well, but Michaels reaction is hammy, hammy, hammy. Then, Michael dies sometime in the 21st Century, in Sicily, alone on a grand estate, of heartfailure...no grandson to play with before his demise, no wife to grieve for him. What SHOULD have happened in the last 12 of this movie is Michael being tracked down by someone like Rudy Guilliani, put on trial, all his dirty familys sleazy little enterprises and bloodthirsty indulgences brought into the light of day, Michael then convicted under RICO statutes and sent to Federal Prison for life...then he can keel over dead from heartfailure while mopping a floor IN LEAVENWORTH.

If you have read the Puzos books, or at least have watched very closely the two first movies specially the first one, you are going to agree with me.Compared with the Corleones saga presented by Puzos novel, the script of this film is, sometimes, even ridiculous. The characters and the relationships among them are distorted. The story ends up reaching nowhere, although it appears to go to some direction during the movie.It is understandable that different times should be expected for the Corleones saga in the 90s, and that we would not gonna find things the way they were before. But, in the other hand, I do not know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies, in contexts when they did not fit. Why this? It sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the original films qualities.What will never be understandable is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino joined together to make this. A man who directed pieces like Apocalypse Now and Godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies. So does Al Pacino, for being the actor he is. But Mario Puzo should not have written this. How come? He damaged all his previous work. What a shame, my friend. The Puzos novel The Last Don is a 90s story about the mob, and it is great.

Michael Corleone does not want this. But his estranged exwife, Kay, manages to convince him to let Anthony Corleone pursue music as he wishes. So he does.That seems like an odd way to start a review, as it is a minor plot point and has nothing really to do with the major action. Just bear with me here; you will see where I am going with this eventually. Now let me tell you about the major plot. It is about Michael Corleone wanting to quit crime for good he has largely abandoned all criminal elements in his family business. But then along comes Vincent Mancini, an illegitimate nephew, who is involved in a feud. So of course Michael must endure yet another brush with criminality and gun violence and all that good gangster stuff. Meanwhile, Vincent has a semiincestuous affair with Michaels daughter Mary. Oh, and Michael and Kay are trying to patch up all the horrid things that happened at the end of Part II.It is like a soap opera. One horrid, awful, 169minute soap opera. Gone is any sort of the sophistication, romance, and emotional relevance that made the first two movies hit home so hard. After a 16year break in the franchise, Francis Ford Coppola delivered a mess of sop and pretentiousness entirely incongruous with the first two films, once again proving his last great work was Apocalypse Now back in the 1970s.What is worse, The Godfather Part III is not even a logical followup of The Godfather Part II. Michael is a completely different person. He has not just gone to seed which might be legitimate, even if it would be no fun to watch. He is become a goodygoody that is trying to fix all the tragedy that made Part II such a devastating masterpiece. His confession to the priest was bad enough, but that little diabetes attack in the middle pushed it over to nauseating. He also gets back together with Kay! For heavens sakes, there is absolutely no way that should happen, as the 2nd movie made abundantly clear! She aborted his baby, and his Sicilian upbringing made him despise her for it. Did not Francis Ford Coppola even think of these things?And do not even get me started on Mary and Vincents affair! For a romance so forbidden, it was shockingly unengaging. Sofia Coppolas acting did nothing to help. She made the smartest move of her life when she switched from in front of the camera to behind it, because she was possibly THE worst actress I have ever seen in a Best Picture nominee. Every line she delivered was painfully memorized, and every time the drama rested on her acting abilities, all she elicited was inappropriate giggles. In the climactic sceneI will not go into detail, but you will know which scene I am talking about whenif you watch itshe looks at Michael and says, ......Daddy? I think I was meant to cry, but the line was delivered so poorly I burst out into long, loud laughter!Now we get to the climax, and now you will also realize why I took time to start the review with a description of Anthony Corleones musical ambitions. After 140 minutes of petty drama and irrelevant happenstances, Anthony Corleone returns... with an opera! So Michael, Kay, Mary, and Vincent go to see it, and for about 1015 minutes a couple killers walk around trying to assassinate Michael. About this climactic sequence, I must say one thing It was really good! But not because of the killersthey were pretty boring. I just really liked the opera. It had some great music and real great set pieces. And, from what little it showed us, it seemed that the story had echoes of the Corleone familys origin. I will bet it was one swell opera, and I will bet Michael Corleone was glad he let his son switch from law school to music.My biggest wish is this that Francis Ford Coppola had merely filmed Anthony Corleones opera for 169 minutes and ditched the rest of the soggy melodrama. Better yet, I wish he had not made The Godfather Part III at all. Part II gave us the perfect ending. This spin off was selfindulgent and unnecessary.P.S. This is not a gut reaction to the film. I watched all 3 Godfather films over a month ago though I was rewatching the first one. Not only does this mean that my expectations for Part III were not screwed in fact, I had set the bar rather low for it after what I heard, but it also means I have had a good time to think about all three films. While I was a bit disappointed with Part II at first, the more I thought about it, the better it seemed. But with Part III, it was bad to begin with, then got worse the more I thought about it. The sad thing is that many people will stop with Part I, but if they watch Part II as well, they will most likely go on to Part III.

The Godfather Part II shows that young mans acceptance of his new role, his desensitization of character, as well as his complete loss of all innocence as he dives deeper and deeper into a life of crime. The first two parts of this saga of this transformation of Michael Corleone make for one of the greatest tragedies in cinematic history.Then, along came The Godfather Part III. Michael Corleone is now the aging Don of the Corleone family. He shows remorse for his previous actions not through subtle behaviors, but by trying to use his powers for good and admitting all his wrongdoings and regrets to others. Very cliche and uncharacteristic of the complex character that is Michael Corleone. Michaels plans to use his powers for good are derailed by an ambitious young disciple and his enemies. Michaels daughter is eventually a casualty of the ongoing mob wars and her death predictably leads to Michael realizing that his entire life as Don has been worthless for he has failed in the one thing that was the reason for putting himself into the position he was in protecting his family.The Godfather Part II ends with Michael Corleone reaching the lowest of the lows having his own brother killed. Before Part III was made, the Godfather saga was an emotionally riveting tale of an innocent young mans journey into darkness with the unbelievably tragic end of Michael forgetting his roots and abandoning the one thing that has always mattered most to him and those around him family loyalty. Part III paints the picture of Michael as a man who is and always has been just a victim of circumstance. This greatly corrupts the meaning of the first two films.The Godfather Part III is a horrible mess of a film that never should have been made. The only solution to the problem that is this final installment of The Godfather movies is to pretend that it does not exist and that the saga actually ends with Michaels shockingly horrible act of having a member of his own family killed.","label":0},{"index":1979,"txt":"The danish movie Slim Slam Slum surprised me to be the worst movie i have seen to this date. I did not think that it was possible to top my list of bad bad bmovies but this one deserves the gold. It is not funny. It is bad acting, It is bad filmed and the storyline is bad. The only positive thing i can say about this movie is it has three girls in it. I truly believe this flick has the potential to knock of the other danish movie Stjerner uden hjerner as the badest danish film ever made! And that is truly something.

Was there ever a script for this goofy movie or did the director just accidentally press the recordbutton on his camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along? Is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what? My friends younger brother is in the 6.th grade and him and his classmates just did an amateurmovie for their schoolproject which outdid this geeky movie..

It is not a terrible episode, it is just hard to follow up The man that was death., All through the house, and Dig that cat, he is real gone.This episode is about a couple that has just been married Peggy Ammanda Plummer and Charles Stephen Shellen. In the first five minutes you find out that Charles only married Peggy for her money. The two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion. Charles soon finds out a secret of Peggys family...In my opinion you should watch this episode, but just do not expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season.","label":0},{"index":1984,"txt":"HORRID!!The special effects make the TV version of Tremors look real!No one in the cast can act.Kind of like the 62 Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea meets the cartoon ocean going electric eel cartoons.","label":0},{"index":1985,"txt":"This was one of the worst movies EVER!!!!!!!!

And I swear...I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for the eels! And there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced. How predictable! It was SO terrible that my mom, my sister, and I could not finish it, and when we DID finish it, it was about a year later! The second time we watched it and we finished it this time, we did MST3Klike comments throughout the movie.Summary Only watch this if you are a movie basher! Make hilarious comments, watch this at a sleepover for laughs, and I mean HUGE laughs. Also watch for mockery. The metaphor that explains this movie This movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and sock puppets!","label":0},{"index":1986,"txt":"Actually had to stop it. Do not get me wrong, love bad monster movies. But this one was way too boring, regardless of the suspenseful music that never leads you anywhere. The actress had too many teeth and that moment when she makes contact with one of the beasts, was way too obvious a clich\u00e9. This film totally betrays the cover on the DVD which looks pretty interesting. From the cover one expects a giant monster, but you get these cute not as gigantic as expected electric eels. Moved on to watch another film called The Killer Rats but that is another review. Deep Shock was really crap, a big shame considering the fact that it looks pretty high budget.","label":0},{"index":1987,"txt":"Completely ridiculous period film is only a thin excuse for its extensive, graphic depiction of the heroines affair with the beast, a monster who supposedly appears every century to rape some women. That is pretty much what he does, and the films depiction of the beast is really really awful; it is basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge PVC tube for a hardon that squirts copious amounts of white liquid. For fans of fake animal porn, I guess maybe this is a real turnon. I was amused, however, by the opening shots of horses having sex in a public square.","label":0},{"index":1988,"txt":"Deep SH.. is more like it! The eels are just cartooned in over the film.

The movie obviously has a pretty good budget. It has very good cinematography. It has nice pacing, good editing and pretty good directing too. Then WHY OH WHY did not they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and WHY OH WHY did they hire such lousy actors that cannot act their way out of a paper bag? This movie could have been good. At most times it LOOKS good and FEELS good but in the end, you realize that the movie was no good at all.So I would say it is a good production but a bad movie. Too bad actually.And eels? Come one, really!","label":0},{"index":1990,"txt":"This has to be the cheapest film made in 21st century. It is all the way low quality, but at the end it falls below... everything. All the cheap tricks  like flashing and darkness  are used to hide those crappy computer effects.All the actors are below average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher Simmone Mackinnon. There is a scene, where Anne is asked Why you seem so careless? The correct answer is, because she cannot act. No matter what happens the world is about to be destroyed, her friend is dying, she is fired, she has the same stupid grin in her face.It is not only the movie, which is B quality. It is also the back cover description at least in Finland. The text mentions things like Lorica Gray vessel, Capital vessel and main character Garrison Harper and Anna not Anne Fletcher. The description sounds like a different movie, both featuring character called Fletcher and sea monsters","label":0},{"index":1991,"txt":"Deep Shock plays out like a TV movie a whole cast of commercialquality actors, a poorly designed creature to be the bad guy, and a script that is more full of technical, political jargon and importances than it knows what to do with.I checked out the movie because of the creature I love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos, and right off the bat, I got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie. The actors I expected because of the type of film it is really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point. The music was typical, notthoughtout action symphonic music.I liked the design of the computers and technical equipment, along with the minisub design. The movie even flowed really well, with guiding screens letting you know which set you are watching the story unfold in. But there is not much of a story here anyways.This movie gets a 310 stars IMO. The boring search and destroy mission to blow up the North Pole and these creatures protecting it...kinda lame. Even lamer is the taggedon love relationship between two of the characters that you do not see coming. Chalk this one up to being a movie which tries to get actors careers off the bench and into a video. Do not bother.","label":0},{"index":1992,"txt":"A mediocre SciFi Channel original picture.

If nothing catastrophic happens before I die, this will be the biggest regret of my life. Who ever even thought about this movie, or financed deserves a kick between the legs, because that is where they were thinking when they made this movie. It is about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic, and writes pretentious drivel that tries to pass off as poetry. He joins his amorous friend in a trip to the coast. Where they meet girls and such. Only the fat guy does not get a girl. Skin flicks do not annoy me, I take em for face value. But this movie tries to be more than a skin flick. It is about Fat guy looking for love in some girl, but then meets another bikini silicone girl that enjoys his poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball which gets money for his family and impresses the ladies, only he has his lady anyways. The dialogue is superhorrible for even a C movie. It supports a ton of black stereotypes, no character development, it is a glorified porno movie, without any porn in it. Never ever watch this movie.","label":0},{"index":1996,"txt":"I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I sort of enjoyed it. The fat guy is the best character, as he seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the years attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also funny because the lowbudget babes in this movie are strictly homegirls. Most lowbudget movies have that local babe quality, and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the youngsters went wild over what was essentially some really overused, highmileage skank. There were some cuties too. That is the charm of these lowbudget crappy movies. You will see a lot of doggies, and some real cuties! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. Too bad. It would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a Where are they now book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on TV you wonder what ever happened to X?

Also with the 2 English boys... well I do not think any English boy has acted, spoke or dressed like any English kid in the history of the British nation since Prince William and Harrys preteen public appearances.

They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing.Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they did not go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I did not think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role.The film appears to have some fans, and I was very openminded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, Cats Meow and all his early ones from Targets to Nickleodeon. So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one.It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovichs exgirlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called Moonlighting stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines.Bottom line It as not no Paper Moon and only a very pale version of What is Up, Doc.","label":0}]}
