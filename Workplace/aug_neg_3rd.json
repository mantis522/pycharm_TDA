Out of the three Airport films I have seen so far I actually liked this one the best, just.  It has my sinking of the 747 maybe the makers were trying to cross the original Airport with another popular disaster flick of the period The Poseidon Adventure 1972  submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside, either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened  it is a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic characters, dull dialogue, lethargic setpieces  a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity.  While the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks  there is not as much urgency as I thought there should have been.  Even when the Navy become involved things do not pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships  helicopters flying about but there is just something lacking here.  George Kennedy as the jinxed airline worker Joe Patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes  barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background.The home video  theatrical version of Airport 77 run 108 minutes while the US TV versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence, many more scenes with George Kennedy as Patroni, flashbacks to flesh out characters, longer rescue scenes  the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator.  While I would like to see this extra footage I am not sure I could sit through a near three hour cut of Airport 77.  As expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions  interior design choices, I will say no more other than the toy plane model effects are not great either.  Along with the other two Airport sequels this takes pride of place in the Razzie Awards Hall of Shame although I can think of lots of worse films than this so I reckon that is a little harsh.  The action scenes are a little dull unfortunately, the pace is slow  not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as I reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly.The production values are alright if nothing spectacular.  The acting is not great, two time Oscar winner Jack Lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this, one time Oscar winner James Stewart looks old  frail, also one time Oscar winner Lee Grant looks drunk while Sir Christopher Lee is given little to do  there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too.Airport 77 is the most disaster orientated of the three Airport films so far  I liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly, the production  bland direction does not help though  a film about a sunken plane just should not be this boring or lethargic.  Followed by The Concorde ...  Airport 79 1979.",

		"This film lacked something I could not put my finger on at first charisma on the part of the leading actress.  This inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man.  Even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play.  It could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors.  I just do not know.But could it have been the screenplay?  Just exactly who was the chef in love with?  He seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant, and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits, than of anybody or anything else.  He convinced me But, do not forget it was nominated for an Oscar, so judge for yourself.",
		"Sorry everyone,,, I know this is supposed to be an art film,, but wow, they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch.  Although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent, this story is too painful to watch.  The absence of a sound track was brutal.  The loooonnnnng shots were too long.  How long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking?  Especially when the dialogue is two people complaining.  I really had a hard time just getting through this film.  The performances were excellent, but how much of that dark, sombre, uninspired, stuff can you take?  The only thing i liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene.  Otherwise this was a ripoff of Bergman.  And i am no fan f his either.  I think anyone",
		"When I was little my parents took me along to the theater to see Interiors.  It was one of many movies I watched with my parents, but this was the only one we walked out of.  Since then I had never seen Interiors until just recently, and I could have lived out the rest of my life without it.  What a pretentious, ponderous, and painfully boring piece of 70s wine and cheese tripe.  Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors but Interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career.  In the unmistakable style of Ingmar Berman, Allen gives us a dark, angular, muted, insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce, estrangement, career, love, nonlove, halitosis, whatever.  The film, intentionally, has no comic relief, no music, and is drenched in shadowy pathos.  This film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature, using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a more pronounced depth of meaning and truth.  But Woody Allen is no Ingmar Bergman.  The film is painfully slow and dull.  But beyond that, I simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters.  Instead I felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling, whining, nicotine stained, martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity.  Amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked Brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room.  Everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes.  Everyone find direction It is never about resolution, it is only about interminable introspective babble.  It is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audiences ability to connect.  Woody Allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out.  And for that reason I found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining.  I see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through Prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance.  I highly recommend this one if you are feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death.  Otherwise, let us just pretend this film never happened.",

		"The second attempt by a New York intellectual in less than 10 years to make a Swedish film  the first being Susan Sontags Brother Carl which was made in Sweden, with Swedish actors, no less!  The results?  Oscar Wilde said it best, in reference to Dickens The Old Curiosity Shop One would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of Little Nell.  Pretty much the same thing here.  Interiors is chock I am afraid of my anger.  Looking into the middle distance I do not like who I am becoming.  The directorial quotations to use a polite term from Bergman are close to parody.  The incredibly selfinvolved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of strangulation.  I read a poem of yours the other day.  It was in  I do not know  The New Yorker.  Oh.  That was an old poem.  I reworked it.  Far from not caring about these people, however, I found them quite hilarious.  Much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from Allens earlier films  only he is directed his actors to play the lines straight.  Having not cast himself in the movie, he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copy all of his thespian tics, intonations, and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing surrogate much like Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity.The basic plot  dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother  seems to be lifted more or less from Bergmans Winter Light, the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst.  It all comes through in the shopworn visualaural tricks the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach. etc, etc.Allens later serious films are less embarrassing, but also far less entertaining.  I will take Interiors.  Woodys rarely made a funnier movie.",

I felt as if I was watching a movie from the 70s.  The subject was just not believable for the year 2007, even being set in DC.

Many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just did not know how to finish them.  He jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on.  I really did not get Woodys Carter private life or boyfriend either.

		"This film is one giant pant load.  Paul Schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay.  And his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process.  The worst though is Woody Harrelson, whom I ordinarily like when he is properly cast.  He plays the walker, a homosexual man in D.C. who plays social companion to the bored wives of the Washington elite.  He could not have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick.  His southern accent is that off the rack version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers, as though the heat and humidity of the South is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has.  It is monotonous.  But, his is not the worst accent in the movie.  His boyfriend, played by Moritz Bleibtreau, attempts to affect some kind of a Mid East accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him.  He rolling his That is kind of a good reason to cast someone else do not ya think?  From the story, to the screenplay, to the directing, to the camera work, to the performances by the leads, this movie is bad from beginning to end.  The only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall, and Kristin Scott Thomas.  Only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact.  In fact, all three are excellent, in spite of being trapped in a really bad film.  Ufortunately, no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws.  If you like these three actresses, watch them in something else.  This movie is not worth your time.",
		"The plot for Descent, if it actually can be called a plot, has two noteworthy events.  One near the beginning  one at the end.  Together these events make up maybe 5 of the total movie time.  Everything and I mean _everything_ in between is basically the directors desperate effort to fill in the minutes.  I expect me Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here.  And no, she does not get naked, not even in the NC17 version, which I saw.If you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch Descent, take a nap instead  you will probably have more interesting dreams.",

		"I rented this on DVD and I kind of feel bad since Dawson and Lugacy are so earnest about it in the DVD comments.  It is not a bad movie exactly, but it is one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre.  Plus, it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways, and the characters behavior often strains belief.  I say its Otherwise, its point has been made before and more artfully.  And that gets to the big problem, which is that it really does not have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point.  It ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling, and it does not really pay off.",

Plus, it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways, and the characters behavior often strains belief.  I would say its a film that you would get something out of if you do not have a lot of filmTVliteraturelife behind you to be honest, I have seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even.  Otherwise, its point has been made before and more artfully.  And that gets to the big problem, which is that it really does not have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point.  It invests everything",

But nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland.  Thumbs down!  Performances Anil Kapoor, is a veteran actor.  But how could he okay a role like this?  Akshay Kumar is great actor, in fact he is the sole saving grace.  Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot.  She looks stunning and leaves you, all stand up.

		"Summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what is the hottest movie of the week, given 99.9 of the screens dedicated to screening it.  OK, so I may exaggerate on the percentage, but you get my drift.  Besides stuff from Hollywood, Bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters, and from some of the trailers shown, I am hyped to watch them too.  Tashan was billed as one of THE most highly anticipated for 2008, but I was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas.  When I watched Jodha Akbar, it was a full house, but it was not for Tashan.After watching it, I knew why.  It was entertaining, but it was fundamentally weak.  Just like it is literal English title, which means Style, Tashan is all style, but little substance.  Not that it does not have the usual star power, but scenes felt forced, and some bordered on a tad ridiculous, even for Bollywood standards I must say.  Which is quite surprising given that Tashan is directed and written by Vijay Krishna Acharya, who wrote Dhoom and Dhoom 2, both of which I enjoyed tremendously.  In his rookie directorial outing with Tashan, while you cannot fault his direction, you would probably scratch your head over the plot, which was clunky at best.  It blown action And in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink, you have an assortment of vehicles appearing, and the one that took the cake, in a Dhoom 2 homage, was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere.At best, Tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy, and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters.  Saif Ali Khan plays Jimmy Cliff, a call center executive who gives English tuition, only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material.  His playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with Pooja Singh Kareena Kapoor, who is not exactly who she seems, the meek and sweet natured hottie.  She engages Jimmys services for her boss, mobster Bhaiyyaji Anil Kapoor, who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken English and phrases must like how an ahbeng does it.  And to complete the quartet, Akshay Kumar plays Bachchan Pandey, an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by Bhaiyyaji to hunt down Jimmy and Pooja when they escape with money stolen from Bahiyyajis business.So begins a road trip of sorts, with friends who turned enemies, and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on.  Jimmy Cliff is probably the most implausible of all, because he goes from zero to hero, executing moves that would shame Rambo, in absolutely no time, which is quite out of character.  Kareena Kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men, and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes, and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee.  Every character has a backstory created, and I thought Akshay Kumars Bachchan Pandey was probably the best, the most touching and the most fun of the lot, even though his character seemed a lot like a nongreen Incredible Hulk with his gravitydefying leaps and power packing punches.  His wounds also heal automatically, which impressively puts Wolverine to shame.  And the best part is his theme song, which is damn alphamale and played in rara mode each time he takes on adversaries.But sad to say, that is the only tune that is memorable, something that cheers Bachchan PandeyBachchanPandey.  For most Bollywood movies I watch, I will usually be able to, despite the obvious language gaps, emerge from screenings humming a tune or two.  I was not able to do that after Tashan, because the songs unfortunately just were not catchy at all.  Usually the songdance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location.  That I enjoy, versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain, or atop jagged rocks on the beach front.Tashan probably did not take itself too seriously, but coming from Vijay Krishna Acharyas story, you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous, and for continuity to be a little more careful as well.  Billed as a blockbuster, now I can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one.  Despite Akshay Kumr stealing the show, Tashan could have been better on the whole.",

How come they handled such a heavy project to new Vijay Krishna Acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick?  He imitate Sanjay The action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences.The story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences hearts.  In most scenes Anil Kapoor reminds me of southern Tamil star Rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions.  I am not a fan of neither Saif nor Akshay, but the award of Kareena should have finally gone to Saifs hand instead of Akshay.  Just from the starting point I expected of it, but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth.  Saif is the main behind the whole adventure, while Akshay joins in the midst.  In any movie, the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit.  And Tashan loses in this way, and unexpectedly failed to become a hit.Akshays has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies.  He seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again.  In between Saif did a great job in Race, and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie.  But he has fully developed himself in the acting field.  And last but not the least about Kareena.  She looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean.  But I myself do not think so, instead she became slim.  Yes slim!!!  it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people or say, male.  Beside them it is nice that Saifs son Ibrahim appears in the beginning  last as young Saif.  I hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career.Those who like this Tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood, or say want to be admitted in an asylum.  Thumbs down to debutante director Vijay Krishna Acharya who mishandled the project offered by Yash Raj Films.  In future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 years before going into practical directions.Sorry, I do not like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies.",

This is height of stupidity.  Audience is not paying to watch such stupidity.  I think Bollywood now should forget about the action movies.  They cant make it.  The last good action I have seen was from Ghatak and Khiladiyon ka Khialdi.  The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me.  Does these people see their movie after completion?  Cannot they figure out that the slow motion action which is done using ropes is too unrealistic and childish?  Better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it.  I just want to go back to Amitabhs era where movie like Zanjeer and Deewar were having thrilling action scenes.  The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but visually it is much better than current era scenes.  This movie now should open the eyes of the Bollywood movie directors.

		"I was very displeased with this move.  Everything was terrible from the start.  The comedy was unhumorous, the action overdone, the songs unmelodious.  Even the storyline was weightless.  From a writer who has written successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom, I had high expectations.  The actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all.  Of course, Kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds.  I think Hindi They tend to exaggerate way too much.  In Chinese films, this style works because that is their signature piece.  But, Hindi cinemas signature are the songs.  A good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic.  But, in the future, I am sure these action movies will get much sharper.  Also to be noted Comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly.  Good Luck next time.",

Hell allow me Please if you want to torture yourself, go ahead watch this.",
		"Sometime I fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie...  I do it But after loads of amazing promos, Tashan finally ended as heart attack.Such amazing 3 songs in promo  Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein..... and what u get in the movie?  Zero story, predictable plot, plenty of Akshay Kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching Kareena after her major weight loss...!!! Musicwise another major disaster... in the music album, they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these 4 jokers and they have not thought of giving the background song of the scenes when Akshay Kumar is doing stunts...!  that song is such nice, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and that is not taken in the music album!!!   If you plan to watch this movie, i would say, watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like ...Bachchan Bachchan Pandey...Overall very disappointed even with the way Bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad English! Go away man, i need to puke!",

Kareena improved her Akshay is good.  Anil is also good.  May I say the role was not good..Great deal of cheapness is filled in.  Wondered if that was supposed to be the comedy part of the movie.  Just because last few movies were flops does that mean Yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish?  It has a history of so many good films.  Overall, I was totally disappointed with the movie.",

		"...for this movie defines a new low in Bollywood and has set the standard against which all cp must now be compared.First off, the beginning did have elements of style....and if handled well, could have become a cult classic, ala pulp fiction or a Desi desperado...but the plot was there one?  begins to meander and at one point completely loses it.Throw in a deranged don with an obsession for English, a call center smart Alec, a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a Saree with the same aplomb, a levitating, gravity defying hitman and a cop with a hundred or was it a thousand black cat commandos on their trail....good ingredients in competent hands.  But this is where I would like to ask the director Sir, what were you smoking? Im done insult Possibly the only redeeming feature in this Desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music...watch the videos...hear the airplay and you wont be disappointed.  Vishal Shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes.

		"The sight of Kareena Kapoor in a twopiece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching Tashan  the megadisappointing, mindnumbing new film at the cinemas this weekend.  Bad films are bad films and we see some every week, but Tashan is not just a bad film, it is a terrible film.  Terrible because it takes its audience for granted, terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they have got big movie stars onboard.Written and directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya, Tashan is what you would describe as a road movie, but one that is going in all the wrong directions.  Saif Ali Khan stars as Jimmy Cliff, a callcentre executive who is hired to teach English to Bhaiyyaji  that is Anil Kapoor playing an ambitious UP gangster, desperate to go cool.  Jimmys got his Determined to recover his money and also to punish both Jimmy and Pooja, Bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job.  So you have Akshay Kumar as Bachchan Pandey, the gangsters faithful aide from Kanpur, who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that is hidden across the length and breadth of the country.Much like those bad eighties potboilers, Tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot.  But the treatments so overthetop, so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect.  Instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional threeact structure, you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed.  That garish item song in the desert, the bulletdodging action scene at a Rajasthani fort, Kareeenas bikini moment, even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks, a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala, and believe it or not, even a Dhannostyle horsedriven tonga.  In all fairness, not all these set pieces are badly done  the item song in the desert is quite neat actually  but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture, because you are just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really.  Little do you expect in a seemingly fastpaced road movie, to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts.You see the problem with Tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making.  What is more, I do not think they cared either  the film reeks of arrogance.  Arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work, Tashan is like an overcooked stew.There are films that kill you softly, and then there is Tashan, a film that kills you with excess.  Packaged snazzily with glossyfinish camerawork, exotic locations and fancy costumes, every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together, but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story does not hold.  Borrowing narrative from Tarantino and style from Stephen Chow does not help either because they do not blend with the films waferthin plot.  One may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging, but Anil Kapoors grating Hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists, and Saif Ali Khan fumbles through the film foolishly, unable to find his feet.

		"The sight of Kareena Kapoor in a twopiece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching Tashan  the megadisappointing, mindnumbing new film at the cinemas this weekend.  Bad films are bad films and we see some every week, but Tashan is not just a bad film, it is a terrible film.  Terrible because it takes its audience for granted, terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they have got big movie stars onboard.Written and directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya, Tashan is what you would describe as a road movie, but one that is going in all the wrong directions.  Saif Ali Khan stars as Jimmy Cliff, a callcentre executive who is hired to teach English to Bhaiyyaji  that is Anil Kapoor playing an ambitious UP gangster, desperate to go cool.  Jimmys got his eye on Pooja, the gangsters pretty young assistant played by Kareena Kapoor, who uses Jimmy to swindle her boss of 25 crore rupees.  Determined to recover his money and also to punish both Jimmy and Pooja, Bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job.  So you have Akshay Kumar as Bachchan Pandey, the gangsters faithful aide from Kanpur, who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that is hidden across the length and breadth of the country.Much like those bad eighties potboilers, Tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot.  But the treatments so overthetop, so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect.  Instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional threeact structure, you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed.  That garish item song in the desert, the bulletdodging action scene at a Rajasthani fort, Kareeenas bikini moment, even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks, a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala, and believe it or not, even a Dhannostyle horsedriven tonga.  In all fairness, not all these set pieces are badly done  the item song in the desert is quite neat actually  but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture, because you are just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really.  Little do you expect in a seemingly fastpaced road movie, to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts.You see the problem with Tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making.  What is more, I do not think they cared either  the film reeks of arrogance.  Arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work, Tashan is like an overcooked stew.There are films that kill you softly, and then there is Tashan, a film that kills you with excess.  Packaged snazzily with glossyfinish camerawork, exotic locations and fancy costumes, every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together, but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story does not hold.  Borrowing narrative from Tarantino and style from Stephen Chow does not help either because they do not blend with the films waferthin plot.  One may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging, but Anil Kapoors grating Hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists, and Saif Ali Khan fumbles through the film foolishly, unable to find his feet.  Kareena Kapoor, meanwhile, queen of overthetop delivery, does a decent job.  But of course, if Tashan is salvaged to some extent, it is thanks to Akshay Kumars irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character.

		"This is the biggest Flop of 2008.  I is his The songs have been added without situations, the story have been stretched to fill the 3 hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it is like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people.  Only the best performance was by Anil Kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking Hinglish...  Akki is also done a good job....  But the movieee just forget it.",
		"All the world said that the film Tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure, but this is not the case.  Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress Kareena Kapoor.  She was unbearable throughout the film.  Her tomboy look does not really goes well.  Even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all.  Everyone is Vijay The talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid movie.  Anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not.  Akshay Kumar has also been a victim of this film as all is Saif.  The Style and the Phoormola is not really good in this film i was disappointed",

I just cannot see every single bloke on Earth suddenly knowing the Bible  starting to believe in God, I just found the notion ridiculous  the show also states clearly that there is nothing religious about what is going on so what is the deal with everyone thinking they have a divine to murder any woman they see?

I know there is a brief scene which makes a joke out of the gay issue but it is conveniently brushed to one side  then there is the thing which annoyed me the most.  The fact that presumably every bloke on earth has turned psycho  killed all the women they go about their everyday business like nothing ever happened, it just felt so stupid, the plotting is rubbish  to round things off there is a ending which looks like it was taken from a rejected episode of The XFiles 1993  2002 with a bright neon alien.Director Dante on this showing definitely does not qualify as a Master of Horror as far a I am concerned, the story is badly paced, it is just so stupid considering it is played deadly straight  instead of trying to make a proper horror show he turns in more of a thriller with it is deadly virus on the loose situation  the subsequent mother  daughter on the run because of it, there is very little here in the way of what I would call effective horror  even less gore.

The cops in the city of Edison are so corrupt they shoot their suspects, steal their money, and snort their dope.  Whether he is out to impress his girlfriend herein, called Pussy or win a Pulitzer, the citys corruption does NOT sit well with the noble Mr.  Timberlake.Timberlake decides to investigate the corruption, which reaches both unexpected scope and lifethreatening levels of danger.  Writerdirector David J.  Burke keeps the film above water, but just barely.  LL Cool J beats Timberlake in the pop star to movie star sweepstakes aka the rapper to actor progression.  Mr.  McDermott has fun with his role.  Lending gravitas to the proceedings are sagely supporting actors Morgan Freeman as Moses Ashford and Kevin Spacey as Levon Wallace.

		"I gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned.  From the domestic violence, to sexuality and many of the taboos therein.  Outside of the gore I really would not call this horror so much as I would science fiction.It is bleak, depressing and hopeless.  While I do not mind a less than cheery ending, I am really very tired of the humans suck clich? that is central to every movie.  I know you Right now, if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find a lake and swim til your arms are tired.  This way you will not be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me I deserve to die for being alive.  It is silly, not thoughtful, and boring.",
		"I am not alone in admiring the first Superman movie, a film that Richard Donner executed masterfully.  I brings us It does not matter who directed Superman 2 because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader.  In a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do, unlike the original superman.  With or without his powers, Supermans strength or lack thereof is handled in the least believable manner.  There is too much to criticize, so I will not bother.  I condemn this movie... perhaps the slapstick in the Lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on.  SuperDuper bad.",

		"I loved it Kids no longer had to impatiently wait for Superman to appear on screen, as in part I.  Now as an adult, I can see how the mighty had fallen with S2T See my review.  I have always heard of the backstory on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the originals director, Richard Donner from part II.  It must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously, now it is common Back to the Future and Matrix 2  3 for example.  Unfortunately, after finally seeing the Richard Donner Cut or, S2RD I still cannot fully recommend it.  Gone, was the great Superman change scene, the entire Paris rescue, as was the wonderful recap of part I in S2Ts opening.  In fact, they all but wrote the words Previously on Superman in S2RD.  The special effects were not great in either Part I or S2T , but S2RD, they were mostly downright laughable  such as Lois falling from the Daily Planet window.  I will admit, some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures, such as any scene in the honeymoon suite.  Overall, if you grew up on S2T as I did, and loved it as a child  not nitpicking as I do as an adult, you should absolutely see S2RD as it is almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes.  Spoiler alert Unfortunately, the worst change comes last gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from S2T replaced with the exact same ending as I.  This is not only a lazy, unoriginal copout, it does not make sense on why Clark would go back to that diner, if those events never actually happened.  And will he continue to turn back time for every confrontation?",
		"I grew up on the Superman II theatrical version S2T and as a kid, I loved it more than Part I since not only did it contain more Superman and three Supermantype villains, it started off with a bang  the best Clark Kent to Superman transformations and rescue scenes.

		"So...we get so see added footage of Brando...interesting but not exactly Oscar worthy stuff.  Susannah York was hardly a slouch.  New scene where Lois finds out Clark is Superman is slightly unbelievable in that he does not notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets.  Real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that...let us listen to Donner make fun of Lesters version that made more logical sense.  The president talks of the Zod defacing the Washington monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore.  Tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd.  Supermans freedom of the press line sounded silly compared to ..Care to step outside which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to Clarks earlier scene in the truck stop.  Then there is the ending with the turn back the world to go back in time effect.  It made you",
		"Superman II  The Richard Donner Cut should be a fans dream come true.  At long last, footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life.  A director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored.  It seems like a winning situation.  And then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this esoteric dream is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence.  While it is entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project.  And it is only a very few times.You know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics.  But then we start seeing new footage alternates from Superman  The Movie for the trial and that first bit of hesitation fades away.  Hey, this is pretty neat!  Things see footage And from this point on, it never ever lets up.  It is probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects, but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was You will Believe A Man Can Fly it is difficult to believe anything shown on screen here.  The best effects in this are from the original productions.Another issue with this recut.  A lot of it just does not make sense.  The only reason any of it really works is because we have all seen the theatrical version of Superman II, a movie that does make sense.  Lesters Superman II fills in the holes of this assembly.  Part of this could be because Donner did not get to complete shooting, the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little Lester material as possible.  What we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes Superman IV look airtight and coherent.After viewing this, one gets the sense that while Lester was faithful and comfortable using Donner material, Michael Thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by Lester.  The best scenes in The Donner Cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of Superman II.  That includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence, not ironically, both were filmed by Donner.  But anything else from that movie filmed by Lester is reedited in such a hasty fashion, that it now makes Lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing.  While Lester honored the Donner material, Lester here is thrown under the bus.So is there anything good in this release?  Well Marlon Brando is in it, and that is neat to see.  In fact watching any of the material shot by Donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as Superman  The Movie.  But that only highlights the problems of this release.  Any of the major scenes really just Lois jumping and scenes with Marlon Brando would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section.  Instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used sloppy edits and bad decisions.Watch the opening scene at the Daily Planet.  Why are we looking at Jackie Coopers back as he calls for Lois and Clark?  At the end why do we have Lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by Jackie Cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on?  I was initially confused by this, because I expected to see Lois.  The entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this.Battle scenes are a mess too, with no geography between cuts.  It is just random action.  Of course, the major action scenes were shot by Lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of Donner outtakes or alternates.  They should have used more of Lesters footage, but probably had too much pride to admit that.The sloppiness extends to the military missile as well.  As noted elsewhere, the missile shown in The Donner Cut bears the designation XK 10 while we all know it is the XK 101!  A blind man in STM knows that!  The producers of this assembly, who tried so hard to honor the original film, dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production.  For all the supposed care that was put into this, the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable.The entire affair would probably be easier to digest if Warners did not make this a separate release here in the states.  As it is, we are expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a Play All option.  It is really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes, but after that initial viewing, I expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else.  I know after my experience of watching this, I had new respect for Lesters version.  It is by no means perfect, but Lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief.  He managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so, while this new recut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history.",

They admit that.The As noted elsewhere, the missile shown in The Donner Cut bears the designation XK 10 while we all know it is the XK 101!  A blind man in STM knows that!  The producers of this assembly, who tried so hard to honor the original film, dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production.  For all the supposed care that was put into this, the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable.The entire affair would probably be easier to digest if Warners did not make this a separate release here in the states.  As it is, we are expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a Play All option.  It is really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes, but after that initial viewing, I expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else.  I know after my experience of watching this, I had new respect for Lesters version.  It is by no means perfect, but Lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief.  He managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so, while this new recut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history.",
		"The Curse of Frankenstein sticks faithfully to Mary Shelleys story for one word of the title, which would not be so bad if the changes were any good at all.  The tragedy of the creature destroying Frankensteins family has been completely excised and replaced with... nothing.  The heart and moral centre of the story is gone.  It deserves everything The plot is basically a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clich?s.  Even taken on its own terms, this is rubbish a bland, rambling film featuring a shitelooking creature with a pudding bowl haircut.  As it is the first of Hammers horror films, directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, its place in horror history is secure.  But it is crap.",

The plot SUCKED.  The voice acting SUCKED.  The animation SUCKED.  The ending REALLY SUCKED.  If you liked this movie, YOU SUCK TOO.  And to Futuramafan1987, who said this was the greatest movie ever, you are a TOOL, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.  This is not a movie for anyone but crackaddled tenyear olds with Game Boys who think Pikachu is God.  I am still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movie....and then there was Pikachus Adventure...do not even get me started on that horrible mess of a film.  It is, in all truth, one of the most boring experiences of my entire life.  Do not go watch this at any costs.Bottom Line Go out, find every copy of this movie that you can, and burn it.

		"Now i have never ever seen a bad movie in all my years but what is with songs in the movie what physiological meaning does it have.  WOW some demented Pok?mon shows up and they multiply i can get a seizure from this.  Animie understand whats It is just an animation it should be on video.Ps i will give it a 1 because i just got 5 bucks i could not give it a half because there is no halves.",

Animie is pointless the makers of it are pointless its a big marketing scheme look just cut down on songs and they will get a good rating i reckon that this movie would have been fine if they put out a message you must see all the Pok?mon episodes to understand whats going on and it is not a film.  It give it",

		"I figured that it is about time I let this one out.  Pok?mon fans are suffering in America these days.  Why?  Because we rely on Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies.  As far as the series goes, they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television.  So what is their problem when it comes to the movies?  Honestly now, I have seen all three Pok?mon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one.  They are excellent movies.  They are all enjoyable and fun to watch.  And, after seeing Pok?mon 2000 in theaters, I cannot help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts.  The way it appears, it seems that they read and see something that says Insert empty moral here in big bold faced letters.  It guess I My first gripe with this came with no narration.  I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pok?dex narration that plagued Pikachus Vacation, and, instead of going with a caring, gentle womans voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai, they just cut the narration all together.  This would not have been a problem, except for one thing.  Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute did not let Togepi go until the end?  Possibly the fans, but I am sure not the parents.  Then, there is the theme song.  I could not help but roll my eyes at this one.  The Japanese theme song was Tankentai wo Tsukurou and was sung by Japanese children.  It was fun and enjoyable.  This one nauseating.  Now, one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana.  Nice music, fun to watch.  That is changed with the Bellossom.  The music sucked for one, but on top of that, they had all the Pok?mon talk during the music, which turned out to be jumpy, annoying, and just unnecessary.  Oh, and then there is the Poliwhirl who thinks he is a Poliwrath.  You would think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are.  Basically, not much could save this little ill fated dub, which is very unfortunate considering its potential.  But, I have not touched on the worst of it yet.You would think that the warning signs would have been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power.  For some unfathomable reason, I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB.  My thoughts were well, they screwed up on the first movie, but the second is different as far as the theme goes, so they should do well.  That in mind, I just did not pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said, You will believe that one person can make all the difference.  With the way they said that at every turn, I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version.  Then comes Nintendo Power, in which I see all my fears realized in the words the main feature The Power of One.  At that point, I became a bit more uneasy.  The Power of One?!  Not a good sign.  However, I still kept some of my false faith.  Big mistake.Sitting in the theater, I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk.  I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle.  I can see a point in that since they did not pander this thing, repeating it over and over like in MSB.  However, it did more damage than anything else in this movie.  First of all, the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to Ash.  Ah hah.  So, Ash is the chosen one?  Whatever.  In the Japanese version, the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pok?mon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony.  This time, he is the chosen one.  A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia.  Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pok?mon movie.... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia.  In this one, Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash.  In the scene where they are flying back to the main island, Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugias existence, not that Ash is going to make all the difference.  Overall in this category, Ash was not really the one person that would make the difference, since he was helped by many along the way.A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking.  Fururas flute song was not nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one.  Jirarudans speech to them saying his collection started with a Mew card?  Ugh.  Even worse, Mistys outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held.  Why did not you put them in Pok?balls when you caught them?  This is like caging them to be displayed.  Much different from whining about him thinking Pok?mon are things to be collected like stamps.  If there were any real redeeming values in this, they came from Team Rocket.  Some pretty funny lines.  Not really to make me laugh out loud, but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach.  Well, that was officially the last American Pok?mon movie I am going to see.  I have imported the third one and find it very enjoyable.  I would rather not see another Japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two.  I will be importing the fourth one as well.  Forget you, Kids WB and 4Kids.  You have forsaken me for the last time.",

		"I figured that it is about time I let this one out.  Pok?mon fans are suffering in America these days.  Why?  Because we rely on Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies.  As far as the series goes, they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television.  So what is their problem when it comes to the movies?  Honestly now, I have seen all three Pok?mon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one.  They are excellent movies.  They are all enjoyable and fun to watch.  And, after seeing Pok?mon 2000 in theaters, I cannot help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts.  The way it appears, it seems that they read and see something that says Insert empty moral here in big bold faced letters.  It definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on MSB extreme sarcasm there and created this crap.possible spoilers from here onWell, I guess I should first talk about Pikachus Rescue Adventure.  My first gripe with this came with no narration.  I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pok?dex narration that plagued Pikachus Vacation, and, instead of going with a caring, gentle womans voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai, they just cut the narration all together.  This would not have been a problem, except for one thing.  Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute did not let Togepi go until the end?  Possibly the fans, but I am sure not the parents.  Then, there is the theme song.  I could not help but roll my eyes at this one.  The Japanese theme song was Tankentai wo Tsukurou and was sung by Japanese children.  It was fun and enjoyable.  This one nauseating.  Now, one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana.  Nice music, fun to watch.  That is changed with the Bellossom.  The music sucked for one, but on top of that, they had all the Pok?mon talk during the music, which turned out to be jumpy, annoying, and just unnecessary.  Oh, and then there is the Poliwhirl who thinks he is a Poliwrath.  You would think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are.  Basically, not much could save this little ill fated dub, which is very unfortunate considering its potential.  But, I have not touched on the worst of it yet.You would think that the warning signs would have been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power.  For some unfathomable reason, I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB.  My thoughts were well, they screwed up on the first movie, but the second is different as far as the theme goes, so they should do well.  That in mind, I just did not pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said, You will believe that one person can make all the difference.  With the way they said that at every turn, I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version.  Then comes Nintendo Power, in which I see all my fears realized in the words the main feature The Power of One.  At that point, I became a bit more uneasy.  The Power of One?!  Not a good sign.  However, I still kept some of my false faith.  Big mistake.Sitting in the theater, I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk.  I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle.  I can see a point in that since they did not pander this thing, repeating it over and over like in MSB.  However, it did more damage than anything else in this movie.  First of all, the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to Ash.  Ah hah.  So, Ash is the chosen one?  Whatever.  In the Japanese version, the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pok?mon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony.  This time, he is the chosen one.  A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia.  Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pok?mon movie.... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia.  In this one, Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash.  In the scene where they are flying back to the main island, Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugias existence, not that Ash is going to make all the difference.  Overall in this category, Ash was not really the one person that would make the difference, since he was helped by many along the way.A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking.  Fururas flute song was not nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one.  Jirarudans saying his Ugh.  Even worse, Mistys outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held.  Why did not you put them in Pok?balls when you caught them?  This is like caging them to be displayed.  Much different from whining about him thinking Pok?mon are things to be collected like stamps.

		"This is an awful film.  Yea the girls are pretty but its not very good.  The plot having a cowboy get involved with an Indian maiden would be interesting if the sex did not get in the way.  Well, okay it might be interesting, but its not, because its so badly paced and and only partly acted.  I can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen, probably more laughable then they do on TV.  I will not even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest.  Never read about that in the old west This is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward.I like schlock films but this is ridiculous.  There is a reason that I do not go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good, the plot taking a back seat to breasts.  The original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats.  The clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent.  The comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level, infantile but harmlessly fun.  Something filming wrapped.Obviously",
		"OK so I hear about this new Justin Timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names.  I mean great actors like, The Freeman aka Morgan Freeman, an asset to Hollywood, however completely wasted in this film.  Then we got Kevin Spacey, who I have been a great fan of ever since I watched American Beauty and The Usual Suspects.  Both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as I did when I heard the story.  Then enter a fresh faced Justin Timberlake.  I hit him Well the reason for that , I might add, is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review.  The movie is so terrible that when i got into the first 15 minutes of it.  The characters were so one dimensional that it makes some Bible characters look like the Don Corleone.  They got the one liners and soundbite worthy stuff.  The token troubled black guy LL COOL J who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life.  The captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone.  And what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience.  Oh and lots of gun fire, i mean a whole lot.  SPOILERNOT!!!  THe kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who is crooked dead and the hero prevails.  They got flame throwers and rocket launchers, REally no kidding.Bottom line if you want to see Edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors, or a great fan of Justin Timberlake, to all the 13 year old girls out there, enjoy!!  I wish i had more hands, because then I would have more thumbs, because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening.MAY GD HAVE MERCY ON US ALL and save us from these terrible movies.  Well it could be worst, another RNB terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher, hehe check out IN THE MIX lol, or even Get rich or die trying.  Now the special thing about that movie is that its got 30 year old men, playing 16 or even younger teens.  I could go on with these.",

		"I saw this film at its premier at Sundance 09.Since American Beauty is a movie that had something to say, I had hopes for Towelhead.  Unfortunately, it was a disappointment.  In fact, of countless movies I have seen in almost a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance movie I have ever wanted to walk out early from.The worst problem with Towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of provocative concepts concerning cultural stereotypes, rather than with an organic human drama.  The screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by Alicia Erian.  The famous Edith Wharton quote comes to mind I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the authors political views.  That observation is especially devastating for Towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic.  If there ever was a time when Towelheads white male villains, condescending portrayals of blacks, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc., were fresh, it is long past.For a more detailed review, please look up any of the many professional reviews available online.  Almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on.On the other hand, the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled.  As you read through the reviews in this and similar sites, you will frequently come across superlatives stunning, breathtaking, profound, shocking, ...  It embarrasses me Indeed, I have encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial, cultural, gender, or sexual issues as deeply moving, thought provoking, full of profound insight.  If you are such a person, by all means, rent Towelhead and be moved by it.  On the other hand, if you set your standards higher, you can safely pass on this one.",

So of course I remember watching Grease since I was a little girl, while it was never my favorite musical or story, it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it is still a lot of fun to watch.  I called them First off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it was not really clever, not to mention they just used the same characters, but with different names and actors.  Tell me, how did the Pink Ladies and TBirds continue years on after the former gangs left?  Not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy, gee, what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these TBirds were just stupid and ridiculous.Another year at Rydell and the music and dancing has not stopped.  But when a new student who is Sandys cousin comes into the scene, he is love struck by a pink lady, Stephanie.  But she must stick to the code where only Pink Ladies must stick with the TBirds, so the new student, decides to train as a TBird to win her heart.  So he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the TBirds butts.  But will he tell Stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own?  Well, find out for yourself.Grease 2 is like a silly TV show of some sort that did not work.  The gang did not click as well as the first Grease did, not to mention Frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable, because I thought that she graduated from Rydell, but apparently she did not.  The songs were not really that catchy; I am glad that Michelle was able to bounce back so fast, but that is probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel, I would not really recommend this film, other than if you are curious, but I warned you, this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical.210",
		"Boygirl love affairsequel with songs, only this time she is the punkette and he is the straight arrow.  Moviebuffs out there actually like this movie?  It has fans I must say, the mind reels...  Grease 2 is a truly lame enterprise that does not even have the courage, moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames like Jaws 2 or Exorcist II.  No, it whimpers along in slowmotion and often just plays dead.  It looks and feels cheap, with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling.  This was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of Michelle Pfeiffer and, although she does not embarrass herself, it is a role worth forgetting.  A misfire on the lowest of levels.  NO STARS from ",
		"When I was 11, Grease 2 was like crack.  It was a classless, shameful, euphoric, and powerfully addictive experience.  My sister and I would watch it, rewind it, and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another.  So, if you are an 11year old girl, and you reviewed this film as brilliant or fun or better than the original Grease, you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass.If, however, you are not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything but an inane, artless, slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production, distribution, andor consumption.For the sake of criticism, I will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows 1.  In a wellexecuted musical, the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters.  In Grease 2, with a few debatable exceptions, to the music is obscenely pointless.  Most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way Score Tonight, Reproduction, Do It For Our Country, and Prowlin without making one concrete statement about any of the films characters or themes.  Plus, all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance.2.  The Tbirds should be badass, and if not at least somewhat likable, but instead each of them is an annoying wussydufusloser.  In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred Tbird jacket and initiates him into the gang, Michael should kick it to the ground, spit on it, and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it.  But of course, he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads, there is no greater honor than to be one with the Tbirds. 3.  Since Michael is beautiful, smart, kind, resourceful, and above average in everyway his musical impotence notwithstanding, it is feasible that Stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask.  Stephanie, on the other hand, is a slovenly, slackjawed, bubble gum smacking, dirty sweatshirt wearing, gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat.  So aside from being pretty I guess, she harbors no likable characteristics, thus, audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of Michaels attraction to her.I could go on and on, but I did not want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair.  I reliving your Only you are 32 now and kissing a snotnosed 13year old kid with acne and slobby braces.  The magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed.  Trust me.",
		"I found it I managed to stomach 4550 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching Monster House instead which, by the way, is great fun.The story has massive holes in it.  The plot line is hugely over stated and dull, the acting is awful, especially from Justin TImberlake who should really stick to what he is good at looking daft and singing like a castrato.  Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and Timberlake meet.  Freeman and Timberlakes characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of fatherson relationship of sorts or something, which simply is not evident at all apart from the fact that; though Freemans character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of Timberlake, he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up.It would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line, which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion.Do not watch this film, it is a pure waste of time.",

		"I had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now An Unexpected Love.  It is not really worth looking for but I was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian flick on Lifetime.  Everythings pretty restrained and you do not really get an idea of who these characters are so, as a viewer, I was not able to become emotionally invested in the storyline.  I guess I Everythings muted and soft focus and earth tones...nothings very interesting.  I had a prurient interest in seeing two women make out but it is handled so discreetly that I was disappointed.  Rent Personal Best instead.",
		"I laughed all the way through this rotten movie.  It is so unbelievable.  A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a breakdown in front of a real estate office.  What happens?  The office manager comes outside and offers her a job!!!  Hilarious!  Next thing you know the two women are going at it.  Yep are lesbians Nothing rings true in this Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do movie.  Clunky dialogue like I do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and did not take it does not help.  There is a wealthy, distant mother who disapproves of her daughters new relationship.  A sassy black maid  unbelievable that in the year 2003, a film gets made in which there is a sassy black maid.  Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave.  The woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids.  Sheesh!  No cliche is left unturned.",

		"German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible he is unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made.Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium.  This film is as shoddy and laughable as the bestworst of EW.  I watched it The answer is subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it.The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies.  Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face.The main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent.  Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA.  Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse, and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment.The sets are excruciatingly bad.  The production designers budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint Precinct 707 on a cardboard wall.Since the actors were obviously unpaid nonprofessionalsa sad assortment of European emigres possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands, bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middleaged womenand since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuinelooking police uniforms.  Sadly, they could not afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental.More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him.  One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he is the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies.  The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated.The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her.  Do not ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommels logic and enjoy the absurd ride.After much prolonged handclawing out of strawcovered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance.  They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor makeup generously airbrushed around their eyes.  Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Eurotrash techno into the soundtrack.  We are talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise.  Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.Unlike other zombies, Lommels girls speak and function as normal... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified.  This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog.  Yes, a golden shower it is.I will not spoil anything by revealing the shock ending.  All I can say is it is perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece.  The spirit of Ed Wood lives on... or should I say his geist.",

		"I cannot believe that this movie was ever created.  I makes it The zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup.  The zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes.  Finally, there are maybe five or six zombies total, definitely not a nation.  The best part of the movie, if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished.  Again to reiterate other user comments, the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie.  Also, there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all.  It is never explained.",
		"Seriously crappy movie.First off, the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehousefurniture store.  The bad cop takes a girl, which they had pulled over, into the warehouses attic, while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there.  The bad cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag, and the newbie cop does not think there are any problems, but he still wonders what was in the bag, so he asks, gets a bullshit response, and then he thinks everything is OK for now.The bad cop repeats this process, and even once with a tit scene made it slightly better.  But eventually people start to catch on, which took awhile considering how fing obvious it was.  One girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies, like ya do.  Now, the bad cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch, and then he gets rid of the duffelbagged body.Since she had the oogeyboogey magic put on her, she comes back with lots of eyeshadow on, which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie... also, the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become eyeshadow monsters.  Some of the girls meet up with a dude, who is apparently a currency specialist, and he offers them a ride they look normal to him apparently.  But when the girls see other people, such as the one girls husband, he freaks out because she is hideous some people freak out, but others do not even notice.... massive plot hole.So, to wrap it up, the eyeshadow monsters kill the bad cop, who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene.  It prep us Like anyone would want to see part 2 of this cow dropping.",

		" REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS  I will make this review short and sweet.  I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman.  How bad could it be, right?  Well, it is pretty bad.  Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at Edisons Police Force.  LL Cool J is Deed, a cop within the force on a special force team called F.R.A.T.  First Response Assault Tactics.  He named Lazerov In the opening scene we see Lazerov  Deed taking on some bank robbers, but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs.  I do not want to give to much away, but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs.  Pollack, who works for Ashford Morgan Freeman goes to a trial involving Deeds  Lazerov.  He suspect foul play and with the help of Ashford, does some investigate that turns ugly.  Wallace Kevin Spacey who is all within the F.R.A.T. team joins with Ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice.You can tell from the beginning that Freeman and Spaceys performance are pretty lackluster.  The only person that give a all out performance is Dylan McDermott.  He is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me.  LL Cool J is terrible in this film.  He says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion.  He was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea  Any Given Sunday.  The film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film.  The ending is far from satisfying.Do not waste your time with this film.  I am putting it on Ebay this weekend.",

I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman.  How bad could it be, right?  Well, it is pretty bad.  Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at Edisons Police Force.  LL Cool J is Deed, a cop within the force on a special force team called F.R.A.T.  First Response Assault Tactics.  He is teamed with an ontheedge bad cop named Lazerov Dylan McDermott.  In the opening scene we see Lazerov  Deed taking on some bank robbers, but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs.  I do not want to give to much away, but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs.  Pollack, who works for Ashford Morgan Freeman goes to a trial involving Deeds  Lazerov.  He suspect foul play and with the help of Ashford, does some investigate that turns ugly.  Wallace Kevin Spacey who is all within the F.R.A.T. team joins with Ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice.You can tell from the beginning that Freeman and Spaceys performance are pretty lackluster.  The only person that give a all out performance is Dylan McDermott.  He is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me.  LL Cool J is terrible in this film.  He says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion.  He was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea  Any Given Sunday.  The film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film.  The ending is far from satisfying.Do not waste your time with this film.  I putting it",
		"usually I support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant...i tend to support everybody, because their efforts are worth...but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits! imagine the following situation1. think about the REALLY WORST horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far.2. think about some great, attractive ART for that movies DVD box...and a promising plot...3. voil?!  you got ZOMBIE ANYTHING is better.",
		"Notice I have given this 1 star if the option been given I would have given this zero.  As I put this DVD into my TV and sat down on my couch I was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest.  I rated movie But it did not prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screen.The box makes this movie out to look well OK at best.  DO NOT LET THAT FOOL YOU.  This movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world.The best way I can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it.  The acting if you can call it that, the plot so many holes must look like Swiss cheese, and the special effects really are just terrible.Please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch.In the end I am not saying I can make a better movie than this, but I am thinking it.",

I love zombie I actually began to feel angry watching this film because it is so insultingly poor, I cannot believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable.There is no plot and the nonplot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking.  The people do not react, act or in any way resemble human beings.  The entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be.  The whole thing is one pointless mess, it does not go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and do not do very much.I could make a better film than this, so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before.  It is pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time.Honestly, the very worst movie of all time.  You will note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a 1010 and urge you to BUY the DVD.

		"Zombie Nation 2004 RHey, I was bored.  I looked in my Comcastic little box to find a movie to watch.  Zombie Nation?  Hey, I love zombie movies.  Says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description.  Funny how it does not warn me not to watch this film.  I could have used that advice.Zombie Nation is just like Troll 2 in that it is completely misnamed.  It takes place This film revolves around a crooked cop, who acts as badly as possible he has to be trying to suck this much, while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them.  Yup, he is a serial killer cop.  Not only is this film flawed in thinking that it is a zombie flick, it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong.  Serial killers enjoy killing, they live for it and they get down and personal with it.  This guy knocks out the women, and injects them with some poison.  He does not even have sex with the corpse or dismember it.  Talk about boring!  Eventually, one of the whopping five women he kills has Voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason, all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy.  They were all buried or tossed into the ocean, but you would not know it buy the sharp clean clothes they are all wearing.  The women then act very poorly and take their revenge.  Oh yay.This film was crap in every category.  Crap acting, crap writing, crappier sets, and crappier makeup effects.  The women do not look zombielike, unless you count really dark makeup around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie.  They can all talk, behave, think, and act perfectly human.  The gore is weak compared to even many PG13 films and the nudity is beyond brief.  You see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence...  Then the exact same breasts later!  Go figure.  Guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite.  The police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they are obviously filming in.  You can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse setup and even, unless you are blind, you can see the director failing.  Steer clear, it is a waste of time.110",

Man renting it I am a big fan of the George Romero movies and I am pretty sure that if he saw this movie, he would probably throw up while laughing too hard.  I mean, what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like Charlies Devils?  It really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer, especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shoppolice stationapartmentflatwhatever room it was with the gong in the background, and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop.  I could not even tell what nationality the killer was, and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations did not help either.  Oh well, what can I expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world.

		"German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible he is unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made.Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium.  This film is as shoddy and laughable as the bestworst of EW.  I watched it The answer is subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it.The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies.  Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face.The main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent.  Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA.  Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse, and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment.The sets are excruciatingly bad.  The production designers budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint Precinct 707 on a cardboard wall.Since the actors were obviously unpaid nonprofessionalsa sad assortment of European emigres possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands, bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middleaged womenand since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuinelooking police uniforms.  Sadly, they could not afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental.More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him.  One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he is the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies.  The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated.The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her.  Do not ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommels logic and enjoy the absurd ride.After much prolonged handclawing out of strawcovered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance.  They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor makeup generously airbrushed around their eyes.  Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Eurotrash techno into the soundtrack.  We are talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise.  Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.Unlike other zombies, Lommels girls speak and function as normal... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified.  This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog.  Yes, a golden shower it is.I will not spoil anything by revealing the shock ending.  All I can say is it is perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece.  The spirit of Ed Wood lives on... or should I say his geist.",

Do not ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommels logic and enjoy the absurd ride.After much prolonged handclawing out of strawcovered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance.  They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor makeup generously airbrushed around their eyes.  Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Eurotrash techno into the soundtrack.  We are talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise.  Stuff shake his This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog.  Yes, a golden shower it is.I will not spoil anything by revealing the shock ending.  All I can say is it is perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece.  The spirit of Ed Wood lives on... or should I say his geist.",
		"BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is, he loves his crap.I have never seen a Ulli Lommel film but I was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful.  Like the movies I said in the beginning do not even equal a six when added together!  After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy really is.  He is the worst out there.The credits would not end as the pathetic movie started and quickly I noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in.  The acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots.  The editing is easily the worst.  This movie made no sense and I unbearably could not take it anymore as it would not end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie.  I take it I wasted 45 minutes of my life.DO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP!",
		"I rented this movie last week.  I saw Kevin And it was, until Justin Timberlake came on scene.  He is a really bad actor and should not be allowed to make a movie ever again.  I mean, he is one of the most boring, uninspired actors I have ever seen.  He puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever.  Why the hell was he cast for the role of Josh Pollack?  I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice.Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment.  His character is so dull, it seems like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en.  It might sound cool, but believe me, it is not.Now, Dylan McDermotts acting is very good.  It is about one of the very few good things about this movie.  He is just inspired.Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special.  He has some really cool lines though.About the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good.  I was expecting a big twist when Lazerov Dylan McDermott was killed, but nothing really happened.",

The audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teens joking around making a fake fight scene.IF you are considering renting or buying this movie I would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show is how awful it truly is.

I have never seen a worse movie in my life, 5 minutes in I decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen...  It did not.  Aside from a nice breast shot The movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse, and the same warehouse was used for at least 90 of the sets.  You even see this same red chair in several different locations If you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment, not some warehouse which will echo all your actors dialog..  Note to producers Renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse, and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable If you spend your money to rent this people I hope you got it with a return guarantee...

However, if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably the most indefensibly abysmal film ever  this is for you.  Now, whenever anyone asks me what the worst film I have ever seen is, I will say Zombie Nation.Seriously  I think it is a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one, and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for producing a film that actually stuns you with its ineptitude.

		"I imagine when Hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together, the talk is not of the Masters great films like North By Northwest or Strangers On A Train, but a lesserknown effort like this one from 1931, obscure and seriously flawed, which showcases the great director in fledgling form.Emily and Fred Hill Joan Barry and Harry Kendall are a middleclass London couple scrimping to stay ahead.  He begrudges their lot; she accepts it.  Change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle, saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury.  They make plans for a world cruise.  But their problems have only begun.Just ask Richard Hannay, Roger O.  Thornhill, or Marion Crane.  Well, Marions indisposed at the moment, but you get the idea.  Travel and Hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight, setting one up for a perilous journey at best.  This is perhaps Hitchcocks earliest foray into this theme, and not his most successful or memorable.  Hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element, in this case domestic drama rather than suspense, but the two do not cohere, at least not here.The Hills are a dull, flat couple, with no chemistry or personality.  When they find themselves at the Folies Berg?re, in the form of crosscutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film, they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers.

In an interview, Johnny Duncan Robin said that in one scene he and Batman had to run from the car to the house and that Lowery was doubled over out of camera range because his girdle was too tight!  Duncan says something His cowl is so bad he cannot even see out of it and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the disgruntled easter rabbit than they do anything batlike.In one scene I am not making this up, Batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some hoods.  It is radioactive so he can trace it the reason it is so highly flammable is not explained.  Well, unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse we know it is a cardboard warehouse because Batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that look to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out and soon the whole place burns to the ground.  Thanks Batman! In another scene after the Batmobile is disabled, Batman flags down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to worry because if Batman smashes up the car the police will surely buy him another one!  Yes, you guessed it, said car careens off a cliff within a few short seconds.  Not that it matters much to the motorist who has probably died from exposure trying to hoof his way back to Gotham City.There is a tired subplot with Lois Lane clone Vicki Vale who is convinced Bruce Wayne is Batman she must have noticed the Batmobile parked outside of Bruces house or maybe she saw Batman and Robin running up the walk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood.Everything about this serial is bad and all but the youngest in the audience will want to hurl toast at the screen.  IF you are looking for bad cinema you could not hit a better mark if you want entertainment, try the Burton Batman films, the Adam West Batman TV Series or the earlier Lewis Wilson Batman serial.",

I was sold on the promise of action, with Segal and stealth aircraft, which normally make for an entertaining action movie.  I say I The acting was so awful that it was almost funny.  The story was insanely weak, with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an F117 through them.  The script was so poor, if I found out that a 10 year old wrote it I should not be in the least surprised.  The direction and production is so amateur, I would not even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video.  Utter Utter drivel.  Those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art, and they should be ashamed of themselves.  Steven Segal should never ever show his face in public again, I cannot imagine what made him agree to star in this, the worst film I have seen in my entire life.",

It also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent Steven Seagal has become.  This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again.It was released only on video I cannot imagine why and I suspect the workers that had to make the DVDs had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling.",
		"STAR RATING  Saturday Night  Friday Night  Friday Morning  Sunday Night  Monday Morning The American military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other.  A renegade pilot Steve Touissant steals it and plots to hold the US government to ransom with it.  So they are forced to send in their best man John Sands Seagal, who else?  to stop him, in exchange for his freedom from a detention centre where his mind was to be wiped of all the incriminating information he is learned over the years.I skipped Attack Force because I could tell from the cover and all the post production tampering that had occurred that it would be crap and when all the negative reviews and low user rating came pouring in it just confirmed what I thought.  But I decided to give FOF a go because Shadow Man by the same director was not bad and, what the hell, Seagal was my favourite action star once and maybe, just maybe, he could make a great film again.  Oh what a fool I was.Dubbing, horrendous stock footage of aerial stealth fighter jets, awful camera work, cheap production values, risible, unconvincing fight scenes that have become Seagals trademark and a boring, sleep inducing plot that does not go anywhere.Thankfully his next film, Once Upon a Time in the Hood which I will be skipping, apparently marks the end of his contract with Sony, meaning no more of these awful European lensed action films and his next film Prince of Pistols might mark a return to theatres.  Hell done it This is not a Flight of Fury.  It is not even a flight of fun.  It is a flight that fails to even take off the ground. ",

I honestly believe that more of Segals movies would do better if he was not the only one that fans recognize in the movie.  Supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing, and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses, maybe the movie will get more popular results.",
		"You have gotta hand it to Steven Seagal whatever his other faults may be, he does have good taste in women.  If you pick a Seagal movie, chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it.  And usually, they do not function as mere eye candy; they get involved in the action and fight, shoot guns, kill with knives, etc.  Flight finds time And if it seems like I am spending a little too much time talking about them, it is because the rest of the movie, although passable, is so unexciting that it is hard to find much else to talk about.  Ironically, the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself, who looks as if he cannot even be bothered to try to pretend to care.  This being a militarytype actioner, there is very little fighting in it, and he does not fit into his role a stealth fighter pilot, the best in the world, of course very well, which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking. 12",

Almost hilarious, and that is a shame for an action movie....  Definitely not worth watching.They keep replaying the same shots of an Stealth airplane flying away.  You getting worser",
		"Steven Seagal, Mr.  Personality himself, this time is the United States greatest Stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the military..who attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base, later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas stationif he is able to successfully infiltrate a Northern Afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called Black Sunday, who have commandeered an Air Force stealth fighter thanks to an American traitor.  Along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor, JannickMark Bazeley, John SandsSeagalwill fly into enemy territory, receiving help from his Arab lover, JessicaCiera Paytonand a freedom fighter, RojarAlki David once they are on ground.  Jannick is kidnapped by Black Sunday leaders, StoneVincenzo Nicoliand his female enforcer, ElianaKatie Jones, and Sands must figure out how to not only retake command of the kidnapped stealth fighter, but rescue him as well.  And, maybe, Sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained, RatherSteve Toussaintin the process.  Sands has 72 hours until a Generals Navy pilots bomb the entire area.  On board the stealth, Black Sunday equipped a biochemical bomb, hoping to detonate it on the United States.Seagal gets a chance to shoot Afghans when he is not slicing their throats with knives.  The film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead.  The setting of Afghanistan does not hold up to scrutiny..nor does how easily Seagal and co. are able to move about the area undetected so easily and the plot itself is nothing to write home about.  The movie is edited fast, the camera a bit too jerky.  Seagal seeing him One of Seagals poorest efforts, and he is as understated as ever..not a compliment.  Even more disappointing is the fact that Seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the films chief villains, tis a shame.  He does not even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible way..sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around, but it is not as clear a picture as I enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying closeups.",
		"Flight of Fury starts as General Tom Barnes Angus MacInnes organises an unofficial test flight of the X77, a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible.  General Barnes gives his top pilot Colonel Ratcher Steve Toussaint the job  everything goes well until the X77 disappears, even more literally than Barnes wanted as Ratcher flies it to Northern Afghanistan  delivers it to a terrorist group known as the Black Sunday lead by Peter Stone Vincenzo Nicoli who plans to use the X77 to fly into US airspace undetected  drop some bombs which will kills lots of people.  General Barnes is worried by the loss of his plane  sends in one man army John Sands cowriter  executive producer Steven Seagal to get it back  kill all the bad guys in the process...This American, British  Romanian coproduction was directed by Michael Keusch  was the third film in which he directed Seagal after the equally awful Shadow Man 2006  Attack Force 2007, luckily someone decided the partnership was not working  an unsuspecting public have thankfully been spared any further collaborations between the two.  Apparently Flight of Fury is an almost sceneforscene wordforword remake of Black Thunder 1988 starring Michael Dudikoff with many of the same characters even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although I must admit I have never seen Black Thunder  therefore cannot compare the two.  Flight of Fury is a terrible film, the poorly made  written waste of time that Seagal specialises in these days.  It are none The action scenes are lame  there is no real excitement in it, the villains are boring as are the heroes  it is right down there with the worst Seagal has made.Flight of Fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which is not even matched up that well, the background can change, peoples clothes change, the area changes, the sky  the quality of film changes very abruptly as it is all too obvious we are watching clips from other better films spliced in.  Hell, Seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this.  The action scenes consist of shootouts so badly edited it is hard to tell who is who  of course Seagal breaking peoples arms.  The whole production feels very cheap  shoddy.The IMDb reckons this had a budget of about 12,000,000 which I think is total rubbish, I mean if so where did all the money go?  Although set in Afghanistan which is a war torn arid desert Flight of Fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods, it was actually shot in Romania  the Romanian countryside does not make a convincing Afghanistan.  The acting is terrible as one would expect  Seagal looks dubbed again.Flight of Fury is a terrible action film that is boring, amateurish  is an almost sceneforscene remake of another film anyway.  Another really lazy  poorly produced action thriller from Seagal, why do I even bother any more?",

		"Following the appalling Attack Force, chances were that Seagal could only have a step up with Flight Of Fury.  To outstink Attack Force would take some doing.  Flight Of Fury is a marked improvement overall, but still in the grand scheme of thinks, mediocre.  Mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for Seagal these days, a sad insight into his movie careers decline.  Where Attack Force was a hodgepodge of plot lines altered drastically from conception, to filming, to post production, Flight Of Fury keeps the plot line more simple.  Someone use it Seagal has to get the plane back.  It is that simple, no annoying subplots, and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works.  That is not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though, it is pretty poor.  The introduction to side characters is badly done for example.In filmic terms FOF is bad.  It is badly acted by all involved, and Seagal looks bored to tears almost.  He is just got the look of a toddler who is been forced to perform the school nativity against his will, and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness.  Can we blame Seagal though when the material is so unambitious and cruddy?  Not really.  This is the final film of his Castel Studios, multipicture deal.  The producers cannot be bothered to make anything remotely good, promising a 12 or so million dollar budget, and after Seagals obligatory 5 million probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves If the film was made for the remaining 7 million, then I am Elvis Pressley!.  So in that respect why should Seagal put the effort into a film that is already got distribution sorted before it is made.  Fans though may argue, he at least owes them the effort.  He is seriously looking jaded, and the continued use of stand ins and dubovers is further indication of this.  Michael Keusch directs with some efficiency, while the cinematography is quite good, but in all technical areas and as usual with Castel, a bog standard stunt team there is nothing more than mediocrity, and nothing to help the film rise above its material, and bored leading man.  Again there is a few action scenes focusing on characters other than Seagal, which in all truth we do not want to see.Overall the action is not too bad.  It is nice and violent, and on occasion we are treated to a few vintage nasty Seagal beatings, but overall nothing special.  Partly due to a poor stunt crew, and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting.  For me, Shadow Man was a more enjoyable film, because while ignoring the incoherent, jumbled, plot line, there were more vintage Seagal moments, and more of him in centre stage.  He never disappeared for long periods during the film.  Seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here, and reappears after, with little explanation.  There is far too much stock footage used.  Using stock shots is not an entirely horrendous thing, but using it as a crutch is.  We are treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships, all the time, which get annoying.  Plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place just check the backdrops, chopping and changing.The film is just middle of the road.  It says it all that the films best scene is a completely needless, and gratuitous girl on girl scene, with two hot chicks.  Seagal even perks up briefly then too!  Overall this may be one of the better stock footage based actioners out there, but that is not saying much at all.  This will please many fans, but they should bear in mind, Seagal himself would probably want to forget this ones existence. ",

		"I cannot believe that Steven Segals career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors.  I see him When he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong.The plot is unbelievable as a movie, and even if you excuse the visuals, and had read this story as a novel, you would be left wondering why you had even picked up the book.Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation.  He shows no effort and no enthusiasm, and in some scenes he does not show up at all.I hate to repeat other peoples comments, but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic.  The condition of those scenes chopped in, is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time.  The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner.My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie, it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds.  I read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget Segal being paid 5 of that and that the movie still came in under budget.  I must concur.It is no wonder that this is a direct to DVD movie, as no conscientious theatre owner would play this movie .",

It was the birthplace of the dean of American letters; it was where a young reporter named Samuel Clemens began using the name Mark Twain and went on to become Americas most famous writer.  It was also the birthplace of the great Hearst fortune, and the launching pad of John Mackay, who became the wealthiest man in America, the third wealthiest man in the world.  Hey, they should have made the movie about him!  In the 1860s Virginia CIty was THE boomtown of all boomtowns, the home of the big bonanza, at one time the largest metropolitan area west of St.  Louis and East of San Francisco.  But Virginia City the movie misses all that and is more about a hogwash NorthSouth duello between the characters played by Errol Flynn and Randolph Scott.  Flynn is Capt.  Kerry Bradford, a Union officer who is a POW in a concentration camp run by a mean Confederate commander named Capt.  Vance Irby, played by Scott.  These two are always getting in each others way.  Bradford escapes and then tries to stop a shipment of gold bullion being snuck out of VC by who else other than . . .  Irby!  Hey, what is he doing here!?  Horrible.  Bogart is side Miriam Hopkins plays a murky character named Julia Hayne, obviously a historical lunge at the towns first lady, Julia Bulette, who in real life a celebrated prostitute.  She goes to Washington and talks Honest Abe about saving BRADFORD not Irby from hanging and blah blah blah.  Go figure.  They shoulda hung the writer.  In real life Twain reports that on the last day of the War, the setting sun caused the American flag atop Mt.  Davidson to appear to the puzzled residents to be weirdly on fire, kind of like the movie.  Three days later they discovered that on that day the South capitulated.  One interesting quirk in the film is how sidekicks Alan Hale and Guin Williams flick their pistols forward when they shoot, like they are fishing, or trying to make the bullets go faster.  Not a bad idea for the movie.  The same kind of goofiness is lathered over sap and corn throughout the movie.  Gosh, how could they miss the gold madness, profligate wealth, gun battles in the silver mines, Mark Twain getting run out of town and beat up after a showdown, the crooked railroad, the Opera House fire, Artemis Ward, Bulettes huge funeral, the Chinese tongs, the black saloons, the Auction . . ?  All this high on a mountain surrounded by desert?  The truth was unreal.  Did its fabulous wealth actually spark the great American holocaust?  Well, if you count this movie, it would not be the first debacle to come out of Virginia City.  It is a disappointment for Virginia City fans because it misses what made the town a city of illusions, where it is said evil seeps out of the ground . . .  Okay, other than that it is a fun movie.  Flynn and the gang are always great no matter what history they are destroying.  If Flynn would just play his rotten self I would double my rating.",

		"SLASHERS make it The movie is ostensibly an episode of a live Japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off danger zone and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them.  The survivor, if there is one, wins fame and fortune... everyone else just winds up dead.  The main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad.  None of the real people seem real at all.  The actors playing the killers are kind of fun... because they are portraying cheesy and overthetop caricatures of popular modern horror movie types... and that is exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show.  The movie pretends to be done all in one take... there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the danger zone and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera... but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly to hide the cuts from one take to another, I would imagine.",
		"I have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film.  One thing I see, over and over, is annoyance with Megan, the idealistic political scientist, trying to change the world.  I loved her Maybe, because I am a 23 year old political science student and I think I am going to change the world too, so I relate to Megan.  Besides, she is cute.  She is no super model, but more of a cute girl next door.OK, so she cried and screamed a lot.  It is very dramatic, and seems overdone, but does not it fit her character?  She goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point.  She thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick.  I think she made her argument very well.  Of course, being a young naive girl, she is terrified of what she is about to face.  I think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear.  Furthermore, I think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in.As for the movie in general, other than Megan, it was pretty much what I expected.  It had excellent gore scenes, by microbudget standards.  The plot maybe took a quick thought, hardly any contemplation.  It is basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film, which the name implies.  I love the sadism of the doctor.  He kept ripping Megans shirt off, not just for the cause of sleaze though largely so, but also to torment her, before he kills her.  The Chainsaw hick was hilarious.  For slasher film lovers, he was probably the best character.I give this film 4 out of 10.  It had a good setting, almost no plot, and a mix of good and terrible acting.  I would recommend it for a cheap thrill, but hardly a diamond in the rough that is microbudget horror.",

The acting is like Elist and it is shown well in the movie.  Not to mention it is so low budget that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are played by the same person.  The whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film.  The only other reason I liked the movie was because Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny.  They said many stupid things that made me laugh.  Other than that if you see this movie at Blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind Lawnmowerman 2.

Now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days,For example when i watched it i thought to my self i wouldnt mind having a go at this game!  especially for 12.000.000. so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind.",
		"i could not help but think of behind the mask the rise of leslie vernon a massively more amazing film when watching this because of the realistic feel to it as well as the great innovative idea. this could have been a GREAT film. the acting is...from some of the actors alright. from others...it is downright horrible.that aside the idea is great and the format is great. the story is pretty good as well, though suffering often from big blows to the logical mind.nevermind that though right?  it want it",

That damn muscular vibrato can shatter Soviet tanks into tiny bits, nevermind glass.Why did not you switch the channel if you did not like it? , you might ask angrily.  Fair point, fair point...  The answer is that I wanted to, but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that I fell to the floor, writhing in agony.  With my last ounces of energy, I tried to reach the remote but could not.A silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by Niven, who then proceeds to pigmalionize him.  Lanza is in love with asymmetrical Grayson, but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up.  This may seem like a rather thin plot, but this noisy movie is so chockfull of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all.  This movie is RELENTLESS.  Forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with Slayers Reign In Blood as in a South Park episode.  Whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange 50s musical world, it is all infantile  as if they were all 6 yearolds impersonating grownups.  I can only envy people who find movies like this funny.  It must be great being easytoplease what a world of wonder would open up to me if only I could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious, gutbusting comedy.  But let us examine this phenomenon, the 50s musical.  My best guess is that 50s musicals offered the more daydreaming idealists among us a glimpse into Utopia or Heaven depending on whether you are churchgoing or Leninstombgoing, or at least very cheesy version of these fantasyinspired places.  TTONO is more akin to a representation of Hell, but that is just me.  I do not seem to get musicals.  People talk, there is a story  but then allofasudden everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened!  When you think about it, musicals are stranger than any sciencefiction film.Worse yet, TTONO my favourite type of pizza, btw is not just a 50s musical, but one with opera squealing.  Opera is proof that there is such a thing as overtraining a voice  to the point where it becomes an earpiercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure.  The clearest example of this travesty is when Lanza and Grayson unite their Dark Side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet.  I tried lowering the volume.  I lowered it from 18 to 14.  Then from 14 to 10.  Then 8.  I ended up lowering it to a 1, which is usually so low that it is only heard by speciallytrained dogs and certain types of marsupials, and yet I STILL could hear those two braying like donkeys! Take the scene in the small boat in the river.  Danza starts off with one of his deafening, brainkilling tunes, and then... nothing.  No animals anywhere to be seen.  Even the crocodiles, who are mostly deaf, have all but left.  If you look carefully, you might even see the trees change colour, from green to yellow, in a matter of minutes.  No, this was not a continuity error, it was plain old torture of the flora.  And those trees were just matte paintings!  Imagine how real trees would have reacted.The reason glass breaks when a high C is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency, but because glass is only human  hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous selfexplosion.

With my last ounces of energy, I tried to reach the remote but could not.A silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by Niven, who then proceeds to pigmalionize him.  Lanza is in love with asymmetrical Grayson, but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up.  This may seem like a rather thin plot, but this noisy movie is so chockfull of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all.  This movie is RELENTLESS.  Forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with Slayers Reign In Blood as in a South Park episode.  Whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange 50s musical world, it is all infantile  as if they were all 6 yearolds impersonating grownups.  I can only envy people who find movies like this funny.  It must be great being easytoplease what a world of wonder would open up to me if only I could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious, gutbusting comedy.  But let us examine this phenomenon, the 50s musical.  My best guess is that 50s musicals offered the more daydreaming idealists among us a glimpse into Utopia or Heaven depending on whether you are churchgoing or Leninstombgoing, or at least very cheesy version of these fantasyinspired places.  TTONO is more akin to a representation of Hell, but that is just me.  I do not seem to get musicals.  People talk, there is a story  but then allofasudden everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened!  When you think about it, musicals are stranger than any sciencefiction film.Worse yet, TTONO my favourite type of pizza, btw is not just a 50s musical, but one with opera squealing.  Opera is proof that there is such a thing as overtraining a voice  to the point where it becomes an earpiercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure.  The clearest example of this travesty is when Lanza and Grayson unite their Dark Side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet.  I tried lowering the volume.  I lowered it from 18 to 14.  Then from 14 to 10.  Then 8.  I ended up lowering it to a 1, which is usually so low that it is only heard by speciallytrained dogs and certain types of marsupials, and yet I STILL could hear those two braying like donkeys! Take the scene in the small boat in the river.  Danza starts off with one of his deafening, brainkilling tunes, and then... nothing.  No animals anywhere to be seen.  Even the crocodiles, who are mostly deaf, have all but left.  If you look carefully, you might even see the trees change colour, from green to yellow, in a matter of minutes.  No, this was not a continuity error, it was plain old torture of the flora.  And those trees were just matte paintings!  Imagine how real trees would have reacted.The reason glass breaks when a high C is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency, but because glass is only human  hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous selfexplosion.

		"I has people This town is dull and so is this film.  There were a few decent scened in the movie but I was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show.  This movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there was not any.  Unless you are from Parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday, then stay away from this movie.  The dialog will put you to sleep, the acting will bore you to tears and Steven Soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this.  Its a predictable movie with no surprises.  What you see is what you get and that is a 73 minute tour of Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a narrator.",

		"The championship game is only a couple of days away, but things in New Orleans are not as they should be.  From players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose, life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable, wonderful time.  Can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined?  Despite what you might think when you first read about Superdome, this is not a football movie.  In fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought.  Instead, Superdome is another of those lousy soap operaish 70s madeforTV movies populated with Hollywood has beens and those that never will be.  The cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good.  The best or worst example is Van Johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he is there.  The plot is dull, uninteresting, and unbelievable.  Donna Mills as a hitman?  Yeah, right!  It soaked David The movie also lacks any pace.  Trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow Superdome might have had.  With no drama or suspense in sight, Superdome ends up being a very poor example of a 70s madeforTV movie.  The lone highlight for me was the voiceover work from the late Charlie Jones  a sportscaster I miss listening to.  The eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and overhypes the atmosphere in New Orleans is pure cheese at its finest.Like most others who have seen Superdome, I also did so courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000.  It may be one of the KTMA public access episodes, but it is one of the best examples of the shows early start.  So even though I have only rated Superdome a 210, I will give this episode a generous 35 on my MST3K rating scale.",

The filmmakers hoped to elicit some smiles from us but basically made me groan.The characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially astute for teenagers.  Almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the darn movie.  Very little of what the characters said were believable.  Combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail.

Rather than take the time to demonstrate what made Berkeley unique, we just hear this brat whine about not going there.Cannot even remember the black kids name.

Look how we are introduced to the football hero, Randall Floyd.  We see him In fact, we never see him play football.  We are introduced to him in class, inviting his nerdish poker buddies to a party.In Dazed feminism is not a casual byproduct of some chick getting knocked up.  It is much more organic, more serious than that.  It is refined in the ladies room over a flip discussion about Gilligans Island.  Serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings.

		"MAJOR LEAGUE BACK TO THE MINORS 1998 ½ Starring Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Daggett, Written and directed by John Warren 100 minutes Rated PG13 for language and some violence By Blake French \tBelieve it or not, in the new John Warren comedy MAJOR LEAGUE BACK TO THE MINORS there is one funny scene.  It have it It is not much, but with the exception of a few oneliners, it is all this film has to offer...enough said.  This movie is not only structurally impaired, characteristically undeveloped, predictable and badly written, but also just plain bad.  Even noncritical audience members will hate this movie with all that they got.  It is so familiar it just is not funny.  How many times does the same movie about sports have to be made?  Last years we saw this same material in Air Bud Golden Receiver, and as bad as that film was, this is even worse.  At least Air Bud was family oriented.  Major League Back to the Minors is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a Sunday afternoon.  It is too childish for adults.  So who is this film for?  Teenagers?  Elderly?  People who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this?\t The film, like many others like this, has one basic point it tries to make teamwork conquers all.

		"MAJOR LEAGUE BACK TO THE MINORS 1998 ½ Starring Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Daggett, Written and directed by John Warren 100 minutes Rated PG13 for language and some violence By Blake French \tBelieve it or not, in the new John Warren comedy MAJOR LEAGUE BACK TO THE MINORS there is one funny scene.  It consists of a sequence where an infuriated coach throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him only to have it hit the cement and bounce back and smash him in the face.  It is not much, but with the exception of a few oneliners, it is all this film has to offer...enough said.

Last years we saw this same material in Air Bud Golden Receiver, and as bad as that film was, this is even worse.  At least Air Bud was family oriented.  Major League Back to the Minors is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a Sunday afternoon.  It is too childish for adults.  So who is this film for?  Teenagers?  Elderly?

Coach Backula brilliantly moves him to first citing the fact that when he attempts to run he stays in the same place for too long a period of time.  Backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy in the end of the film, SPOILER, he tells his star player downtown to hit a home run, clearly downtown viewed this as a good move.  He hit the home run and won the game for his team, a minor league squad playing the Twins who were the class of the majors in the movie.  Now if only Tony Muser, manager of the Royals, would be as smart a coach as Backula and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat, the Royals would never end an inning let alone lose a game.",

It started out good but became so boring after the first half hour. spoilerIt tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants.  The only problem is that her daughters friend is the girl in the way.  She eliminating her After talking to a hitman, the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit.

If all that these directors want is a foot inside Hollywoods door then they are doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how Hollywood makes films.

		"Where is Michael Caine when you need him?  I have seen most of the many seasons of MST3K, but this rare pre1st season flick episdoe K20 is easily one of the worst movies ever made.  Three stars, Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever, delivering lines which must have been written by a secret Dick Cheneystyle workgroup composed of Exxon and GM lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research.  Looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness, possibly on Super 8.  Makes Logans Run look like the cinematic Sistine Chapel crossed with Shakespeare.  I watching it Clearly what is needed in Hollywood is some sort of 401K which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care.  With its rights to pollute and drive theme, by the end, I am half expecting to see a Charlton Heston cameo where he delivers his cold dead hands speech.  Lee, I could have forgiven you for this in 1989, but 1981?",

Kevin Spacey is almost always enjoyable as well you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery, and Freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars out of ten...he is not THAT good.When all is said and done, the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudoaction poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake.  It also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters.  All in all, ts just plain boring.  That being said, rent this when you are suffering from insomnia.",

For another, his concealing of one important information the Hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film.  That is, goitre, a sickness caused by lack of iodine salt.  This goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had Bunuel only took the time to make his research heck, if he checked cretinism in a medical dictionary he would have found goitre he MIGHT have ended up telling the truth about these people still, doubtfully.  Instead, with his film, he judges them constantly, talking about them as cretins, again and again, dramatizing the action, settingup scenes to create the spectacle, all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an allmighty objectivity.  Bunuel talks all the time in this film, not letting one word to the people he is filming.

I was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie  why the hell did I watch this movie.Of course I was not expecting much from Justin as he really does not belong in the movietheater business.  But Morgan and Kevin?  I could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in Edison.  To be honest, their roles are rather stupid.Well you might think if the players suck, then I should pay more attention to the story.  It is indeed story is the core of a movie, but guys... trust me... this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story.  Imagine this, a smartass journalist Justin Timberlake wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a real journalist from his boss Morgan Freeman.  This all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice LL Cool J and an brilliant investigator Kevin Spacey.  At the end, they beat the system with a happy ending story.Jeez, I could not even carry on with this.  Just recalling the movie is making me sick already.  My advise guys, do not watch this!

		"Murder is madeforTV Considering the only actor of any note is Bullock although Michael Pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things, it is not a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things.  Like... remembering to lock your front door when you go out.  Or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower.Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, a cop with personal issues do not they all.  Together with her new partner a wetlooking Ben Chaplin, she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman.  Nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they have planned and executed the perfect murder.  As the investigation continues, a battle of wills emerges between Cassie and the main suspect Richie Haywood Ryan Gosling.The crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless.  Bullock, though she is very nice to look at, is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as Rodney Dangerfield actually, he would be better!.  Chaplin, for his sins, is a complete nonentity and I feel sorry that he has to put this film on his CV in his attempt to break into Hollywood.  At least Gosling and Pitt, as the conniving sneering suspects, acquit themselves adequately.  As if dodgy leads were not bad enough, a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable but illogical ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run.Murder By Numbers has absolutely nothing going for it, even a pointless nude scene by Bullock would not redeem it.  Well, just a little but still not enough to save it.  Forgettable, predictable and redundant  this is one film that is not going to move the cop genre forward.  As Cassie probably says on her next case, there is nothing to see here people.  Move along, keep moving...",
		"From director Barbet Schroder Reversal of Fortune, I think I saw a bit of this in my Media Studies class, and I recognised the leading actress, so I tried it, despite the rating by the critics.  Basically cool kid Richard Haywood Half Nelsons Ryan Gosling and Justin Pendleton Bullys Michael Pitt team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them.  Investigating the murder is homicide detective Cassie The Hyena Mayweather Sandra Bullock with new partner Sam Kennedy Ben Chaplin, who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene, e.g. nonrelating hairs.  The plan does not seem to be completely going well because Cassie and Sam do quite quickly have Richard or Justin as suspects, it is just a question of if they can sway them away.  Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D.  Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst.  D.A.  Al Swanson.  I save it Adequate!",

		"Hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once did the majestic and very funny Maitresse 1976, and now only seems to do by the numbers Hollywood thrillers.This is very lightweight John Grisham material, crossed with the plot of a TV movie.  Bullock is Cass Ben Chaplin is her reserved police partner Sam Kennedy, and together they make an uncomfortable duo.  Not good, when two unbalanced college maladriots Gosling and Pitt decide to send them on a wild goose chase  by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene.Fair enough, but while Bullock and Chaplin fail to create any sparks, we also have to endure a several dull overlymelodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in Casss history.  Then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliffside log cabin where there is absolutely no doubt the OTT ending will be set.  Oooh... the atmosphere.Watch any episode of CSI instead.  It is to the point and far more exciting.",
		"They must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the Hollywood bus station.  They set their You know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot, four young boys playing in grainy slow motion, accompanied by voice over narration.  Next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion.  Once they are grown, it is easy to spot the writerdirector among the four.  He is the quiet, contemplative, longhaired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants.  This means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from Hickville to Hollywood.  Only there is no writing, or directing talent on display here.  And if you still cannot figure out which one he is, heres a hint The auteur and his character have the same middle name.  It took over an hour to figure out that these twentysomething men were supposed to still be in high school.  What looked like a prison was apparently a high school, the warden turned out to be the principal.  Once more, the poor, misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement, murder and pillage, but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father.  How about hitting back, kid, like you do everyone else?  Numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose.  Howlingly bad dialogue.  Many scenes badly out of focus.  Cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras, drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience.  Overacting in the extreme.  And if you do not quite get the selfimportant speeches, or the slowmotion scenes, just listen to the overbearing music.  It will clue you in and what you are supposed to feel.  Poor Marisa Ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films.  The biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies, run over puppies chained to a tree, rob and steal, all the while complaining about their sad, sorry lives.  But if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college.  Yeah, that is the ticket.  Why is it that every twentysomething filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important, so interesting, that the world cannot wait to see it onscreen?  If this movie is as autobiographical as it seems, then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants.",

		"Spoilers containedI would heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific.  What I did not expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go.  What starts off as a typical cowboyindian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic comedy about Honus Soldier Blue of the title played by Peter Strauss and Cresta Candice Bergen who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the Cheyenne.  The majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit.  Donald Pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason.  They then escape and both turn up separately at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base.  As Cresta used to be married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them.  So far so ordinary.  Then comes the ending.  After enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will theywill not they get together storyline, the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head.  Similarities can be drawn with the Wild Bunch at this point of the film but the Wild Bunch kept the same tone throughout and did not resort to extreme gratuitous violence.  In some ways, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perrys Last Summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending.  I found it If you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents, I would recommend Elem Klimovs Come and See.",

		"First of all, this film can be divided into three segments.  A promising opening, with the ambushing of some cavalry by the Cheyenne.  This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section, with the totally miscast Candice Bergen and Soldier Blue traveling together to reach the safety of an Army garrison.  Miss Bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth, and looks like she just walked out of a 1970s Jack Nicholson movie.  I mean she The third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an Indian village.  This is so obviously overdone to lay on the antiwar propaganda, that it comes across as simply long, outrageous, and contrived.  Not recommended.   MERK................................

		"When Sam Peckinpahs superlative THE WILD BUNCH 1969 opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultraviolence, it did so with a talented if whiskymarinated hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth, but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by Peckinpahs epic, and SOLDIER BLUE definitely falls into that category.SOLDIER BLEW, er, BLUE tells the story of foulmouthed New Yorker Cresta Lee Candice Bergen a blonde protohippie chick who is been rescued from two years of captivity among the Cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she will be reunited with the fianc?e she only wants to marry for his money.  Also on board the wagon she is traveling in is a shipment of government gold, cash the Cheyenne need to buy guns with, so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and Cresta flees to the hills, accompanied by Honus Gant Peter Strauss, the lone surviving cavalryman.  Calling Gant by the snarky nickname Soldier Blue, Cresta demonstrates that her years among the savages was time well spent, outstripping Gant in survival skills, common sense, and sheer balls, and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements, a band of hostile Kiowa, an unscrupulous trader  played by Donald Pleasance, here giving one of his most ridiculous performances, and that is saying something  and, in the tradition of many previous westernset romantic comedies, each other.During the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably  and predictably  attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on  while Gant has a freshly treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg, no less  in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that was not filled with rattlesnakes, mountain lions, or who knows what, to say nothing of the Cheyenne, who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment there I go, thinking in NYC real estate terms again.  Realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave, Cresta leaves Gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge will not spare a couple of men so they can rescue Gant; the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby Cheyenne village, and once Cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubbytobe and makes a beeline straight to the Cheyenne to warn them of what is coming.  What happens next is what gained the film its infamy; it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a leadin to a hideous reenactment of the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre, an orgy of rape, torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of keeping the country clean, and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty.  Children charging horses No joke, this scene would instantly garner an NC17 rating if released today, to say nothing of possibly spurring Native American interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted.I am all in favor of westerns that do not shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won, or stolen if truth be told, but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be; one minute it is a heavyhanded pseudohippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up well, DUH! , then it is a lighthearted battle of the sexes farce wherein Cresta proves herself five times the man Gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho with no undies, but that all goes out the window when Donald Pleasance shows up with an unintentionally ?  hilarious pair of bucktoothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a subplot that goes nowhere, all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax.  Any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film, but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the films promotion and poster imagery.  But by trying to be all things to all audiences, SOLDIER BLUE ends up as an incoherent, preachy Mulligan stew of presumably wellintentioned political correctness, but if they were going to tell the story of the Sand Creek Massacre, would not it have been a good idea to have some Indian characters who were more than just walkons with Murphy Brown acting as their mouthpiece?  We get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing the most savage film in history.  If you, like me, were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its daring to tell it like it was, take my word for it and let SOLDIER BLUE slowly fade into cinematic obscurity.",

The first was Charles Laughtons Rembrandt.  It shut it This one I am afraid is not very much better.Flora Robson is as ugly as ever as Queen Elizabeth.  Perhaps, her performance as the virgin Queen was good for 1937 standards but when you compare it to that of a Helen Mirren, it is absolutely no match.  In robotic fashion, Robson states her lines.  Her battle message to the English troops is so lackluster in spirit.Even a dashing Laurence Olivier cannot save this utter piece of boredom.Future wife Vivien Leigh is in a supporting role here and she does not really convey anything here.  To think, that Scarlett was 2 years later! It is a shame that history with the Spanish Armada is made out to be so boring in this film.",

Even the end is exactly the same the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand.  The world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it.Delon is not killing so many people like the Ghost dog.  But I guess Jarmusch liked Leon very much or even Desperado by Rodriguez.  So he added this, too.  And let me guess the girl will become a professional like Ghost dog like Natalie Portman in Leon? So what was Jarmusch thinking after all?  Where is the unique, the original thought in this movie? I making carbon",

However, the story is fatuous, unacurate and misleading.  It is also offensive.I am a quarter Cree Indian, and for some reason I feel insulted, on a personal level, by the nature of Whitakers character.  First of all, he is a black guy.  And this is not a racist remark, I swear.  The thought of a White, Hispanic or even Native American swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents.  The katana represents the soul of a Samurai, imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the Samurai.  For Ghost Dog to use his guns instead of the Katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside, and where the heck did he get a Katana anyway?  It must be one of those replicas, which insults the Samurai caste even more.Also, Ghost Dog showed no honor.  Near the end of the movie, he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain.  Not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy, it is more like a ninjas way; silent assassins; a group that samurais deny exists, but hates nonetheless.Then he tries to kill his boss, when he finds out his boss is a baddie.  You learns his He kills himself, to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master.Everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all Samurai adhere to Bushido.So, we have great cinematography, good ambiance and soso acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise, which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it , making it an unsatisfactory overall film, and an insult to everything a honorable bushisamurai holds dear. 2.510 Bleah",

		"This is a wellworn story about a man who marries to escape the hangmans noose, then sets about taming his reluctant bride.  It manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time.  We never find out, for example, why a woman who won the respect of an Indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband.  Or why the members of her team are so eager to get a real man in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own.  This only made sense in fifties Hollywood.There is a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whipthe second timethen yanks her off her horse.  Never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye, which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip!  Then, he prevails in a fight against her Indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp.  That is some second wind.  Later, he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty Indians as they all are in these flicks after they reject her now she is his squaw.  Never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and she is been negotiating with them for years.  And the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on himyeah, right.  Like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail.Finally, neither of the leads is convincing in their roles.  Madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky.  Fleming flips her The only reason you would root for her is because you want to see Madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the films end.  The way that Madison tames Fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blowup dolls.  Even if you do see them as dolls, the total lack of suspense will bore you.Total waste of time.  Even the scenerys kinda dull.  Give this one a big miss.",

Sadly it does not, and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you cannot help shouting out that you have been cheated into watching a pretty bad film, nobody in the cast come out with any credit, with lead man Guy Madison painfully wooden in the extreme.Not even the lovely Rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone, 310",

The almighty and abovethelaw organization is called FRAT and guess what?  they name it FRAT cops are corrupt and greedy, so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented !!!  journalist.

		"I love all types of films, especially horror.  That being said, Survival does not live up to ANY of the hype surrounding it.I cannot give it any points on originality.  There is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes, or remaking what others have done.  It take us On those lines I have to compare it with the likes of Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn though the twist in that one is obvious, and others.  Survival falls up way short against comparable films.  The plot was just not original in ANY way.  Some films can get by with a weak and way overdone plot with superb acting, special fx, or a slew of other factors.  Survivial does not have any of that to bank on.  If you will, note the following The acting in the movie never took off.  I do not knock or blame the actors for that, nor the director.  The dialogue was at best mediocre, and the actors involved never showed not saying did not HAVE the talent to pull it off.  I mention 2 standouts.  The leading man in this film certainly has the look, but I seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film.  The actor who portrayed Greg also had potential, but we never got to see any of it watch the movie to see why, you will not believe it...The grainy film look.  Ah yes, that little tidbit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of Grindhouse films.  In todays film making, that has become a gimmick.  It either works or it does not.  In this case it just does not work.  There are too many other flaws going on, so it winds up distracting from the film, not adding to it.  That being said, I think they did a good job of adding that grain.  That is some good, quality grain.  I think with a different script, better direction, and possibly actors, they should try another Grindhouse attempt.  They will probably pull it off.As far as the tech aspects, in my opinion, they never quite gelled for me either.  Better care could have been taken with audio sounds like it was fed directly into the camera, but there is nothing wrong with that and for being shot on DV, it was too soft for my taste.That is all I have to say about that.....",
		"I love all types of films, especially horror.  That being said, Survival does not live up to ANY of the hype surrounding it.I cannot give it any points on originality.  There is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes, or remaking what others have done.  It has just become a cop out for indie films to take us on a slasher journey through the woods, a crazed killer, and as of lately, throw in some crazy family.  On those lines I have to compare it with the likes of Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn though the twist in that one is obvious, and others.  Survival falls up way short against comparable films.  The plot was just not original in ANY way.  Some films can get by with a weak and way overdone plot with superb acting, special fx, or a slew of other factors.  Survivial does not have any of that to bank on.  If you will, note the following The acting in the movie never took off.  I do not knock or blame the actors for that, nor the director.

		"This movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together.  Well there is nothing wrong with that, except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together. 90 percent of the cast are white males about same age.  It is almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves.  The movie has no plot.  It simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath.  There are some funny scenes and comedic bits.  But they do not redeem the flat monotony.The graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do, and not done very well at that.  Anything makes it Well, the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get.  Ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane, inane comedy.  It works at times, but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over.  It is more like a string of Satuday Night Live skits than a movie.  It is a hityouovertheheadwithit kind of comedy.  I can see where the story idea is intriguing.  But, in this film post apocalyptic America is much like Medevil England.  In fact Wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era.  He plans to make a Part 2.  I guess he thinks he is Tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing.At the opening in LA, Wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2.  He was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one, to which he replied, well yea, sure.",

The organization to which I belong Les Clefs dOr has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. 3 Similarly untrue was the concept, at the end of the movie, of Doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them.  There is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization.This film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary.

		"End of the World is an uneventful movie, which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth.  The main character is some kind of scientist, I am not exactly sure what kind.  He has two jobs at a government?  facility guarded by four security men.  His first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job 2.  Job 2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room...at least that is the best I can figure.  Apparently the plant is not exactly topsecret, as the scientist brings his wife there.  She hangs out they are on their way to a dinner while he discovers a message from space Major Earth Disruption, repeated over and over.  He says something So they leave and go to the party !?!.  Moments later he finds out that China has suffered a major earthquake.  From there, the movie goes... nowhere!  Yes, Christopher Lee is in it, but that really does not help much.  Besides, Lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in Howling II.  This movie is boring, but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like Christopher Lee or Zgrade scifi.  Plus, there is lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed.",

		"It is got Christopher Lee, it is got huge banks of 1970s computers that make Teletype noises as letters appear on the screen, it is got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises, it is got volcanoes!  evil aliens disguised as nuns!  tidal waves!  earthquakes!  exploding cars!  exploding coffee machines!  and as a climax the entire planet blows up.  How on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly, mindnumbingly DULL?  The answer, my friend is because 90 of this movie is made up of establishing shots, most of them involving long tracks, pans, or zooms in combinations, or occasionally all three, that do nothing except give the crew something to do.  There are endless shots of our protagonists driving, getting in and out of cars, driving again, walking around looking at stuff, getting in cars and driving...  I just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering Say something, please somebody, just say something...  DO something... anything!... The dialogue, when it does come, is terrible.Maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours. was a typically meaningless line.  The script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage, justified in this speech from Lee as the head alienThe planet Earth has emitted an overabundance of diseases, they are contaminating the Universe.  All the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed!  This is is Neanderthal SF script writing.  This is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of 1950s Japanese monster suit movies aimed at 7 year olds.  It is, and I collect such things, the most godawful line from an English language SF movie since Buster Crabbe retired.

		"This film had a great cast going for it Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres  solid bmovie actors all.  But this downer of a movie did not use any of them to any sort of advantage, with none of their characters even meeting on screen though Christopher Lee does get to play opposite himself in several scenes.The motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change at the drop of a hat.  First, they just want to repair their ship and leave, then they turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets them the crucial part they need.  Then, out of nowhere, this peaceful race decides they have to destroy the planet because it causes too many diseases though they do offer the main character and his wife a spot in their society.Most of the film is spent watching the man and wife drive or walk or stand around or sit at desks doing nothing.  You wish they It falls into that narrow range of wasted celluloid between Star Odyssey and UFO Target Earth.",

There was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as I remember.

Also, other people say this is a spoof, but I do not think so.  For a spoof, you need something called humor.  This lowbudget crapfest did not have a shred of humor, and it did not make much sense, either.  You doing violence The spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster, so I guess that is good enough.The military tries feebly to kill the monster, which is not much larger than a man.  They have very bad aim.  Then the military FLEES!  Wow, did this movie make the U.S. military look pathetic or what?  The monster, while hard to kill, does not do much besides shuffle around and roar.  Oh, and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks.  It was a slightly interesting, yet a total Alien ripoff.What was the deal with the scientist playing the Xylophone to attract the monster?  It was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality.  Also, why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long?  Why did not the monster go into the closet when it had a chance?  Why do I insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless?",

		"I added NOTHING This movie makes the mother, a former Las Vegas chorus girl, seem to be incapable of surviving on her own, although she is clearly in her 50s though hinted at being in her 40s.  I did not buy it.  I am 57 and like all the women I know in their 50s and 40s, more than capable of surviving on my own as I have been doing since I graduated from high school at 13, got legally emancipated and set off on my own lifes journey.  The daughter is not believable in her job role ... she gets a promotion she does not deserve a great opportunity and drops that ball too, but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver, the writers shoot her down as an opportunist, when she was just doing what any careeroriented person would do  taking advantage of a wideopen opportunity created by the lack of selfdiscipline of her coworker, a girl who apparently does not understand the concept of honoring her promises to her boss, in this case.The daughter grudgingly allows her mother to stay with her, on a temporary basis, but then treats her mother the woman who gave her Life and raised her to adulthood like a pariah.  Apparently the writers of tripe like this do not understand that it is NOT the common thing for PARENTS to act like children, and then be treated AS children by THEIR children.  That is just more of the societal baloney that Hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we, their public, were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings.This is a sad movie with a stupid ending.  If the young male restauranteur had been real and not a twodimensional tv character, he would have stayed with the MOTHER, who was not that much older than him and quite attractive.  But in the end he falls for the daughter, a shallow, rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth, but in an ordinary, bland way.  The opportunist young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive, physically.There was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter who was an uptight, selfish, selfcentered btch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect to the mother  a woman who was kindhearted, sweettempered, humorous, and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend.

		"I hate to sound like an old person, but frankly I have not seen too many movies that I like that were made after 1960... generally, movies just seem to get worse and worse although I quite enjoyed the Scott Baio vehicle The Bread, My Sweet, except for the de rigeur sex scene which added NOTHING of value to THAT movie.  This movie makes the mother, a former Las Vegas chorus girl, seem to be incapable of surviving on her own, although she is clearly in her 50s though hinted at being in her 40s.  I buy it I am 57 and like all the women I know in their 50s and 40s, more than capable of surviving on my own as I have been doing since I graduated from high school at 13, got legally emancipated and set off on my own lifes journey.  The daughter is not believable in her job role ... she gets a promotion she does not deserve a great opportunity and drops that ball too, but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver, the writers shoot her down as an opportunist, when she was just doing what any careeroriented person would do  taking advantage of a wideopen opportunity created by the lack of selfdiscipline of her coworker, a girl who apparently does not understand the concept of honoring her promises to her boss, in this case.The daughter grudgingly allows her mother to stay with her, on a temporary basis, but then treats her mother the woman who gave her Life and raised her to adulthood like a pariah.  Apparently the writers of tripe like this do not understand that it is NOT the common thing for PARENTS to act like children, and then be treated AS children by THEIR children.  That is just more of the societal baloney that Hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we, their public, were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings.This is a sad movie with a stupid ending.  If the young male restauranteur had been real and not a twodimensional tv character, he would have stayed with the MOTHER, who was not that much older than him and quite attractive.  But in the end he falls for the daughter, a shallow, rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth, but in an ordinary, bland way.  The opportunist young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive, physically.There was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter who was an uptight, selfish, selfcentered btch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect to the mother  a woman who was kindhearted, sweettempered, humorous, and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend.  Of course the mother had her own flaws... she had reacted to her husbands demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter.Regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed, this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually LIKE baloney.

		"Having seen men Behind the Sun I guess I hoped for an evolution in style  technique to match the larger scale of this movie.  I see someone This plays like a bottomtomid tier European Nazi exploitation movie from the 70s  e.g.  SS Experiment Camp etc perhaps more like Deported Women of the Special Section actually.  Granted it has a greater scope and more people running around, but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lots of hapless nonactors limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots, spiced up with the occasional poorly executed shock sequence.  The admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power.  Watch channel 4s The Holocaust aired recently still running? , as of 1 No 2006 for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the evils of war featuring excellent incontext use of actual footage.  This is the type of treatment the horror of Nanjing deserves, not this hackneyed exploitation garbage a better executed exploitation movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine, but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie.  Rating 3 5 as exploitation, 1 as a treatment of the subject.",
		"Although, I had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie, this sure as hell was not what I would have had in mind, had anything actually come to mind.  Once I heard of its existence, all I knew was that I had to own a movie called Please Do not Eat The Babies. unfortunately, I could only find a copy under its alternate title, Island Fury.  Looking back, I guess I could call it a loselose situation.  On one hand, I still do not get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called Please Do not Eat The Babies, and on the other hand, Island Fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful, pointless, boring, unwatchable piece of garbage.  Yeah, definitely loselose.I am not even sure what genre they are going for here.  Just early 80s badness, with a flashback that might actually be longer than the nonflashback.  First up, two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys, once caught, the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string, around her neck, and somehow, these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere.  And this is where things start to get weird, somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island, years earlier, when they were only 10.  I guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is.  So, now, we are in the past, while the girls try to retrace their steps, so these bad guys do not kill them, although, I would not have minded if they had.  In the flashback, the 10 year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends, eventually stopping by an island for some air, they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents.  Any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up, but the flashback was undeniably better than the present, which, still, is not saying much.For a while there I had forgotten about the original story, At one point, I Ithought maybe the director had too, and when the flashback ended, that would be the end, which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a halfhour shorter.  This pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end, and real stuff does happen, but it is stupid.  I guess I My advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like Attack Of The Beast Creatures.  If anyone, I would only recommend this one to serious Bmovie collectors who must have them all, anyone else interested probably has brain damage.  What really gets me is that I still have no idea why they called it Please Do not Eat The Babies. 310",
		"This really should deserve a O rating, or even a negative ten.  I watched this show for ages, and the show jumped the shark around series 7.  This episode, however, is proof that the show has jumped the shark.  It be fun However, there is such thing as ridiculous as in this is the worst thing I have ever seen.  And indeed, this is the worst episode of Stargate I have ever seen.  It is absolutely dreadful, and this coming from someone with a stargate in her basement.Makes me want to sell all of my stargate props, most seriously.",
		"I do not remember the last time I reacted to a performance as emotionally as I did to Justin Timberlakes in Edison.  I got so emotional I wanted to scream in anguish, destroy the screen, readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism.  Timberlake casting him But that is almost beside the point.Timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role.  I used to have problems with Ben Afflecks acting talent, but Timberlake makes Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench.  With his metrosexual lisp read lithp, his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like The 25 Clich? Expressions for Actors, he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly, and no matter how you slice it, I do not and will not buy his role as an amateurturnedcrusaderforjustice journalist.  It simply will not fly.However, Timberlake alone is not to blame for his failure.  Director David J.  Burke puts him not only in the essentially primary role, but also places him aside Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and I am surprised he was as good LL Cool J.  I can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with Timberlake.There is an upside to this of course the moment any of these actors interact without Justin there it feels like a double relief.  A pleasure, if you will.  Freeman and Spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together, but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our socalled hero.  Dylan McDermott is also a breath of fresh air.But enough of Timberlake bashing  words are not enough in this particular case to do the trick.  Edison is a very, very runofthemill corruption story.  It is plot ranges from clich? to simply preposterous.  I do, however, admire the motivation behind making it, which I interpret as an homage to films like Serpico, or Donnie Brasco, or maybe even Chinatown.  Do not get me wrong  Edison is not even in the same ballpark as these films, but I can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence, perhaps to justify my sitting through it.The script, in and of itself, features some surprisingly bad writing.  Yes, it has some decent interchanges, but any conversation between Piper Perabo who is wasted here and Timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a Dawsons Creek episode.  It is your typical fartooglibforreality, let usimpresstheaudiencewithhowwellwearticulate and fail dialogue.  This dialogue, mind you, is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments  sometimes it feels like Edison wants to morph into a music video, where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting, but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds read slowmotion.Thinking about it, Edison is a curiosity.  It is sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by Timberlake who simply does not work.  In film as in most art, if one thing is off, the whole thing feels off.  Directors must make tough choices.  David J.  Burke missed the mark here.  Some of the scenes play well in and of themselves, but as a whole, they do not seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture.

It started fairly strong with a promising plot...then she bakes cookies...goes to Spain....she sulks, she stares....the credits roll.  Uneven, full of holes, false starts  dead ends.  We FFd through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space.  Artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried.  Zzzz......  It is like a beautifully shot chickflick that is pretending to be deep or artsy.  You never get to know nor understand Morvern at all.  About halfway through you just do not care anymore.  We just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop.  Do not waste your time on this.  I shocked it",
		"Nothing happens.Then characters with no personality do not develop.Then the end never comes because there is no beginning and no middle.There are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they are not even allowed to be, because this movie is not even THERE.  There is no is in this movie because there is no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point.  There is nothing!  There is a good point it has a good soundtrack.  But the sound editing is such and the movie proper is such that watching it is not even worth your time, so if you are really interested, I would suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something.  You get everything",
		"When a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible, the cause can invariably be found in the book either it was pointless to start with, or the point is one not easily conveyed to film, or the movie missed the point, which is the most frequent of these results, and the easiest to happen, especially when the point is one not easily defined.  The book Morvern Callar has a point; every reader of the book must have felt this, and felt as if he had gotten it; but I suspect most of them could not state it in words.  I is life No doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition.  But the important fact is that there is a pointpossibly the sum of the entire story is the pointand that this would have been the main thing to keep in view, and to carry over, in adapting the story to film.  The maker of this film evidently missed the point, and does not substitute one of her own; and so the film is about nothing.This is not the usual complaint of a booklover that his favorite text has been violated.  The merit of the book is something I conceded grudgingly in reading it I found it a bloody nuisance, and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly.  The narrative is supposed to be the work of the halfeducated Morvern, but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect, as if the author were poking at her with his pen; there are inconsistencies of style and tone, as if different sections had been composed at different times; and any conclusions I could reach about Morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not for instance, despite Morverns own selfcharacterization as a raver, am I wrong that in the end she remains essentially a workingclass Scots girl, and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past?  In any case, despite my irritation at the author, I could not deny that his book stuck with me; and what I could not get out of my head was his characters attitude, her angle on the world, which was almost as vivid as a Goya portrait.  Morvern is the kind of person who is always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible; occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her, like flies, so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful sloggingthrough, unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophicaland that does not begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough.  The complex of incidents and of Morverns responses to them are the substance of the book, and its achievement, in exposing a crosssection of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise; for all my dislike of the book, I can see this.The Morvern just described is not the Morvern of the movie; or if it is, most of her is kept offscreen.  An actress who might have been a good fit for the character, had she been the right age at the right time, is Angharad Rees, from the old TV series Poldark.  Samantha Morton, then, would seem like good casting she is rather the same sort of actress, and in one of her earlier movies, Jesus Son, she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one.  Unfortunately, as the film turned out, she does not have the character from the book to play.  For one thing, the book is one that, if it is to be dramatized, virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience; without her comments, her perspective, her voice, the story loses most of its meaning.  It has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty, and so Morverns responses whether of amusement or distaste, depending on her mood are missing too, and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story.  In short, the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk, edgy seriocomic novel into a genteel art TV film, and chose as her typical image one of Ms.  Morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy; as if the outing Morvern signs up for were a tour of the Stations of the Cross.  This is not at all what the book, or the Morvern of the book, was about.  For another thing, the Morvern of the movie is not Scottish the actress said in an interview she had not had time to study up the accent, and she ought to be it is important that she, her family, and her mates are all from a single place.  And finally the film is missing the end of the story Morverns spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness it is winter, the dam has frozen, the power has gone out, and the pub is dark.  Minus this, and minus all of the rest, what is left is a failed art film, a dead film, about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal, or native inability, ever to give in to being dead.",

Agonisingly slow to develop a nonexistent plot based on a promising premise, the experience is, shall we say, trying.  Even after bad movies I feel that I learn something, or enjoyed some aspect, but there there was nothing to appreciate.  The premise was not uninteresting, but the movie starts and ends there.  The acting was OK, though the characters were utterly boring.  For the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal, she is mightily empty.  Pity.  I enjoy movies",

The protagonist are two young men that do not manage to direct their life in any serious fashion, and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility  a sort of fear of growing up.  The narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models.  Quite the clich?.  Although the story is mildly funny, the acting is good and as a young person one can sort of identify with the characters crazy situations and complicated love affairs, I do not find the story or the characters very believable.  To polished and lacking in depth.  This film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as Friends yes that show on TV.Has Norwegian film finally found its identity?  Audience pleasers in well known American style.How about watching Lukas Moodyssons Tillsammans Together.",

		"After watching a dozen episodes, I decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling.  In the episodes that Charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models, I thought that my profession was being joked about.  I am not a mathematician, instead a chemical engineer, but I do work a lot with mathematical models.  So I will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to makebelieve of fairy tales.First, choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task.  Charlie Eppes is shown as a genius, but even him would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model, specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future.  Individuals are erratic and haphazard, there is no modeling for them.  Isaac Asimov even wrote about that in the 1950s.  Even if there were a model for specific kind of individual, it would be a probabilistic stoichastic one, meaning it has good chance of making a wrong prediction.Second, supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found, the model parameters have to be known.  These parameters are the constants of the equations, such as the gravity acceleration 9.8 ms2, and often are not easy to determine.  Again, Charlie Eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses.  And after the model and the parameters are chosen, they would have to be tested.  Oddly, they are not, and by miracle, they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted.Third, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected, not only by Numbers, but also by scifi movies the computational effort required for solving these models.  Try to make Excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a Herculean job.  Even if Charlie Eppes has the right software to solve his models, he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow.  And even with the right softwarehardware combination, the model solution might well take days to be reached.  He solves them I could use his computer in my research work, I would be very glad.As a drama, it is far from being the best show.  The characters are somewhat stereotyped, but not even remotely funny as those in Big Bang Theory are.  The crimes are dull and the way Charlie Eppes solves them sometimes make the FBI look pretty incompetent.For some layman, the show might work.  For others, the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow!",

This show reminds me of the math major I used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to support points that every one else had already agreed on through either lesscomplex analysis or basic common sense.It just goes to show  When you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

		"This is really really bad.  Lamas does his But what makes it worth watching is the scene where OJ angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric I got the evidence on you!.  Makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics  attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren but i could not find it on iTunes.  Talk about seeing into the future...Too funny for words.  The rest of the movie is forgettable.  The score and songs are more interesting than the script.  Ditto the sequel.  Which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all.  My understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these B movies.  Does not say much for the worlds viewing habits.",

		"Lorenzo Lamas stars as some type of CIA agent, who captures some exotic beauty named Alexa, kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers.  O.J Simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble.  I must admit i am not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas, or his movies.  He stinks.  However when compared to O.J Simpson and Lamas comatose wife Kinmont, Lamas seems like ah, JeanClaude Van Damme.  I saw CIA The movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of O.J Simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor.  Also where was Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make this a complete camp classic?   out of 4Bad",
		"As an impressionable 10 year old, I liked the love conquers all philosophy of the 70s sitcom Bridget Loves Bernie.  I did understand the controversy, which was about the romantic complications between a Jewish cab driver David Birney and an Irish Catholic school teacher Meredith Baxter and both sets of parents Harold J.  Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernies parents; Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridgets parents who have issues with the young couples interfaith marriage.Looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences, I am amazed that the show was even a success for one, albeit, highlyrated season.  Created by veteran TV writer Bernard Slade, who a few years after the show is cancellation would write the successful play Same Time, Next Year, Bridget Loves Bernie was a very light, superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight.There was no denying the reallife chemistry between Birney and Baxter.  But, in later years, both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects Birney in his shortlived role in St.  Elsewhere and Baxter in Family and Family Ties.  Here, they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge, which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject.The show aired Saturday nights between two CBS powerhouses All in the Family and Mary Tyler Moore.  Both of those shows were smart, funny and had enough of an edge more so on the former that the latter that kept my interest in the situation and the characters.  Bridget Loves Bernie",
		"This film was hard to get a hold of, and when I eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming.  I takes advantage With all of this builtin interest, how could anyone make such a lackluster, talkladen flick of this truelife event.  While Williams is always interesting, the screenwriters assumed that the D.B.  Cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star, s what we get is a typewithout any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off.  Harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty, but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction.  Shame on this film for even existing.",
		"As someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating truelife tale, I was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been.THE BAD  I am a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he has played, but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator.The dialog is insipid and the pretty Kathryn Harrold is real garbagemouth.  From what I read, there were several directors replacing each other on this film, and that is too bad.  You tell things I could not get involved with Treat Williams portrayal of Cooper, either.  He should have been fascinating, but he was not in this movie.  It is also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of folk hero, but I admit I wound up rooting for the guy, too.Not everything was disappointing.  I cannot complain about the scenery, from the lush, green forests of Oregon to the desert in Arizona.I would like to see this movie remade and done better, because it is a oneofakind story.",

		"I cannot believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny.  Shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty, disgust and stupidity, There is Something About Mary leaves little reason to stay until the end.  Sure, Cameron Diaz is very pretty, but that is never going to be enough to save a movie.  Ben Stiller tries hard to work within the plot, and is obviously very talented, but the movie is a loser.Not once were any of the scenes believable.  The shots were badly timed and poorly framed.  The Farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs.  I check IMDB It is not like I am immune to humor or alone in my opinion.  My wife hated it, too.  The next day we saw Rush Hour and laughed ourselves silly.  This movie just stunk.",

I mean it It also show is how people give the Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype, by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad Muslims out it does not mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time, like how hard it was for Amair to get on a plane and how he used words like Blow up or Yaser saying we will blow away the competition, and people took it the wrong way.  Being a Muslim i know that stuff like this do not usually happen, but they do and many people think bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq, its not right things are not like that. people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act.  I am glad a show like this came on the air.  There are many shows that Piotr Muslim people as terrorists,many people do find them funny to my opioion it is OK to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair, but it is done to often and really gives Muslin people a bad name.",

It overcome prejudice The new vicar ruins that premise and shows Christians in a very bad light.I am neither Christian or Muslim, but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between Amar and the Reverend.

		"Who likes awful comedy shows like Little Mosque on the Prairie?  The only two kinds of people I can think of who watch this are One, Muslims and selfproclaimed Liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about Muslims that it does not even matter if the show is good or funny at all which it is not.  Two, old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable, badly written, stale jokes.CBC needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is.  If they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen, their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left.  I would be curious who even writes for this show?  Do you think it is actually Muslims, or hip, funny young people?  No, I bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC shows since the 1960s.When you look at the CBC comedy shows there are, Air Farce was only finally just taken off the air thank goodness!  but we still have lame ducks like This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Rick Mercer that we are paying for, not to mention this poor excuse for comedy Little Mosque on the Prairie.

I doubt that CBC has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle.  A comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in Corner Gasi.e. the aboriginal characters are not set apart by their ethnicity nor is their heritage used to generate story lines.

The only saving grace is the talented Derek McGrath, who is horribly wasted here.  I doubt that even the addition of guest stars Colin Mochrie, for example, as an Anglican archbishop can save this dog.  I decided to give the show a chance once the CBCs hype had died down; but two episodes were all I could standI could almost feel my braincells shutting themselves down with each failed punchline.  The timeslot would be better served by airing more Coronation Street, Air Farce reruns, or Dr.  Who.  Even an infomercial would be an improvement.",

I decided to give the show a chance once the CBCs hype had died down; but two episodes were all I could standI could almost feel my braincells shutting themselves down with each failed punchline.  The timeslot would be better served by airing more Coronation Street, Air Farce reruns, or Dr.  Who.  Even an infomercial would be an improvement.",
		"This show is a perfect example of how the CBC should stick to either news, sports, or satirical sketch comedy.  As a developer of situation comedy, CBC has shown it can combine the pizazz of King of Kensington with the belly laughs of The Beachcombers.  It is an embarrassment to great shows like Kids in the Hall and Second City that they have to share their comedic roots with this lame production.I have to admit, that I did not give this show much of a chance right from when I first heard of its concept.  To start, half of the concept is a direct attempt to ripoff one of the few sitcom successes in EnglishCanadian history, Corner Gas.  The rest of the conceptthe cultural clashis far from being original and is too often used as a crutch for screen writing laziness.  The selection of the Muslim religion as the basis for the fish out of water characters seems to be a desperate attempt to be edgy and topical, but comes off as forced.  Some of the jokes that are based around the locals reaction to the newcomers are cringe inducing and thoroughly insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved, especially the audience.This show is a perfect example of how CBC just does not get it when it comes to creating Canadian content, especially when presenting Canada as a multicultural environment.  Cultural diversity in Canada does not have to be presented in such a heavyhanded and forced way.  It would be a refreshing change to see CBC introduce diversity into a television show without making the show all about said diversity.  I doubt that CBC has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle.  A comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in Corner Gasi.e. the aboriginal characters are not set apart by their ethnicity nor is their heritage used to generate story lines.  More realistically, their lives and the other characters lives intertwine in a way that makes ethnicity no more significant than any of their other personal characteristics.That being said, even as a formulaic fishoutofwater comedy this show fails.  The acting is weak, the comic pacing all over the map, and the story premises that I saw were too far beyond the suspension of belief, even for a comedy.  The only saving grace is the talented Derek McGrath, who is horribly wasted here.  I doubt that even the addition of guest stars Colin Mochrie, for example, as an Anglican archbishop can save this dog.  I feel my The timeslot would be better served by airing more Coronation Street, Air Farce reruns, or Dr.  Who.  Even an infomercial would be an improvement.",
		"I think the show had a pretty good concept to work with.  But the execution was poor.  The script is poor and acting is bad.  There were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way, like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard.  The show cannot be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably.  I should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of Muslim community to some extent.Till now second season is worse than the first one.  I had my Still I appreciate CBC for putting up such concept in front of the viewers.  Anyway I wish best of luck for the future.",

		"While I have never been a fan of the original ScoobyDoo due to its horrid production values, it appears like Shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by HannaBarbera!  Without a doubt, ScrappyDoo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children and this includes the Teletubbies as well as Tommy the Tapeworm.  Whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the ScoobyDoo characters with it?!  Whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show I think death is preferable.  The bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny, annoying and grates on the nervesand this is only in the BETTER episodes!!  After many years, it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess!  I hates him",
		"God, I was bored out of my head as I watched this pilot.  I had been expecting a lot from it, as I am a huge fan of James Cameron and not just since Titanic, I might add, and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality Then again, he also wrote the leaden Strange Days...  But the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration.  In all that time, it barely went beyond its two line synopsis, and I would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere.  On top of that, I do not think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular ATeam episode.  As for Alba, yes, she is gorgeous, of course, but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie pouty and surly, makes me also get bored of her gal wit an attitude schtick pretty soon.  You count me Cameron!",

		"Saw this film ran in the wee hours on TCM.  Several problems with the film were apparent from what I saw.  First, the adults did not age when the children did for 10 years.

		"By 1941 Columbia was a fullfledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as MGM, Paramount or Warners.  That is the best thing that could be said about Adam Had Four Sons, a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by Ingrid Bergman topbilled for the first time in an American film and Warner Baxter.  Bergman grown men Just about everyone in the movie is so goodygood it is a relief when Susan Hayward as the villainess enters midway through  she is about the only watchable person in the movie even though she is clearly channeling Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; it is also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles  but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous.  No wonder Bergman turned down the similarly plotted The Valley of Decision four years later.",
		"You would think that with Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter that this film would have been a lot better.

Everything adores Bergman Well, that is until the mother Fay Wray dies, the stock market crashes in 1907 wiping out the familys fortune and Bergman is forced to go back home to France.  This portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet, but not bad.Later, after the familys fortunes have improved, Bergman returns.

To make things worse, she comes to live in the family home while David is at war.Now here is where the movie gets really, really dumbbrainachingly dumb.  Hayward begins an affair with one of Davids brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers, Bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her, not Hayward with Jack!

This was exactly the sort of excuse Bergman needed to get rid of the guttersnipe once and for all!  This is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad...and most likely did the same to the audiences back in 1941.The rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for Haywards evilness to be exposed.  This just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess.  As expected, however, the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once againhappy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut, Hayward.The film suffers because of poor writing.

		"We all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books.  While not particularly accurate adaptations, these movies were nonetheless excellent films.  Some great examples are the Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and, to a lesser extent, almost every Disney film ever made.  However, I must regretfully announce that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those movies.  Not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of Madeleine LEngles fan base, it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting, acting, special effects and, ultimately, respect for the audience.  Mind you, I am not trying to be mean; on the contrary, I went into this affair with an open mind.  I figured that a madeforT.V. movie would make up for its lack of razzledazzle in its script.  After all, the Star Wars spinoff Ewoks was decent, if a little silly.  Come to think of it, the original Star Wars was made on a lunch money budget, and look where it took George Lucas!  However, from the first scene onward, disappointment started enveloping me as if I would gotten too close to the Black Thing while tessering.  The same way Greedo shooting first became the symbol of the Star Wars Special Edition of 1997 a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic, Mrs.  Whatsit become my The reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief.  Aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting Alfre Woodard Star Trek First Contact and Radio as our favorite starturnedmentor, the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow.  That is right, a crow.  Moreover, the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eightyearold; the majestic halfman, halfhorse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle.  Had I been five, this would have psychologically traumatized me for life.  The worst part is the fact that when it spoke, it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync, resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single, unmoving cheek, thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than E.T.Having gotten the most painful part out of the way, I must go on to the tearinducing one the characters, the acting, and the story.  I, personally, had always imagined Meg to look somewhat similar to Moaning Myrtle from the Harry Potter films plain hair, glasses, and a figure most supermodels would find laughable.  She was always a slightly anxious, humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of Nicaragua.  In the film, she is an unpleasant knowitall for whom I have no sympathy whatsoever.

		"I only recently found out that Madeleine LEngles novel had been turned into a TV movie by Disney and ordered the DVD.  The book was a favorite of mine when I was a child and I read it several times.Despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel, the Murry family is well cast, with a likable if too pretty Meg at the center and a Charles Wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating.  The first half hour is promising enough, doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene.  Unfortunately as soon as the nonhuman characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart.  Alfre Woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric Mrs Whatsit think Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright instead and Kate Nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive, she must have visited Faye Dunaways plastic surgeon in recent years.  For some reason they make her Mrs Which look like Glinda from The Wizard of Oz when she should have resembled a benign Wicked Witch of the West.In the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction.  I understand that this is a TV movie, but the CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier.  Mrs Whatsits centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the Chewbacca like suit for Aunt Beast, who in the novel is a velvety, elegant creature instead of the ungainly Big Foot like thing shown here.  I lacks imagination What a shame that with the current popularity of adapting childrens literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting A Wrinkle in Time and it is sequels for the big screen, giving it the scope it deserves.",
		"I have never read the bookA wrinkle in time.  To be perfectly honesty, after seeing the movie, do I really want to?  Well, I should not be reviewing this movie i will start off with that.  Next i will say that the TV movie is pretty forgettable.  Do you know why I say that?  Because I forgot what happens in it.  I told you To be perfectly honest, no TV movie will ever be better than Merlin.How do I describe a TV movie?  I have never written a review for one before.  Well, i will just say that they usually have some celebrities.  A wrinkle in time includes only one.  Alfre WoodardOr Woodward, I am not sure, the Oscar winner.  The film has cheesy special effects, a mildly interesting plot, scenes that make you go WTF.  The movie is incredibly bad and it makes you goWTF.  What did I expect?  It is a TV movie.  They usually are not good.  As is this one.  A wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster.  To top it off, you will most likely forget about it the second it is over.  Well, maybe not the second it is over.  But within a few minutes.A wrinkle in time",
		"I was browsing through Netflix and stumbled upon this movie.  Having fond memories of the book as a child, I decided to check this out.  This is a movie that you should really pass on.It is just not worth seeing.  It is very boring and uninteresting.  I feel that it would even be that way to small children.  It has no magic that the book contains.  This movie is not horrible, but you will just find yourself not caring ten minutes into it.There are moments that just come off as weird.  The witch character is not very good.  The family acts like it is no big deal that these odd things are happening.  I sent it I really did not care how it finished.

		"this may be a bit on the spoilerish side I would like to start by saying I did not watch the entire movie, nor could I because it was evident from the first hour that I was going to be incredibly disappointed.  That of course is the problem with taking, what many believe to be an amazing book, and turning it into a Disney MadeforTV movie.A Wrinkle in Time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago.  It is got a great storyline that could hook children and adults.  Plus it is got built in quality sequels.  But Disneyfying was not the way to go.  The problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book.  It is a complicated and emotional story for kids.  There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely psychic, because that was the easiest way of explaining it.  There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs.  Ws as added tension, there is enough tension in the story without that.  There was no reason to remove Megs glasses... that deprived us of what could have been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg that happens in the book.I could nitpick for days about little things, but I also think larger things, like the art direction was a off.  Take for instance the way they made Camazotz look, with its strangely darkened skies.  The creepiness that comes across in the book is that Camazotz could be Earth.  It looks like earth.  It has people The skies are blue, the grass is green, and there are children playing.  But something is a little bit off.  The directors chose to make Camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie.  The lesson of course is that Camazotz could very well be Earth, that is if we forget how to love.  It would have been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they are walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm.I unfortunately did not watch the end.

		"I really did not like this movie because it did not really bring across the messages and ideas LEngle brought out in her novel.  We loved it There were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just did not do any credit to the imaginative genius that is Madeleine LEngle!  This is the reason i gave it such a poor rating.  Do not see this movie if you are a big fan of LEngles texts because you will be sorely disappointed.  However, if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes or educational as was my case then it is an alright movie!",
		"I have read the whole A wrinkle in time book and then saw the movie.  The movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting.A wrinkle in time is about a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin must team together to find Megs father and get off the island Camazotz.  The beginning of the film is really a stinker.  The acting is awful, the direction is laughable, and so far the situations are not necessary.  I really was crushed to see the same person Madeleine Engle that wrote the book and created the movie, made a great book, and a terrible film.  The acting is worse than any straighttovideo acting.  Yes, I got to admit there was cool effects.  But seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible.  If you read the book you will be crushed by the movie.  I give it A half could have been useful.",
		"The Wrinkle in Time book series is my favorite series from childhood.  I reread them The characters, with all their virtues and flaws, are near and dear to my heart.  This adaptation contained very little of the wonderful, magical, spiritual story that I love so much.  To say I was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement.If you have never read the books I imagine you will enjoy the movie.  The acting is passable, the special effects are well done for a made for TV movie, and the story is interesting.  However, if you love the books, avoid this movie at all costs.I found this statement at the Wikipedia page of the novel In an interview with Newsweek, LEngle said of the film, I expected it to be bad, and it is.I, like another reviewer here, feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind.",
		"This ABC straighttoTV failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is A Wrinkle in Time.  Ms.  Madeleine LEngle brought children and adults alike into a magical, fantastical and original world like no author before her.  This novel, the first in her time quartet, is a beautiful take on life, the universe, and time itself.  Yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand.  Its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book.  This film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of Ms.  LEngles work of art.  Honestly, what were they thinking?  The effects look cheap and ridiculous, the plot is mushy and uneven, the dialogue is farfetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost.  This was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen.  I understands it This adaptation can only be compared to boring, fake and cheap motelroom art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience.",
		"Disney?  What happened?  I really wish the movie had been set in the 60s ;like the book was.  And I really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption.....  I am glad that, maybe, someone might be influenced to read the books..... but, The Man With Red Eyes interchangeable as IT?  And what is up with the volcanic upheaval?  Where was THAT in the book?  Peter Jackson!  Save us!!!!  A long time ago 1978 I heard that there was European version of this film.  I wish I I can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption.  This movie needs to be Xd.",

		"I regret every single second of the time I lost while watching this movie, really.  Unhappily, I always find it hard to switch off a movie once I started watching it.  Especially, when it is such a classic or what people use to call a classic.  I watched it Do not get me wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall both as a couple and as actors, but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion.  No really good plot, neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story.  Well, not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres.  Only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether Bogey and Bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another.  I think To Have and Have Not is very overrated and Bogart was in many better films during the 1940s.",

		"This is one of those films that I could only sit through once.  Charlotte Henry is fine  in fact, all the actors were fine.  The problem was in the script, the dialog, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects.  Granted, this was 1933, but it really creaked.  Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C.  Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming.  The movie just clumped along with no cohesion.  Much of Lewis Carrols spirit, humor and continuity are missing.  What a pity!  It is such a great book.  I recommend Disneys",

There is nothing real in this film.  None made its Hard to believe this was one of the best films submitted...In any case, it made me loose what was left of my respect for the Sundance brand.",
		"I ask yourself This does not really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film does not tack on one of those happy endings.  Story is about an American couple who travel to Kyoto, Japan so that Ted Fletcher Edward Albert can write a book and he brings along his wife Laura Susan George and their daughter Amy Amy Barrett.  Their friend Alex Curtis Doug McClure who works at the American Consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted.  About 140 years earlier in the same house a Samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide.  Their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the Fletchers arrive it does not take long before strange things start happening.SPOILER ALERTAt times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the Fletchers and they start to act like the Japanese people that they were before and Laura starts to flirt with Alex which leads to an affair.  Meanwhile, Ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of Amy he goes to ask a Monk for help.  Unfortunately the ghosts get Ted, Laura, and Alex to play out their death scene like it happened 140 years earlier.This film was directed by Kevin Connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with McClure on some of them.  While this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that I liked.  First, it does not have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons.  Instead, it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts.  Secondly, it has Susan George in the cast!  I have always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch.  Also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she does not have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and it is one of the reasons why she was so popular.  But after appearing in silly films such as this I think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically.  This is not a bad film but it is never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the Monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two.  The bottom line is that this is silly and I hope George decides to resume her career.",
		"The film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional Japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads KUSHIATA KYOTO, JAPAN 1840.  A young Japanese trainee Samurai named Masanori Toshiya Maruyama walks up the winding path to the house, inside waits Otami Mako Hattori with whom he is having an affair behind her husband, Shugoros Tsuiyuki Sasaki as Toshiyuki Sasaki back who happens to be Masanoris teacher.  Shugoro arrives home His honour destroyed the enraged Samurai brutally murders both Otami and Masanori before committing suicide.  Over a century later and Ted Fletcher Edward Albert arrives in Japan on a working holiday with his wife Laura Susan George and their young daughter Amy Amy Barrett.  Their close friend Alex Curtis Doug McClure who works for the American consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay, you do not need me to you where!  He jokingly says it is going so cheap because it is haunted, to which both Ted and Laura laugh off as they obviously do not believe in ghosts, at least for the time being that is.  Almost immediately the film goes into clich? mode.  Lights turn on and off by themselves, Laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local Zen Monk Henry Mitowa gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it is too late which they ignore, of course.  The spirits of Otami, Masanori and Shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a Majyo witches Tsuyako Olajima curse put upon them.  But there may be a way they can break the curse, unfortunately for the Fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage, daughter and possibly even their very lives.  Directed by Kevin Connor I thought this was a pretty average film, OK to watch once if you have got nothing better to do but after a day or two you will probably have completely forgotten it.  Nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there is nothing particularly good about the film either.  The script by Robert Suhosky from the novel by James Hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly bythenumbers, a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction does not help things.

		"At the beginning of the film, you might doublecheck the DVD cover and reread the synopsis a couple of times, but no worries.  It is NOT Still, the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie, as it shows how in the year 1840 a Samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery.  He decapitates the two lovers before doing some harakiri ritual suicide through disembowelment.  Cut to present day, when the American Ambassador in Japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago.  From then onwards, this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional.  Let us start with the good aspects, namely the original Japanese setting and the presence of the delicious Susan George who is my alltime favorite British horror wench well, together with Britt Eckland, Linda Hayden and Ingrid Pitt.  The bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent, imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter.  The restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff.  The spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into Susans ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress!  In this possessed state, she even lures the American ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests.  So, strictly spoken, it is not really evil that dwells in the house; just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their longdead hands!  Obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening, especially since the lightblue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in Ghostbusters.  The House Where Evil Dwells is probably the least scary ghost movie ever.  Throughout most of the running time, you will be wondering whether director Kevin Connor who nevertheless made the excellent horror films Motel Hell and From Beyond the Grave intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and overthetop, like Motel Hell maybe.  But then again, everyone in the cast continues to speak hisher lines with a straight and sincere face, so I guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed.  The House Where Evil Dwells is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it does not even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning.  I am fully aware of how shallow it sounds, but the two scenes in which Susan George goes topless are the only true highlights.  Well, those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously oversized spiders or are they crabs?  in the daughters bedroom.  How totally random and irrelevant was that?  If you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation, make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep.Trivia note for horror buffs keep an eye open for the demonmask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant Japanese horror classic Onibaba.",

		"I just rented and watched this movie just to see what is all the fuss about.  So heres what my reactions to it are.  It is easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors.  The main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists.  This concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film.  However, the movie does not shock or disturb me at all.  It bored me This movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minutes.  All lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time, like those scenery scenes and some scenes I described below.Contains spoiler I find the rape scenes quite tame.  I do not know if I have watched the cut or uncut version, if there is actually such a version.  I also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot.  Heres a list on top of my mind.Why do not the rapists rape Jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are.  That would be an excellent time.Why do not they just gang rape her, instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening Jennifers ordeal by such a long time.  It would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way.I found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house.  Maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles.These rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right, they should not send a coward imbecile to do the job.Why did not Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left?  Which should be the first thing that pops up in most peoples mind, especially for someone who is a writer.  Why did not these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw Jennifer is alive? I find it really amazing that a slender lady like Camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him.  Ends spoilerBut hey, this movie is not without its merits, Camille Keaton is gorgeous and I get to hear one of the funniest line I have recently heard when Matthew protest of going back into the house and kills Jennifer, Why me?

		"I have seen the Gator Bait films, and this is almost exactly the same thing as those.  A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them.  The thing that sets this movie apart from those ones although not very far is that the sexual content is not glorified.  There is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film, but not for a second is it ever sexy.  Some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive, but that is only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audiences need to see this woman seek revenge.This is a weak film, it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers.  I Spit On Your Grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral, but I was glad to see that, since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead, it was not meant to pass off as a TA film.Bmovies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality, and while I Spit On You Grave is unmistakably a Bmovie and contains more than its share of nudity, the nudity does not drive the plot.  On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists.  These men are evolutionary dropouts just like they were in the Gator Bait films, and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless Bmovie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind, but instead it simply satisfies the audiences desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve.  The one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks.  Oddly, the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity although not by much, but it is by far the most painful to watch.  We filled us The woman does not live happily ever after, she does not write her book, she does not leave and never return to that nightmare place, she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks.  But hey, what more did you expect? Oh, and did you read the tagline?  If you decide to waste your time watching this, try and find any man getting broken or burned.  I was really looking forward to those",

Whether it was Zarchis attempt to make an antirape statement  and I absolutely do not believe it was  is entirely beside the point.  The film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic everything but actual penetration is shown that NO ONE but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it.The rapes in the film is uncomfortable, brutal and hard to watch.  There is something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes, none.  There was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed mere moments before he is murdered so the scene is not at all engaging on an emotional level.  Really, it is just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies ISOYG is associated with on IMDb Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc. that it attracts only the exploitation crowd.Finally, a few reviewers have commended Zarchis socalled documentary style and lack of a soundtrack.  But considering how inept everything else in the film is acting, script, etc.  I suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porncaliber actors do their thing.I am not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of ISOYG.

		"Quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom.A group of top quality actors, in the main well cast with a couple of notable exceptions, who give pretty good performances.  Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and equally good is Joanna Lumley as Diana.  All do well with the scripts they were given.So much for the good.  The average would include the sets.  Nancherrow is nothing It is clear then that the Dower House is far too big.  In the later parts, the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the UK, presumably to save money, although with a little imagination I have no doubt they could have recreated Ceylon.Now to the bad.  The screenplay.  This is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it.  Edward does not die in the battle of Britain but survives, blinded.  He makes a brief appearance then commits suicide  why??  Loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with Gus to a sensible farmers wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear less emotional than Brief Encounter.  Gus, a man besotted and passionately in love, is prepared to give up his love without complaint.  Walter Mudge in the book turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man.  Jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who will not speak.  Aunt Biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification.  The Dower House is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with Jess who has a fear of armed soldiers.  Whilst Miss Mortimers breasts are utterly delightful, I could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward.  The delightfully named Nettlebed becomes the mundane Dobson.  The word limit prevents me from continuing the list.There is a sequel which I lost all interest in watching after this nonsense and I wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story.  It is difficult to image that Rosamunde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book; presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased.",

		"Dear dear dear dear dear...me!  I see it But why?! The first two films where fun and actually somewhat good.  But this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing.  This was some kind of Tremors for kids.  I cannot believe this movie was made at all..seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind for kids and they just did whatever they could with it.What audience is this movie for?  I can only think of 1214 year olds.  If you are older than 14 you will have serious problems with this movie.  It is not only slow, but it is so utterly boring.  The characters are overacted not just a little either and so stereotyped it is fun for a while..but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen.  You know everything that is going to happen too, cause yes...you have seen it a BILLION times before in any hero series on TV for kids.  I picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced.  It is so bad..so wrong..so...crap.But OK, we did get a laugh now and then.  Not just at the silly plot holes, but some scenes where worth a replay or two...or one scene that is, where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys..It is really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly.  Still makes me grin when I think about it.  But that only happened one more time sadly..and that is when the badass gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully...that and one comment They spring from the ground like some DEMONIC TROUT!  At this point we where almost crying with laughter.  But after that..nothing could ever top that..?.. so it is pretty much downhill from there.  So tops here are demonic trouts and overacting.  If anybody ever tells you this is a good movie...he is either a plant, vegetable or someone very evil.  This movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far.  Looking forward to seeing Tremors 3, it is bound to be box office hit compared to this...this...goosebumps no..I will leave it at that.",

The characters are overacted not just a little either and so stereotyped it is fun for a while..but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen.  You know everything I picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced.  It is so bad..so wrong..so...crap.But OK, we did get a laugh now and then.  Not just at the silly plot holes, but some scenes where worth a replay or two...or one scene that is, where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys..It is really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly.  Still makes me grin when I think about it.  But that only happened one more time sadly..and that is when the badass gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully...that and one comment They spring from the ground like some DEMONIC TROUT!  At this point we where almost crying with laughter.  But after that..nothing could ever top that..?.. so it is pretty much downhill from there.  So tops here are demonic trouts and overacting.  If anybody ever tells you this is a good movie...he is either a plant, vegetable or someone very evil.  This movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far.  Looking forward to seeing Tremors 3, it is bound to be box office hit compared to this...this...goosebumps no..I will leave it at that.",
		"The fourth Tremors feature goes back in time, to the year 1889.  The Legend Begins in the small city of Perfection, which was then Rejection, Nevada.  As the story begins, seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly Graboids.  Some of the characters in the presentday Tremors films have ancestors, both figurative and literal, in the past.  Most obvious is the everreturning Michael Gross as Hiram Gummer.  Unlike his descendant, Mr.  Gross hires gunslinger It is like a western with miniature versions of the original films monster Graboids.  These tamer Dirt Dragons are nowhere near as terrorizing as their Tremors 1990 counterparts.  Consequently, in this film, the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground, which would not have happened in the original movie.  And, it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly, when Gross temporarily decides to leave town.  Why so helpless?  Why did not Brent Roam as Juan Pedilla immediately rally the people to fight without Gross?  Disappointing.  Tremors 4 The Legend Begins 2004 S.S.  Wilson  Michael Gross, Brent Roam, Billy Drago",
		"Warning This review contains minor spoilers.Well the writers of the first Tremors are officially out of ideas.  I am a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare.  Tremors 4 The Legends Begins, however, is a very dull movie.  Where the heck are the Graboids???  Due to the relative lack of Graboids through the first 90 minutes I am convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a character study.  Unfortunately there is not one interesting character in the movie except for Billy Dragos character who is given too few lines, too little to do and in the end too little screen time.  What saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer.  Whenever there was not any action on the screen you could rest assured that Burt Gummer was going to be interesting to listen too andor watch.  However in this movie Gross plays Hiram Gummer a very poor and boring substitute.  On the plus side when the Graboids Dirt Dragons in this movie are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets.I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long.  Pretty good for straight to video.  But after watching it I am sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long.  There are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and does not further the plot any.  Was there a rush to get this movie made?  I thought I What luck I thought, pay for 4 get 1 for free.  Well after watching Tremors 4 I like to think I paid for the original and got this mess for free, I cannot imagine paying a single dime for Tremors 4.  For fans of the series it is best to forget that Tremors 4 The Legend Begins even exists.Tremors 4 The Legend Begins rates a 3 out of 10.",

		"I cannot believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6!  It reminded me It is one of those festival films that only please the pseudointellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it different, therefore good.Bad filmmaking is not different, it is just bad filmmaking.",
		"I cannot believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6!  It is barely watchable and unbelievably boring, certainly one of the worst films I have seen in a long, long time.In a nobudget way, it reminded me of Star Wars Episodes I and II for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck.This film should be avoided at all costs.  It think it",
		"This is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues.  That is no exaggeration you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it.I sincerely thought Fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does ErwinElvira suicides at the end, but instead of this, in every scene somebody is trying to explain when he was young, this happened... and he just came back from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there..., etc.Soon in the movie, ErwinElvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat, and while telling her the story of Elviras life, Fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other.  It giving attention Of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of I have suffered much in my life, and am about to die.In one of the sparse moments where actually happens something, ErwinElvira encounters a former lover, that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality is that he recognizes Elvira.There are some interesting shots and ideas, I must admit such as when the nun tells the story of the young Erwin, but everything on the movie is wasted due to Fassbinders self indulgence.",
		"It is funny.  I have seen a bunch of Fassbinder films and I have found some to be extremely creative and interesting, while others are repellent and selfindulgent messeslike this film.  For me, it ranges from great to crapwithout much in the middle.  I know he From my point of view and I know I will get a lot of negative ratings for this, he made too many movies too quickly and was too selfindulgent.  His gay or genderbending films like this one tend to be really badsloppily done, sometimes quite boring such as QUERELLE and THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT and sometimes just gross like this film.  Could not his message about acceptance of a persons genderconfusion be handled better than showing him get slapped around or watching cows being gruesomely slaughtered?  Show some sensitivity for the subject matter and make your characters more human and sympatheticthen, maybe, I would care about the films.  I am honestly at the point after watching this film that I might not bother with any more Fassbinder filmsthe bad seems to be outweighing the good.",

I hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad.  The nudity keeps it watchable and Warburtons lack of any accent make it at times laughable.

This film was possibly the slowest thing I have ever watched imagine a dopedup snail in space, and really did not do it for me.  The art was alright; the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee, yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced.I am not going to go into huge details about the storyline; basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area.  Generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment, it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across.  For me, I kind of wished that they would get gassed, not because I am a horrible sadistic person, but because the characters were uninspiring, annoying, dull and generally quite rude oh I am so terribly English.  I found that I was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film, and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened, and even that was a terrible anticlimax.If I were to praise it in any way, I would have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite wellmeaning.  Maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy, but the message it is trying to put forth is good in its nature.  The musical score was not bad, too.So, to conclude, this film is pretty poor.

She is still exploring, trying to find more data so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now.  I says Young If she is, we should all age so nicely.  For the most part this film left me cold, though it is by no means the worst of its type you will ever see.  And unlike the recent Eyes Wide Shut, at least something happens in this one.",

		"There are many good things about the new BSG There is the multiple Cylon roles for Model 8 and 6, for example, which the two actresses played superbly.  There is the old school feel of industrial design aboard Galactica My ship will not be networked, over my dead body!  Also, all the space battles, the special effects even though the seasoned scifi watcher will acknowledge the cartoonishness of it all The darkness of the characters, their essentially flawed nature.That makes it all the more bitter that the ending was so childish.Yes, the first part, the scenes in space, the raid on the Cylons and all that was very good.  But the mushy ending?  I watch films So for me it was a special kind of torture, to see the end happen over and over again.  Every time I thought, oh this is the final scene, the final shot, I got one more.  Every frakking character got its complete ending!  That was not really necessary.What really highlighted the schoolboy amateurishness of it all The young Roslin scenes.  Why is important for us to know that {a} she lost her sisters and father in a horrible accident and {b} that she has a one night stand with a former pupilstudent?  What does that bring to the story?  Where was the linkage?  Now, I am all for a more Europeanish style approach, and a random acts of whateverness in films and shows, and all that, but this was just ridiculous.  This did not bring anything meaningful to the story.Also, I have seen the Last Frakkin special and in it Ron revealed his own cluelessness about the plot he could not come up with a good ending for the story, so .... he just did not!  It is never as much about the characters as they made the last episode to be.  The whole this was thousands of years in the past idea, the mitochondrial Eve thing, was also used in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and believe you me, there are a lot of BSG watchers who know that particular H2G2 storyline.  And speaking of Hera, now there is a storyline that WAS NOT worked out well, AT ALL.  Instead we get Roslin is doing her former pupil who is 20 years younger.  Do not get me wrong, I am all for older women with younger men.  The more power to them.  But this ... just made no sense.All in all, the writing in this series is as flawed as they intended its characters would be.  That goes even moreso for the last episode.  I hope Lost and 24 do better, with their series finales.",
		"The fight scenes were great.  Loved the old and newer cylons and how they painted the ones on their side.  It was the ending that I hated.  I was earth But to travel all that way just to start over?  Are you kidding me?  38k people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise, they abandon technology?  No way.  Sure they were eating paper and rationing food, but that is over.  They can live like humans again.  They only have one good doctor.  What are they going to do when someone has a tooth ache never mind giving birth... yea right.  No one would have made that choice.",
		"Did I step in something or is that bad smell coming from Daybreak 1  2?  God was behind everything?  What has God got to do with SciFi?  God is only the answer when you cannot think up a sensible explanation for something.  In fact, this is exactly the problem with the series finale  they obviously could not think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how Kara Thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper, how her old viper and charred body ended up on Earth 2, why Baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head, why 6 has an imaginary Baltar in her head, etc. so they explain it with angels or just do not explain it at all.The plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a Basestar through.  For example, why does Galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl Hera, particularly after Adama said there was no way he would attempt a rescue?  Because they found out the location of the Cylon base?  That is not a good reason to sacrifice the crews lives.  And how did Anders know the location?  And what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters lives before the war?  It do it Feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical Christians on a mission to spread The Word.  Forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot, the important message the writers wanted to get across is do not put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction; God is your ultimate salvation tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment.Imagine in the final movie of the Star Wars series they tell you there is no force... instead, a Jedi actually gets his power from Jesus.  Then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the Ewoks.  Would this be a good ending?  No it frakken would not.",
		"With these people faking so many shots, using old footage, and gassing animals to get them out, not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors, what is to believe?  Old film of countries is nice, but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films.  I lose credibility Portrayed as fliers, they never flew their planes, Martin Johnson was an exvaudevillian, used friends like Jack London for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties, denying his wifes apparent depression, using her as a cute prop, all this makes these films unbearable.  They were by no means the first to travel to these lands, or the first to write about them.  He was OK as a filmmaker and photographer, but that is about it.",
		"The 1930s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world, with an emphasis on wild animals, exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures.  Despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place, and then bringing em back alive with the film footage, such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional Hollywood features ... because there were no expensive sets, costumes, or highpriced movie stars.The most successful makers of such films artistically and financially were the team of Martin E.  Johnson staged events The Johnsons safari films were extremely popular, inspiring several parodies ... most notably Wheeler  Woolseys So This is Africa, in which the very sexy Esther Muir plays a character named Mrs.  JohnsonMartini instead of Martin E.  Johnson, geddit?.  Although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time, the Johnsons films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour.  Viewed from our own more enlightened I hope standpoint, this is a serious flaw in the Johnsons documentaries there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana Johnson and his wife.One definite asset of these movies is the presence of Osa Johnson.  Ten years younger than her husband, she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter.  While certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond Esther Muir, Osa Johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she coproduced with her husband.Congorilla is probably the best of the Johnsons films.  The shots of the Congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in 1930.  The shots of the Pygmies and other natives are also interesting, although these suffer from the Johnsons penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look wild and alien.The best and funniest scene in Congorilla is an improvised sequence in which Osa Johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some Pygmy women.  The dance is the Black Bottom, no less ... the same dance which Bob Hope famously taught to Daisy and Violet Hilton, the conjoined twins.  Wearing jodhpurs, riding boots, and a pith helmet, Osa Johnson starts scatsinging while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the African women.  Meanwhile, they just stand there staring at her, apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish.  It is a very funny scene, but it has unpleasant undertones.  Osa Johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black Americans the implication seems to be that black Africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration using natural rhythm, I guess because it is in their blood, or something.I will rate Congorilla 4 points out of 10.  This film says a little bit about African life in the 1930s and rather more about American cultural perceptions in that same decade.",

		"Oh Dear Lord, How on Earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone?  It reeks of cheese from start to finish, but it is not even good cheese.  It is anyone Yes, if you saw it with a load of drunkstoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way, but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen.  I watched it with an upforafewlaughs guy, having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the films expected crapness.  We got the crapness plenty of it, but not the chuckles.  It does not even qualify as a sobadit isgood movie.  It is just plain bad.  Very, very bad.  Heres why look away if you are spoilerphobic The movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death.  OK, I was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was, but I think I grasped the this guy is a bit of a badass who you do not want to mess with message behind the ingenious scene.  Oh, and a guy witnesses it.  So, we already have our ultraevil bad guy, and wussy but cute apparently good guy.  Cue Hero.  Big Sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion, saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish, i.e.  Hero is immune to bullets, everyone else falls over rather clumsily.  Cue first plot hole.  How the bloody hell did Sammy know where this guy was, or that he would watched the murder.  Perhaps this, and the answers to all my plothole related questions, was explained in the 2 minutes before I got into the cinema, but I doubt it.  In fact, I am going to stop poking holes in the plot right here, lest I turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese which we all know is good cheese.  So, the plot a very generous word to use.  Good guy must get to LA, evil guy would rather he did not, Hero Sam stands between the two.  Cue scenery for the next vomitinducing hour  the passenger plane.  As I said, no more poking at plot holes, I will just leave it there.  Passenger plane.  Next, the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie, and what makes it everything it is  Snakes.  Yay!  Oh, pause.  First we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have.  Hot, horny couple see if you can guess how they die, deadbeforeanysnakesevenappear British guy those pesky Brits, eh? , cute kids, and Jo Brand.  For all you Americans that is an English comic famous for her size and unattractiveness.  Now that we have met the cast, let us watch all of them die except of course the cute kids.  Do not expect anything original, it is just snake bites on various and everincreasingly hilarious really not parts of the body.  Use your imagination, since the filmmakers obviously did not use theirs.So, that is most of the film wrapped up, so now for the best bit, the ending.  As expected, everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face.  Yep, Icecool Sammy included.  But wait, we are not all off the plane yet!  The last guy to get off is good guy, but just as he does he gets bitten by a you guessed it snake of all things.  Clearly this one had been hiding in Mr.  Jacksons hair the whole time, since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier, despite the 200ft constrictor the one that ate that pesky British bugger being unable to.  So, Sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop.  At this point I prayed that the movie was about to make a muchneeded Uturn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort.  But no.  In a kind of icing on the cake way but with stale cheese, remember, it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest.  How anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago, let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me, but it did well in summing up the film.Actually, we are not quite done yet.  After everyone has sucked face Uncle Sam with leading actress, good guy with Tiffany, token Black guy with token White girl, and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia, it is time for good guy and hero to get it on....In Bali!!!  Nope, it was not at all exciting, the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll.  Yes, the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred, and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times.  That is it.  This is the first time I have ever posted a movie review, but I felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography.  If you like planes, snakes, Samuel L.Jackson, air hostesses, bad guys, surfing, dogs in bags or English people, then please, please do not see this movie.  It will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you will never want to come into contact with any of them ever again.  Go see United 93 instead.  THAT was good.",

Yes, if you saw it with a load of drunkstoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way, but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen.  I watched it We got the crapness plenty of it, but not the chuckles.  It does not even qualify as a sobadit isgood movie.  It is just plain bad.  Very, very bad.  Heres why look away if you are spoilerphobic The movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death.  OK, I was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was, but I think I grasped the this guy is a bit of a badass who you do not want to mess with message behind the ingenious scene.  Oh, and a guy witnesses it.  So, we already have our ultraevil bad guy, and wussy but cute apparently good guy.  Cue Hero.  Big Sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion, saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish, i.e.  Hero is immune to bullets, everyone else falls over rather clumsily.  Cue first plot hole.  How the bloody hell did Sammy know where this guy was, or that he would watched the murder.  Perhaps this, and the answers to all my plothole related questions, was explained in the 2 minutes before I got into the cinema, but I doubt it.  In fact, I am going to stop poking holes in the plot right here, lest I turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese which we all know is good cheese.  So, the plot a very generous word to use.  Good guy must get to LA, evil guy would rather he did not, Hero Sam stands between the two.  Cue scenery for the next vomitinducing hour  the passenger plane.  As I said, no more poking at plot holes, I will just leave it there.  Passenger plane.  Next, the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie, and what makes it everything it is  Snakes.  Yay!  Oh, pause.  First we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have.  Hot, horny couple see if you can guess how they die, deadbeforeanysnakesevenappear British guy those pesky Brits, eh? , cute kids, and Jo Brand.  For all you Americans that is an English comic famous for her size and unattractiveness.  Now that we have met the cast, let us watch all of them die except of course the cute kids.  Do not expect anything original, it is just snake bites on various and everincreasingly hilarious really not parts of the body.  Use your imagination, since the filmmakers obviously did not use theirs.So, that is most of the film wrapped up, so now for the best bit, the ending.  As expected, everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face.  Yep, Icecool Sammy included.  But wait, we are not all off the plane yet!  The last guy to get off is good guy, but just as he does he gets bitten by a you guessed it snake of all things.  Clearly this one had been hiding in Mr.  Jacksons hair the whole time, since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier, despite the 200ft constrictor the one that ate that pesky British bugger being unable to.  So, Sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop.  At this point I prayed that the movie was about to make a muchneeded Uturn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort.  But no.  In a kind of icing on the cake way but with stale cheese, remember, it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest.  How anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago, let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me, but it did well in summing up the film.Actually, we are not quite done yet.  After everyone has sucked face Uncle Sam with leading actress, good guy with Tiffany, token Black guy with token White girl, and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia, it is time for good guy and hero to get it on....In Bali!!!  Nope, it was not at all exciting, the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll.  Yes, the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred, and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times.  That is it.  This is the first time I have ever posted a movie review, but I felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography.  If you like planes, snakes, Samuel L.Jackson, air hostesses, bad guys, surfing, dogs in bags or English people, then please, please do not see this movie.  It will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you will never want to come into contact with any of them ever again.  Go see United 93 instead.  THAT was good.",

		"This is not a film you can really analyse separately from it is production.  The audience became the filmmakers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the American film industry; we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend.  How is it possible to be objective?  This is our movie, is not it?  Or is it?  There may be nothing more disingenuous than a filmmaker who promotes himself as the audiences friend, giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them.  Just look at that prime selfpublicist Eli Roth, promising gorehounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films, only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like Hostel.David R.  Ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to his film, but he was, quite understandably, quick to engage with it.  He took the carnivalhuckster school of filmmaking to a new level, getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy.  So many have enthused over this interactive, democratic approach to filmmaking that they seem to have missed the point  that this is the most cynical form of filmasmarketing.  Nothing get bums The fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to know.Is not this just the evolution of the focus group approach?  Individual creativity, talent, craft, ideas, all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses.  It is a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings do not make for good movies  why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different?  Because we happen to be film fans?  Well, thank god for us, because otherwise I might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snake.So, yes, I had fun at the movie  a midnight showing, fresh from the pub and with a bucket of icecream  but it actually had relatively little to do with the film, and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere.  Like Christmas, everyone seemed determined that they would have fun, no matter what.  There was laughter, but I do not know if it was with the film, or at the film.  With a film as calculated as this one, is that even a meaningful distinction?  There are some genuinely good aspects to the film.  Samuel L.  Jackson gives a welljudged performance, pure selfparody but with a real sense of pleasure.  Rachel Blanchard and Lin Shaye are decent in limited roles, and there are one or two inspired moments  the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulate.The stock characters are to be expected, but the total lack of suspense is not.  What is the point of a film that combines two great phobias if there is no creeping menace?  There are several snakejumpsout moments, but they are incredibly badly staged.  Only the annoying British man gets a decent pulpy death scene  the other killings are oddly flat.  The demise of the honeymoon couple, for instance, is shamefully botched.  Most of the actors fail to make an impression; it is a shame that a charismatic actress like Julianna Margulies should seem so tired when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a rollercoaster, she could be talking to the audience  the film falls far short.There are worse movies, but there are many, many better; another reviewer on this site compared this film with Lake Placid, and it is as apt a contrast as any I can think of.  That film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent, the jokes were funny, the suspense sequences were scary, and it was not devised by committee.  That the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus.  I do not need a postpub midnight showing to have a good time with that film.This film will, in time, fade to become a mere footnote in film history.  If it sets a precedent, however, I am genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time.  In all probability, nothing much will come of it.  Perennial popcorn favourites  Raiders of the Lost Ark, Alien, Halloween and of course, Star Wars  just are not produced by groupthink.In the mean time, I will tell you what  I have not half got a craving for some Ingmar Bergman.",

		"Raising Victor Vargas is one of those light, family movies that you can watch and do the N.Y.  Times crossword puzzle And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a Corona, you do not have to Pause the DVD.  Just let it roll, ecause you will not be missing anything really important.  No twists, turns, or tension.  It is not really an ethnic movie, it is a movie about a poor, struggling immigrant family that happens to be Latino.  They could have been any ethnic group.  It made very little difference.  I have seen it all a zillion times before.  Just plug in a Jewish family, an Italian family, a Black family, or an Irish family.  Just the accents and names were different.  If the Vargas family was named Bush or Clinton and were Presbyterians, the movie would have been a total snooze.  It is funny that the critics here could not get the locale straight.  Some said it was Spanish Harlem.  Some the Bronx, and another Brooklyn.  As a lifelong New Yorker, I vote for the Lower East Side.  And it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other Latinos.  They lived in an insulatedisolated little enclave.  Some interaction with nonLatinos might have created some excitement, interest, or tension.  Remember West Side Story? And now for the oftcriticized cinematography.  I do not know if it was my TV or what, but all the indoor shots looked very ORANGE to me.  The apt, the furniture, and the faces were all ORANGE.  What was that supposed to mean?  And the apt. did look pretty cramped to me.  Somebody here mentioned that the old aptstenements had very big rooms.  Well, maybe 50 years ago.  What landlords have done is to break up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them.  And another annoying thing ....This is the second family movie I have seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy jerking off.  Is this private sex act necessary for us to watch?  Please spare me!  What is up with these directors?  So Victor Vargas is a pleasant little movie.  It was nice for a change to see young Latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents, which they did.
