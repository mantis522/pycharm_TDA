		"Homelessness or Houselessness as George Carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school, work, or vote for the matter.  Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism, the war on Iraq, pressuring kids to succeed, technology, the elections, inflation, or worrying if they will be next to end up on the streets.  But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home, the entertainment sets, a bathroom, pictures on the wall, a computer, and everything you once treasure to see what it is like to be homeless?  That is Goddard Bolts lesson.Mel Brooks who directs who stars as Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival Jeffery Tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries; if Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings.  The bets on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he cannot step off the sidewalk.  He got divorce They are survivors.  Bolt is not.  He is not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it is fight or flight, kill or be killed.While the love connection between Molly and Bolt was not necessary to plot, I found Life Stinks to be one of Mel Brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy, it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or Spaceballs for the matter, to show what it is like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they do not know what to do with their money.  Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly money.Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others.",

Dir Patrick Stettner Hitchcockian suspenser gives Williams a standout lowkey performance.What is it about celebrities and fans?  What is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm?  In the latest derange fan scenario, based on true events no less, Williams stars as a talkradio personality named Gabriel No one, who reads stories he is penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named Pete Logand Culkin who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to No ones editor Ashe Morton who gives it to No one to read for himself.  No one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of Pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named Donna Collette giving an excellent performance who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with No one reveals that Pete is dying from AIDS.  Naturally No one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover Jess Cannavale whose sudden departure from their New York City apartment has No one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into Donna and Petes backgrounds discovering some truths that he did not anticipate.Written by Armistead Maupin who cowrote the screenplay with his former lover Terry Anderson and the films novice director Stettner and based on a true story about a fans hoax found out has some Hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned potboiler does.

		"You bless him The dramas he has made lately have been fantastic, especially Insomnia and One Hour Photo.  The Night Listener, despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release, is among his best work, period.This is a very chilling story, even though it does not include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter.  The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed.  In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result.  I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist.  When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker.  Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like Little Miss Sunshine.  There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me.  It takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it is this understated yet well reviewed role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an Academy Award as of 2008.  It is incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it is scary too.This is a good, dark film that I highly recommend.  Be prepared to be unsettled, though, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.",

		"I enjoyed The Night Listener very much.  It is one of the better movies of the summer.Robin Williams gives one of his best performances.  In fact, the entire cast was very good.  All played just the right notes for their characters  not too much and not too little.  Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch.  Toni Collette is great as the Mom, and never goes over the top.  Everyone is very believable.It is a short movie, just under an hour and a half.  I noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version.  I did it It is not a Hitchcockian thriller.  See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story told well.  If you go expecting Hitchcock you will be disappointed.My only complaint with the movie was the ending.  The director could have left a little more to the audiences imagination, but this is a minor quibble.",
		"The Night Listener is probably not one of Williams best roles, but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie.  I guarantee you Some people maybe will not like the slow pacing of this movie, but I think it is the great plus of the movie.  It is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year 2006.  It has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content, dramatic feeling.  This is no americanized movie.  Neither is it a predictable movie.  You just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be.  This is no excellent movie that has everything, but hell, it is a damn good and very original movie.",

		"Like one of the previous commenters said, this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery.  Such a waste because Collettes performance was eerie and Williams was believable.  I just kept waiting for it to get better.  I think it It came across as a Canadian movie, something like the first few seasons of XFiles.  Not cheap, just hokey.  Also, it needed a little more suspense.  Something that makes you jump off your seat.  The movie reached that moment then faded away; kind of like a false climax.  I can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the reality of the story but I thought that part was reached when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy.  This movie needs to have a Directors cut that tries to fix these problems.",

		"The Night Listener held my attention, with Robin Williams shining as a New York City radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy Rory Culkin who is very ill.  Williams has never met the boy in person, as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone.  However, Williams exboyfriend nice job from Bobby Cannavale raises doubt about the boy, which prompts Williams to arrange a meeting with him in person.  What follows makes a permanent impact on Williams in a way he does not expect.  I leave it Toni Collette also stars.I enjoyed this film, with Toni Collette giving a memorable portrayal of Culkins adoptive mother.  Sandra Oh also starred as Williams friend.  The Night Listener is inspired by actual events, and it has a somber, almost creepy silence throughout.  At times it is predictable, no thanks to some of the reviews I read before seeing the movie and just due to logic, but I liked it anyway.  I enjoy Williams in roles like this, more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me.  Recommended. 810",

		"This Night Listener is better than people are generally saying.  It has weaknesses The whole thing feels like one of those fireside this happened to a friend of a friend of mine ghost stories.  One big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate.  Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility, and real life just sort of plods alongno?  So there are no flashy endings or earthshattering revelations, no showdown scenes.  Thank Heaven.  You have to get into the zone when watching this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a conventionallygood movie.  Williams is not terrific, but he easily meets the needs of the story, plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic No One as he is the Everyman, the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story.  Toni Collettes performance should be nominated for an Oscar even if she maybe should not win it.  Give it a shot.  For quality and content alone, The Night Listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days.",

While every movie has its flaws, The Night Listener had an exceptionally low count.If you read the last review it was hard, since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie, you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done.  Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines into that same review, you discovered the posters reason for disdain heshe does not like the fact that the director is gay or that the production team smokes crack...apparently.So, despite the fact that I have never written a review before, I thought this movie deserved one based on its merits, not the sexual orientation of its director.  Let us go over a quick checklist first 1.  Great plot?  Absolutely.  I will not give a shred of it away, but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials.  This is a thriller, not a horror, and it should be approached as such.  The story really will amaze you, even more so because it is true and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events.2.  Wonderful Acting?  Oh Yes.  Robin Williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy typecast, and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago.  He let you Excellent direction?  Certainly.  Now, unlike the other poster to which I referred, I actually know something about direction.  I have been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years.  Of course I really do not think that makes a lick of difference the only thing that matters is if YOU like the direction, but I thought I should simply establish once again that I am basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant...for example not the sexual orientation of the director or the alleged drug habits of the production team, LOL.Patrick Stettners direction was moody and dark, and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those sosoughtafter feelings of tension and release rather than the messy, fastpaced camerawork and quick cuts we are so often subjected to today.  Some people can truly show you a story through their camera, while others feel as if they have to make the story with the camera.  I really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized, which is as an eyeball through which we all see.4.  Lighting, cinematography, and editing?  Great all around.  I have already wrote so much, and I could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs, so I will just wrap it up.In short, go see this movie.  Do not listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it, especially if they are so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 14 of the way through their post.  Enjoy the show!  Ben",

		"Somewhat funny and wellpaced action thriller that has Jamie Foxx as a hapless, fasttalking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding U.S.  Treasury Agent David Morse to be released on the streets of New York to find a picky computer thiefhacker Doug Hutchinson, who stole fortytwo million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead.Bait marks the sophomore feature for Antoine Fuqua The Replacement Killers and he handles the task fairly well even though it does not top his first movie.  What the two films have in common is the action sequences, which are flatout excellent.Foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning, but throughout the film, I began to catch on.  Hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as John Malkovich and patient as the late Laurence Olivier was in Marathon Man.  Morse did it",
		"This tale based on two Edgar Allen Poe pieces The Fall of the House of Usher, Dance of Death poem  is actually quite creepy from beginning to end.  It is similar to some of the old blackandwhite movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house for example, The Cat and the Canary, The Old Dark House, Night of Terror and so on.  Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of lifesize dolls that terrorize the guests.  He does he and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences.  I will not go into too much detail here, but it is definitely a mustsee for fans of old dark house mysteries.Watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room.Dan Basinger 810",
		"This has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen.  The giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre.  This unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story.  The casts is outstanding, including TOM BOSLEY who as far as I know never has been in a horror movie before, ever.  The effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one.  My one complaint, I just wish we saw more of the giant mummy, but other then that I think they did a great job.  The dialog, the characters and the story was perfect.  The acting was wonderful.  This has got to be the best movie to come out of the scifi channel.  You heard me I give THE FALLEN ONES 9 OUT OF 10.",
		"Without Kirsten Miller this project need not have been completed.  However with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is Miss Miller I would definitely recommend it.  It looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance.  Wagners dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes did not detract from being entertained.  Mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line, the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster.  The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable.  She plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be.  I wish I",

		"Just two comments....SEVEN years apart?  Hardly evidence of the films relentless pullingpower!  As has been mentioned, the lowbudget telemovie status of 13 GANTRY ROW is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal.  Having said that however the thing is not without merit  either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se.True, the plot at its most basic is a reworking of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR  only without much horror.  More a case of intrigue!  Gibney played Halifax The script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard.  It just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments.Having picked the DVD up for a mere 3.95 last week at my regular video store, I cannot begrudge the expenditure. 10.95 would be an acceptable price for the film.

		"What is inexplicable?  Firstly, the hatred towards this movie.  It gim me It is a damn good movie.  Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it.  I have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when I saw it in theaters.  I have rewatched it on TV and video, and it had none of the impact it had when I saw it on the big screen twice, or maybe three times, actually.  But that might be it, the appeal of it.  It is a Movie, yes, capital M there, it is an Epic, it is a spectacle in the order of Gone With the Wind or Ben Hur.  Now, Ben Hur and Gone With the Wind seem kinda hokey to me, with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama.  Not that Titanic has none of that.  Well, the acting was actually very good.  The melodrama was quite heavyhanded at times.But the reason Titanic works is that it is such an emotional ride.  I usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind, or give me a visual thrill.  This movie is not exactly dumb, but it is not cerebral at all.  The visual thrills are simply means to an end, to fuel the emotions of the audience.  I did not cry when Bambis mom died, I do not react to tearjerkers.  But this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million, an emotional rollercoaster that, if it were a regular one, would make Buzz Aldrin scream like a little girl.  And I am sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it, and have a ready supply of cynicism, then you can thoroughly dislike this movie.  But if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit, if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt, you will enjoy it completely.  And look at the top ten grossing films of all time.  Is a single one of them bad?  Is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10?  No, not even The Phantom Menace.  And this movie made 1.8 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide.  It cannot be bad.  Not possible. 1010.p.s. how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman?  spiderman was a fun movie, but it was a total 911 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did. it simply was not anything all that special. no one will remember it in 50 years. but i am pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.",

		"Previously, I wrote that I loved Titanic, cried at its ending many times over, and I am a guy in his 60s.  I also wondered about why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users.Well, I looked at the breakdown of the user ratings.  While 29.0 of all votes gave it a 10 rating, 10.7 gave it a 1 rating.  These 10.7 of these irrational imdb users, in effect, pulled the overall rating down to 7.0.  In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in 1 ratings, with a high 10 rating, dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level on only one thing hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio.  Believe me, I have tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men, mostly, who defame him left and right.  They giving him To answer one other user I am NOT talking about someone who just really does not like the movie that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc.  Everyone has, and is entitled to, hisher own taste.  But no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for Titanic, pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of Titanic to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point.  Heavens Gate 1980 was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing, and imdb voters ratings were 23.2 10 ratings and 9.2 1 ratings overall rating of 6.1.  Big Top Peewee 1988 got 4.3 10 ratings and 9.9 1 ratings overall rating of 4.5.  Cat People 1982 got 6.1 10 ratings and 2.6 1 ratings overall rating of 5.8.  Blind Date 1987 got 3.0 10 ratings and 2.8 1 ratings overall rating of 5.3.  Jumpin Jack Flash 1986 got 4.4 10 ratings and 3.7 1 ratings overall rating of 5.2.  WHAT DO ALL OF THESE FILMS HAVE IN COMMON WITH TITANIC?  ALL OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE LOWER !!!!  THAN TITANIC, AND NONE OF THESE STINKERS EVER WAS NOMINATED FOR A SINGLE AWARD.  Again, Titanic got 10.7 1 ratings!  Compare that to the other 5 movies I just mentioned.Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo factor?",

A simple disaster film boring to watch converted to an unbelievable romance.  Yes I am not the Romance type either, but that should not bother you, because you will never see a romance like this.  Guaranteed!  Everything to the amazing effects, to the music, to the sublime acting.  The movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling.  Everything looks very real and live.

		"I saying it True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly.  I do not think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent.  The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus.  Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose.  David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he is in.  The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow.  The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank.  I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving.  The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On.  The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies.  Overall, I give Titanic an 8.510.  Bethany Cox.",

Well James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship.  Well, onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film.So our two main characters are Jack Leonardo DiCaprio and Rose Kate Winslet.  They are not annoying too much but watch this and you will find out why they could become annoying  httptinyurl.comojhoyn .  The main villain I guess is bad luck, fate, hand of God no blasphemy intended, or just plain Caledon Hockley Billy Zane.  Combine all of the above and what do you get?!  Oh yes!  We get a love story on a sinking boat.  The supporting characters are the following My personal favorite, Mr.  Andrews Victor Garberidk he was so nice, LovejoyDavid Warner, MurdochEwan Stewart, Lightoller Jonathan Phillips, Captain SmithBernard Hill, Molly BrownKathy Bates, and many more.  We also got the present day treasure hunter, Brock Lovett Bill Paxton.  They add something to the story, something good.  The action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good.  In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears.  The story is simple and it works.  A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond.  She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic.  Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship.  Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws.  I give Titanic, an 86 awesome",

They are not annoying too much but watch this and you will find out why they could become annoying  httptinyurl.comojhoyn .  The main villain I guess is bad luck, fate, hand of God no blasphemy intended, or just plain Caledon Hockley Billy Zane.  Combine all of the above and what do you get?!  Oh yes!  We get a love story on a sinking boat.  The supporting characters are the following My personal favorite, Mr.  Andrews Victor Garberidk he was so nice, LovejoyDavid Warner, MurdochEwan Stewart, Lightoller Jonathan Phillips, Captain SmithBernard Hill, Molly BrownKathy Bates, and many more.  We also got the present day treasure hunter, Brock Lovett Bill Paxton.  They add something The action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good.  In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears.  The story is simple and it works.  A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond.  She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic.  Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship.  Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws.  I give Titanic, an 86 awesome",
		"I think James Cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies.  Anyway, everyone remembers the RMS Titanic.  It was big, fast, and unsinkable... until April 1912.  It was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever.

		"Titanic takes place WriterDirector James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic.  The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.  They make for a good onscreen couple.  DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable.  They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well.  The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film.  The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time.  The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation.  The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it is few flaws.  Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it.  The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg.  Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the illfated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.",

		"The ship may have sunk but the movie did not!!!  Director did it One of my favorite scenes is The Dinner table scene, in which Roses family and friends meet Jack after he saves her.  Rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet THE ONE...I hope I have that look when I am in the room with my future husband.Jack and Rose have a connection that is MOVIE STUFF but it is good movie stuff.  We have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth.  Rose almost commits suicide but the Gilbert Grape star rescues her.  I really liked the hanging over the boat scene.  It was a good risk.The movie is long but it is fantastic!!!  Good story, good flow, good actors!!!  Go see it twice if you want, Its worth it!!!",

		"Titanic has to be one of my alltime favorite movies.  It has its I know so many people who do not like this movie, and I am not saying I do not see why.  The love story is too cheesy well, yes but is not it enjoyable and moving?  All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this does not actually exist.  But this is a movie, does not everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while?  The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors.  Well, OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials.  However I think it is unfair to say that they are terrible actors.  I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in.  But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.And finally, if one is going to complain that they do not like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I am sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things.  It is like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies.  Simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this IS a good movie.Well deserving of its Oscars, in particular, Best Cinematography, which I find to be the best I have ever seen in a movie save maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogy.I know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each others names throughout the movie.  The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it is an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults.  The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.I give this movie 1010, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it is an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.",

		"Titanic is a classic.  I was really surprised that this movie did not have a solid ten, overall in the IMDb user rankings.  Maybe, it is just cool to not give Titanic credit nowadays, but when it was first made it was really something.  When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters.  When it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month.  It say we Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot, like the frozen baby, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd.  Many people died on that ship, and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that James Cameron stepped up to.  And let us not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose.  Whether or not their relationship was a figment of someones imagination it was lovely.  They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other.  They trusted each other.  They sure as hell are giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money.  I will never let go, Jack.  Titanic is a great film down to it is very core.  It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music, and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers.  It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie.",

		"For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time.  No exceptions.  James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller.  Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and sciencefiction goes.  He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film.  But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance.  The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows.  The story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a truthful, interesting and entertaining film about it.  The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters are not given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly Rose Gloria Stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is Roses and Jacks story alone, no one else.  Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home.  The music has become iconic and legendary.  It is composer The song after so long has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is.  Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside.  James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime.  My heart will not go on from this one.",
		"Back in 1997, do I remember that year Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets.  This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster.  I think anybody It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful.  At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and did not watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now.  Was it worth the hype?  Was it really the best movie of all time?  Was that Leonardos real nose?  OK, I know that is silly to say, but I did rewatch the film.  Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, best movie of all time, no, just depends on your idea of a good movie, but Titanic delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean.  Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude, wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101yearold Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing.  She and her granddaughter Elizabeth Lizzy Calvert visit Lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship.  When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater.  In 1912, the upperclass 17yearold Rose boards the ship with her fianc?, Cal Hockley and her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, both of whom stress the importance of Roses engagement to Cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the DewittBukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upperclass, Rose and her mother are financially broke.  Distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling Cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern.  Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes.  Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy firstclass formal dinner of the rapportbuilding wealthy for a much livelier gathering of Irish dance, music and beer in thirdclass.  But after Cals servant informs him of Roses whereabouts, Rose is forbidden from seeing Jack again.  However, after witnessing a woman encouraging her sevenyearold daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea, Rose defies him and her mother, asking Jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the Heart of the Ocean, an engagement present from Cal.  After a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time, they go to the deck of the ship.They then witness the ships fatal collision with an iceberg.  After overhearing the ships lookouts discussing how serious the collision is, Rose tells Jack they should warn her mother and Cal.  Meanwhile, Cal discovers Roses nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe, so he frames Jack for stealing the Heart of the Ocean by having Lovejoy plant it in Jacks pocket.  Upon learning Cal intends to leave Jack to die below deck, Rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him.  Jack and Rose return to the top deck.  Cal and Jack, though enemies, both want Rose safe, so they persuade her to board a lifeboat.  But after realizing that she cannot leave Jack, Rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with Jack in the ships first class staircase.  Jack and Rose return to the top deck, the lifeboats have gone, and the ship finally goes down into the freezing Atlantic taking Jack and Rose down.So does Titanic live up to it is hype?  I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie.  But it has great acting, amazing effects, a wellwritten story and still looks flawless.  Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie did not get a lot of hype just because of Leos baby face or Kates amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special.  It will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too seeing that I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released.  But all that aside, I do recommend this movie, it is a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.1010",

It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful.  At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and did not watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now.  Was it worth the hype?  Was it really the best movie of all time?  Was that Leonardos real nose?  OK, I know that is silly to say, but I did rewatch the film.  Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, best movie of all time, no, just depends on your idea of a good movie, but Titanic delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean.  Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude, wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101yearold Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing.  She and her granddaughter Elizabeth Lizzy Calvert visit Lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship.  When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater.  In 1912, the upperclass 17yearold Rose boards the ship with her fianc?, Cal Hockley and her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, both of whom stress the importance of Roses engagement to Cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the DewittBukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upperclass, Rose and her mother are financially broke.  Distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling Cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern.  Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes.  Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy firstclass formal dinner of the rapportbuilding wealthy for a much livelier gathering of Irish dance, music and beer in thirdclass.  But after Cals servant informs him of Roses whereabouts, Rose is forbidden from seeing Jack again.  However, after witnessing a woman encouraging her sevenyearold daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea, Rose defies him and her mother, asking Jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the Heart of the Ocean, an engagement present from Cal.  After a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time, they go to the deck of the ship.They then witness the ships fatal collision with an iceberg.  After overhearing the ships lookouts discussing how serious the collision is, Rose tells Jack they should warn her mother and Cal.  Meanwhile, Cal discovers Roses nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe, so he frames Jack for stealing the Heart of the Ocean by having Lovejoy plant it in Jacks pocket.  Upon learning Cal intends to leave Jack to die below deck, Rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him.  Jack and Rose return to the top deck.  Cal want Rose But after realizing that she cannot leave Jack, Rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with Jack in the ships first class staircase.  Jack and Rose return to the top deck, the lifeboats have gone, and the ship finally goes down into the freezing Atlantic taking Jack and Rose down.So does Titanic live up to it is hype?  I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie.  But it has great acting, amazing effects, a wellwritten story and still looks flawless.  Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie did not get a lot of hype just because of Leos baby face or Kates amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special.  It will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too seeing that I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released.  But all that aside, I do recommend this movie, it is a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.1010",

		"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense.  The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal Billy Zane.  Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack Leonardo DiCaprio, a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She telling her With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York.  Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson.  Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanics legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 1139, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanics many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too.  The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanics officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaires Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown.  As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss.  Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs.  Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr.  Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat.  In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware.  The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the PostVictorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to new money such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes.  Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes.  Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society.  Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.  The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives.  Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night.  In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.  At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic.  Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it does not take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture.  Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing.  If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.",

		"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense.  The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal Billy Zane.  Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack Leonardo DiCaprio, a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York.  Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson.  Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanics legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 1139, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.

The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanics many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too.  The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.

One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York.  Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson.  Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanics legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 1139, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanics many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too.  The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanics officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaires Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown.  As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss.  Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs.  Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr.  Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat.  In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware.  The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the PostVictorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to new money such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes.  Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes.  Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society.  Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.  The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives.  Everyone gets you In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.  At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic.  Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it does not take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture.  Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing.  If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.",
		"I find it Obviously this movie was not THAT bad or else people would not even BOTHER to talk about it.  I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do!  I guess this film is not for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many.  As for those that think that this film is overrated or overhyped...well, we only have the moviegoing public to thank for that!  lol You see, it is not CRITICSarticle writers that make a film HUGE or a HIT with the general moviegoing public.  PEOPLE make the film a huge success.  With Titanic, everyone was in awe.  Let us face it, a film like this had never been made before.  At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking.  This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912.  Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched!  Give this movie a break you guys!  The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time!  When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you that this was a gooddecentmovie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more!  So, I really would not say that this movie was overhyped...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being overhyped. ha!  Critics did not even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Camerons gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film.  However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more!  Personally, I LOVE this film.  However, this film might not be for everyone.  Do not say that this film sucks just because of romance though!  THat is the most sexist thing I have ever heard!  Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it!  The story was sweet.  The dialogue could have been better, but let us face it...the REAL star of the movie was not Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship!  I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job.  It is not thier best work I have seen much BETTER work from both of them but it was not the WORST I have seen on screen before.  Give them a break!",

The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.

Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years.  I cried again.... in all the same places.  It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time.  A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall yes, even more than Star Wars.  And today, many people will not even admit they enjoyed it.  Folks, let us get something straight  you do not look cool when you badmouth this film.  You look like an out of touch cynic.No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults.  Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly.  However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful.  Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation.  Wait til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy.  Kate Winslet was so strong in this film.  The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic.  The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night.  How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me.  I was utterly transfixed.This film is one memorable scene after another.  Titanic leaving port in Southampton.  Rose and Jack at the bow, flying.  Iceberg, right ahead!  The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean.  The screams of the doomed after she went down.  And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.The music, which has also been a victim of the films success, was a key ingredient.  James Horners score was simply perfect.  And the love theme was beautiful and tragic.  Too bad Celine Dions pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.I confess, I am a Titanic buff.  As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it  in all its beauty.  Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I have had such an interest in the ship all my life.  However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs.  I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy.

I am sorry for those that do not understand the value of love, family and friendship.It was very interesting to watch Patrick Duffy in a different role than that of Bobby Ewing.  And it is great to see a 19 year old Ben Affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance.  He showed at an early age, that he is capable of heartfelt drama.  He should be offered more serious roles.  Note Hollywoodland... his first serious role in years and he went out and won Best Actor at the Venice Festival in 2006.This movie can be appreciated by people of all ages.  Maybe should not be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families, but I recommend it to the entire family.I bought this movie on DVD and have watched it with friends many times.  Because it portrays the values that are important in life.",

		"After a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted, urban, turn of the century Australian street, we meet Julie Rebecca Gibney and Peter John Adam as they go out house hunting.  They manage to get a loan for a fixerupper on a posh Sydney street, but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home.  It just may be haunted.13 Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clich?d story with good to average direction by Catherine Millar into a slightly above average shocker.The biggest flaws seem partially due to budget, but not wholly excusable to that hurdle.  A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film.  The opening thriller scene features some wonky editing.  Freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there is not much action.  Suspense should be created from staging, not fancy fix it in the mix techniques.  There is great atmosphere in the scene from the location, the lighting, the fog and such, but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim, cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street, showing their increasing proximity.  The tracking and the cuts need to be slow.  The attack needed to be longer, clearer and better blocked.  As it stands, the scene has a strong made for television feel, and a low budget one at that.After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves.  The story has a lot of similarities to The Amityville Horror 1979, though the budget forces a much subtler approach.  Millar and scriptwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios, often dramatic in nature instead of special effectsoriented, such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron, which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall.For some horror fans, the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama.  At least the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in.  But Morphett writes fine, intelligent dialogue.  The material is done well enough that it is often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise laterespecially if you have gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house.Once they get settled and things begin to get weirder, even though the special effects often leave much to be desired, the ideas are good.  The performances help create tension.  There is not an abundance of death and destruction in the filmthere is more of an abundance of home repair nightmares.  But neither menace is really the point.The point is human relationships.  There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting.  The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it.  That it is in a posh neighborhood, and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies, shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe, such as money or health problems.  Peters character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal workbased friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive, scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful.  At the same time, we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be.  Julie finds liberation Anyone fond of haunted house films, psycho films or horrorthrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy.  It certainly is not worth spending 30 for a DVD that was the price my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling, but it is worth a rental, and it is definitely worth watching for free.",

At the same time, we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be.  Julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown, but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship.Although 13 Gantry Row never quite transcends its madefortelevision clunkiness, as a TV movie, this is a pretty good one, with admirable ambitions.  Anyone fond of haunted house films, psycho films or horrorthrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy.  It showed it",
		"Daniell Steels Daddy, what a refreshing story.  This movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children.  How rare is that?  In these times of Heather has two Mommies or what ever, you fill in the blanks it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone.  With the fathers roles being prominent I was hoping this would be another Daniell Steel Saga.  How disappointing to have it end.  Every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role.  I would have loved to see each character develop over the years.  I loved this movie, it is one I will defiantly watch every time it is on.  Good story, good acting, and I hope this is not a spoiler, but no obtrusive sex or bad language.  Yes it touched my heart.  Warning, get the Kleenex ready.  What I find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment, be it Television or.  Movies.  Daniell give us",

		"I must admit, when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as Steamy Romance I was a little bit skeptical.  Steamy?  In a movie from 1968??  I was prepared for disappointment.  And when I realized it was shot entirely in black  white, I knew my erotic hopes were dashed.Boy, was I wrong!  Not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance  the discovery of first love, fear of the secret being found out, a sudden unexpected end  but at times this movie was downright erotic.  You will soon forget that it is shot in black  white.  The cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years.  And the performances from the two stars Essy Persson and Anna Gael are intense and memorable.  OK, so they are both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls.  It is 1968.  Do you really expect teenagers from the 60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this?  Many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then.  Anyone was way The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination, opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown.I have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here.  As for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action Although it will not be all you expect, I do not think you will be too, too disappointed.",

		"I admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of hisher reluctant guardian.  I have seen enough of them  Baby Boom, Kolya, About a Boy, Mostly Martha, and to some extent, Whale Rider  to expect to be bored by the formula.  What held my attention in The King of Masks was the grimness of the setting smalltown China in the 1930s.  Extreme poverty was the norm, and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market.  When Wang discovers his purchased grandson, whom he is nicknamed Doggie, is a granddaughter, he initially casts her out, even though she is showed great promise as streetperforming heir.  Even after he reluctantly takes her back, he is not too upset when she is kidnapped.  The film is gritty then, showing the lengths to which a young, streetsmart girl had to go to survive in that society.The two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context.  In a Western society, one would expect at least a hint of resentment from Wang at not having achieved more material success.  Wang accepts his While Doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern, suburban child, it is completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage.  And after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her, her fierce attachment to Wang makes perfect sense.The peek at smalltown life in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two lead actors, the surprising plot twists, and of course, the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film.",

Liang is worried that a precious art should not die with Wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to Wangs mind.  The film is about prejudices, male domination, state of art, values and most importantly warmth.I cannot recommend this film enough.  The whole film is in loops.  Everything has a significance.

		"This is a superb movie, suitable for all but the very youngest, though accessibility for younger people was marred at least in the print which I saw by the use of some unfortunate choice of English subtitling!  For much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which timeperiod it is set  there is no modern technology shown, not even the ubiquitous Chinese bicycle, just a drab, almost monochrome, everyday life, against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the Sezuan Opera and of celebratory fireworks.  Even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war, this could still be any time in the past 150 years.But then we briefly see a motor car  late 30s, early 40s style  and we realise that we are watching a China on the verge of huge upheavals, and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of World War 2 and the Communist revolution.Which makes the central characters desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant.But the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today, both within China and in other parts of the world the inequality between boys and girls, men and women; the trade, for various purposes, in young children; corruption in society; injustice; the importance of friendship.Maybe I am reading too much into this film; but I do not think so!  I get me",

He does it He has a longing desire to have a grandson, as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir.  We then go to the streets, and see that people are selling their children because they cannot afford to take care of them some are even begging to take their daughters for free, because daughters are not worth much in this society.  Wang Bianlians story goes on from there.The film was so astonishingly good, the acting was amazing, and the issues were so weighty and welladdressed.  There is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place, no one wants a little girl.  Also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the Living Bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman, and while he is famous and wellrespected, he regards himself as something low, a half woman.  As we go further into the film, the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it, the brutality and corruption of the military and police, and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions.This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Wang Bianlian, presents yet another beautiful performance.",

		"One of the great things about many of the superb Chinese movies you can find, if you are lucky, in the video stores, is they are very accurate retellings of actual, true stories.  Farewell, my Concubine, The Emperor and the Assassin and this movie are perfect examples.  The film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience  the hallmark of much Hollywood, and especially Disney films.In this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the King of Masks for his mastery of Sichuan Change Art.  Along an having lost his only son many years earlier, he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work.  Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader.  All is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art.  But the son eventually is found out to be a girl.  From there, the story get very interesting, with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera  a regional operatic style related to Peking Opera.  Fans of Farewell My Concubine should look carefully at Master Liangs portrayal of a male playing the female role in Chinese Opera.  It help them",

From there, we follow them through the rigors of their challenging, but free life along the river.  Traveling town to town, he performs and has some degree of notoriety.  Despite the times and the influences, the man is kind and good.Overall, the performances are first rate, especially Xu Zhu, who portrays the street performer.  The child Renying Zhou is beautiful, and downright strong, and withstands the overt prejudices well.  The two protagonists, along with supporting help from the kind opera singer, Master Liang an interestingly androgynous Zhao Zhigang, paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness, sadness and love.  Some have mentioned this films remote similarities to BA WANG BIE JI FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE; yet this film cannot stand easily on its own, any resemblance is remote at best.My only qualm with the KING OF MASKS, is the ending.  It was weak, cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer.  The audience was already wrapped up in the story, what was the needless manipulation for?  What a shame.  To bring a fine motion picture that far, only to surrender to emotional and corny pathos like that.  It frankly made this film good, instead of the classic, it should have been.  That aside, the KING OF MASKS is still very well worth your time.  I was happy to see the Shaw Brothers are still producing good films.  Highly recommended.",

Most, if not all, of these cops are borderline?  psychopaths and neurotics, giving new meaning to the phrase loose cannons.Equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries, terrorist Buaku and his henchwomen, the Twin Cat Sisters, whose existence always seems to involve giving the Tank Police a hard time.The animation is not state of the art, but it is very nice otherwise; the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of Dominion.The English dubbing is, again, lots of fun.

		"Fact Stargate SG1 is a cheesy scifi TV series.There is no escaping facts.  How much you try to excuse yourself or explain it Stargate SG1 remains a cheesy scifi TV series.Stargate SG1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly.  Special FX are not nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action is not going to blow you out of the chair.  Or couch for that matter either.But, and this is where I really think Stargate SG1 deserves all the credit it can get, for each and every episode or stolen idea I think you can count at least one cheesy scifi movie that is actually worse than a one hour TV episode.In fact some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still have been better than most movies.And being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes Stargate SG1 special.I am very picky with my selections.

		"Scott Bartletts OffOn is nine minutes of pure craziness.  It flashing lights There is no story to speak of, but Bartlett uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions, integrating these biological phenomena into the highlyindustrial form of modern technology.  In a sense, the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools, his machinery, his technology.  This theme connects loosely with the subplot of HAL9000 in Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968, and, indeed, Bartletts opening sequence of images  flashing colours before a closeup human eye  recalls Dave Bowmans journey through the Stargate.  The visuals are richlycoloured, a confronting blend of sharp, vivid photography and increasinglygrainy video, as though we are sitting too close to a television screen {as a matter of fact, the end product was recorded from a TV monitor}.There appears to be some confusion about the films release date.  IMDb lists the film as a 1972 release, but both the National Film Registry and the National Film Preservation Foundation give 1968 as the correct year.  Perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the films completion and its first public screening.  Either way, the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time, occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video, and some brisk techno music would not have gone amiss, either!  OffOn captures grainy, fragmented images, presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information.  I had a thought  and please do not laugh at this freethinking interpretation  that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing Earths television signals might very well receive such a disjointed, alien documentation of human life, a bizarre montage of only vaguelyfamiliar imagery that could not possibly make any coherent sense.  Perhaps this is where Mankind, with all his technology, is eventually heading, towards an irreversible merging of film and video, of purity and artificiality.",

They were even better than I had experienced at first.My only complaint is that while the Tank Police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime, warranting tanks and heavy artillery, it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals.  That is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time.  If that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda, it certainly has not been shown as such.I do not think the original Japanese version could have been any where as good as the Americanized version of this.

Hugh OBrien plays the face, Buddy Hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to Lou Costello and thus, Abbott and Costello replacing the leads.  Do not know if that was true.all in all, a pleasant movie, but important to have that much Spike Jones and his band on film for history.  Wish that it was released, as I have not seen or heard of it now in two decades.  Hope it is not lost",

		"The performance by Om Puri, Smita Patil, and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely, along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by Govind Nihlani.  The dialogues by Vijay Tendulkar is also great.  I have not seen another movie like this.  It is one whole, each piece so nicely fit in the plot.  You cannot not be impressed by this movie.  Amrish Puri comes off as the bossy husband and baap of Om Puri.  Om Puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system.  Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain.  The first meeting of Anand Velankar with Rama Shettys at Sadhashivs place is absoulely stunning.  Smita Patil does not play a main role, but her part is also not distracting from the main plot.  And to add to this all Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings.  Saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble.  He helps him Om Puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya.  A treat to all avid fans of Indian cinema.",

It was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released.  This movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood likeCOOLIE, BETAAB,HERO in 1983.SmithaPatel, in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him.  She won him The anger which left half handedly continued in Govind Nihalanis other film Drohkaal.  Even after two decades, this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew.

There are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion.  Its amazing, season after season the show gets better and better.I have been a fan of MacGyver since i was 5 19 now and i find it so ironic that my 2 favorite TV shows of all time star Richard Dean Anderson.  Its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other.Back when i first saw Stargate the movie, i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite scifi flicks, then hearing a TV show would spin from it i got really excited, but did not get showtime till the fifth season was almost over.Though, I am disappointed to hear that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio optioned the series instead.  Id say though that it turned out just fine.  Maybe even better.This show is amazing, and i hope it never dies.  Atlantis here we come!",

At the end of the film, Om Puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem.The film tries mighty hard to do a oneup on the poem.

I surrounded himself There are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of Wood, and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary.  Overall, it is worth a watch for the Wood fan and those of cinema in general, but do not expect brilliance here.  Expect a documentary made after Woods own heart.",

They include Vampira Interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations.  It is interesting somewhat but was this really needed?

		"I loved this film.  Not being a swooning Ed Wood Jr. fan, I prefer to appreciate his boundless enthusiasm and acknowledge his shortcomings.  His movies are fun, but his personal story is one racked with pain.  I understanding his From beginning to end, this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology, leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to Ed Wood Jr.What we get are people who knew Ed Wood the best talking about him from all perspectives, positive and negative, and showing us their character as much as Eds.  We get insight into Eds personal and professional life from his romances, to his drinking, to his sexuality, to his friends, to his enemies, and even to his film making.The film itself is shot in a lowbudget way that seems done out of respect for Ed, as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the President.  The set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background.Fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding Ed Wood controversies, and new comers will be amazed that this man was real.  The DVD is full of impossible to find gems Crossroads of Lorado and photo galleries, but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story.Ed Wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him for better or worse, to the point where one woman will go down in history as Swimming Pool Owner for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool.  This ability to define a persons legacy comes through universally, as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was Ed Wood Jr., but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created.  Somehow, without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time, the connection that Ed Wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement.Even the title hints at the Blist horror genre, but by the end, we see that even this is a kindness.  What begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with Woods legend.In many ways a living contradiction, Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed to a single viewpoint.  This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get.  Being itself a juxtaposition of themes, it is at once respectful, provocative, thoughtful, gripping, fun, sad, kind, and fulfilling.",

The best chance of seeing this film outside a Takashi Miike retrospective at a film festival is on DVD.  If I have not put you off try hunting for a Hong Kong version on the web as I am sure it will come out in that country.",
		"Shinjuku Triad Society, albeit from perfect, is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uberconventional realm.  It involving cops Social issues like black market trading of precious goods, in this case human organs usually from children; nostalgia for childhood and ones roots, which was especially prevalent in Dead or Alive 2; thumbingofthenose at taboos like gay sex and satirical rapeviolence towards women; bloodcurdling violence.  It is certainly not as surreal as some of Miikes most recent films, but this is expected as he is trying out things that he is just starting to learn, following a track record of straight to video programmers.  It is got all of those qualities, and it is also, like the films that would follow from it, equally savage and heartfelt, crazy in spots and sardonic in its drama, and solid for genre fans.The story concerns two brothers, one a Chinese orphan raised in Japan, Tatsuhito Kiriya Kippei Shiina, pretty decent as a Eastwoodesquire antiherohero, who is become a detective, and another, who is become a gangster, or a wouldbe one.  The main arch likely takeover gang comes from Wang a definite pun on what the gang represents during its sparetime, played by Tomorowo Taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes, and his partner Karino Takeshi Caesar, who is threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who is just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal, who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a Miike movie.  There is some intrigue involving the organtrading scheme with the gangsters, which Kiriya almost becomes a victim of, and the gangs penchant for gay sex at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want.  It all leads up to vengeance and redemption, qualities that Miike and his writer are trying to emulate from Shakespeare hence the Macbeth bit with Wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying it will not come off.If it does not add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great Shakespeare play would have, it is par for the course of a film like this.  Miikes goals are met, though just met, in his lowscale ambitions a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents, notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime, and what the realm of unrepentant sex, with both sexes, brings out psychologically in the characters.  At the same time, Shinjuku Triad Society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting blackcomedy from the Miike oeuvre.  Some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness, like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face, or the randomness of the interrogation as it goes into a very twisted area.  There is even a laughoutloud line from the young sexslave after finishing an act on one of the bosses Thank you, Mr.  WeenyBurger.  Miike and his writer do not have enough here to make the film a fullon dark comedy like Ichi or, of course, Visitor Q, but there is enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters.As the first entry of the Black Society trilogy, as it is called, I was quite impressed, and it is a fine quasicalling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema.",
		"Shinjuku Triad Society, albeit from perfect, is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uberconventional realm.

		"This movie is the first of Miikes triad society trilogy, and the trilogy kicks of to a great start.  The movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically, and these themes are actually apparent in all his films, if you look close enough.  Shinjuku Triad Society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders, struggling their way to the top of Tokyos yakuza.  The kid brother is a lawyer, and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one, as the movie progresses.  The movie takes place in a very harsh environment, and is therefore pretty violent and tough.  Miike hits you As usual there is also a lot of perverted sex, mostly homosexual in this one.  The movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie, but with a great drive and true grittiness.  If you have only seen Miikes farout movies Ichi the killer, Fudoh etc. this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive overthetop style displayed in those movies and his more serious side, as seen in the other films of the trilogy.  And as always with Miike, there are at least two scenes in this that you will NEVER forget see it and figure out which ones for yourself.810",
		"A lot has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true Miike film and I thought this sort of description might have been a clich?.  But, like all clich?s, it is based on the truth.  All the Miike trademarks are here, the violence, the black humour, the homosexuality, the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character.  Shinjuku is however, one of Miikes most perfectly formed films.  He made it I think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film.  As you might expect, the violence is utterly visceral, gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face.  Only a Miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that.  The film has a fantastic pace, unlike Dead or Alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle.  Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues, Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here, the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past.  I cannot sing Shinjukus praises enough.  I do not want to give away too much.  This is Miike before he began to use CGI to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitanos Sonatine.  The central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you will be popping it back on again to work it all out.",

		"Here it is.. the first EVER episode of Friends, Where we get introduced to Control Freak Monica Gellar Courtney Cox, Newly divorced Ross Gellar David Schimmer, Hippy Pheobe Buffay Lisa Kudrow, unknown actor and ladies man Matt Le Blanc and very sarcastic Chandler Bing Matthew Perry.  This is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the 6th and final friend Spoilt kid Rachel Green Jennifer Aniston.The Episode is better than most people give credit for, like any new sitcom the first episode is not always fantastic.  The acting in this episode is not great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters apart from Kudrow and Perry who shine.Matt Le Blanc Man, his acting was down right dreadful because until later, he gets more confident, but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails.David Schimmer Why does he over pronounce EVERY word?  he cannot speak normally!  but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons, but he is not confident. and i cannot sympathise with him Jennifer Aniston Looks hot, and does a good job as Rachel Green, but we only see the real Rachel later in the 1st season, Courtney Cox Looks quite anorexic in this episode, its worrying, she looks totally different now, more healthily, she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this 20 minute pilot!  Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry I am doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb, and for Lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as Pheobe Pheebs and Matthew Perry is just Matthew Perry playing himself basically!  The episode quality does improve later,,, such as the Sets, they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly, the acting is OK, the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot!  I hope we cause they will always be there for us!",
		"The pilot is extremely well done.  It lays out how the characters bond in future episodes.  I think anyone It displays remarkable creativity on the writers part.  Although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode, a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot.  An example would be Ross and Rachels future relationship.  Even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared, it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice.Bravo.A great start to an unbeatable comedy!",
		"In the very first episode of Friends, which aired 22 Sept 1994 The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate there is a song playing as Rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show, the line that plays is If you ever need holding.... does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song?  It is seems as if it is a great song....I would love to get a copy of it.  Thanks for the assistance.

He killem all, they are often the victims Screwfly solution, Prolife, Valerie on the stairs, I do not remember the Argentos episode in season 1, etc., obviously Imprint.  I think he Never least Right to die is one of the best, with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense specially with the photos from the cell scene, wonderful.  The acting is like the entire series, regular I could be worst like Prolife or We scream for Ice cream.  Also I think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode.  The ideology of the series is horrible, killing and terminating women, mutilating animals and on and on... the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like Cigarrette burns The best of all, Homecoming The most funny, Imprint really shocking.",
		"Well its about time.  I had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this seasons entries.  While there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries, at least this episode turned out well.  Its rather funny that director Rob Schmidt who only has the not bad Wrong Turn to his credit and writer John Esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season.  In Right To Die we are treated to the story of Cliff and Abbey.  At the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation.  Abbey win her While they speak, they find themselves in a car accident where Cliff is left with only scratches and bruises, but Abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire.  And this is just the setup people.  Once in the hospital Cliff must decide whether or not Abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes.  There is also a side effect too.  Every time she flatlines, Abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people.  Hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever.  From the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists I never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it, Right To Die should have the right to go on living forever.",
		"A man and his wife get in a horrible car accident.  When the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state, the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live.  The decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him.This comes to us from director Rob Schmidt, who made Wrong Turn a film I have not seen.  With only one horror film under his belt, and not a particularly notorious one at that, I was a bit reluctant to watch this episode, expecting Schmidt to be a Master of Horror in only the most liberal sense.  My apologies to him for my underestimation.  As of episode 10 in a 13 episode season, this was actually the best one yet.The issue of the right to die is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device.  However, this is only the foundation on which the story revolves.  Once the horror elements show up, the film goes from decent to spectacular.  Great acting, great plot, great dialogue, great suspense.  I was a little creeped out at times which is good and most of all the gore is in extreme abundance!  I watching it Through the first part of the show, I had no idea what they were talking about.  Then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of Hellraiser 2.  However, I in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film.  I can see no other way to create the effect that was created, and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than Hellraiser 2.Some plot twists show up later on, and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look.  I did not watch it a second time, but I think the beginning would make more sense if I had not that it is confusing.  The subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice, and I found myself going back and forth about whether I disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if I felt bad for him.  He is somewhat of an antihero to the whole story, if you will.  I feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist, but he is completely unlovable.While the Stuart Gordon episode may be better and I am excited about the Washingtonians episode, I think I could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine.  When legends like John Carpenter let me down again I get a bit worried about the genres future, but then a fresh face like Rob Schmidt comes along and gives me hope.  This one is a keeper, and please bring Schmidt back for season 3!",

I did not watch it a second time, but I think the beginning would make more sense if I had not that it is confusing.  The subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice, and I found myself going back and forth about whether I disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if I felt bad for him.  He is somewhat of an antihero to the whole story, if you will.  I think I When legends like John Carpenter let me down again I get a bit worried about the genres future, but then a fresh face like Rob Schmidt comes along and gives me hope.  This one is a keeper, and please bring Schmidt back for season 3!",
		"Fans of the HBO series Tales From the Crypt are going to love this MOH episode.  Those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic EC comics were based on, will recognize this one right off the bat.Underrated indie favorite Martin Donovan also an excellent writer  coauthor of the screenplays for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOMES HER is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way.  He could play a really nice if misunderstood guynextdoor, or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness.  In the case of RIGHT TO DIE, he takes the latter approach, and it definitely works.Donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist Robin Sydney, much to the displeasure of his inconsolable, unforgiving spouse, Abbey Julia Anderson.  When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of making up, and she is horribly burned in a fire, he is reluctant to pull the plug on her, not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy Corbin Bernsen, looking the worse for wear these days.  But Abbeys never been one to give up without a fight, and that is where the ECtheme of the episode comes in.  Cuckolded husbands  and wives  have always been the genres favorite subject matter for some spooky and OOKY supernatural shenanigans, and this case is definitely no exception.  If anything, the rampedup quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere.And that is not to mention that John Espositos original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist.  You are there.Not At least Rob Schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction, especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed!  As with most MOH episodes, this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment, so the extremely squeamish need not apply.",
		"I was all ready to pan this episode, seeing that this Master really does not have any horror films under his belt.. but this is easily the best episode of the season.The acting was good!!  I wrangled it And while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise, at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 mins, something that has been lacking up to this point in the series.I especially liked the bit at the end, not a twist per say, but just a funny little bit where he becomes, as ever, the henpecked hubby.Really good effort.  Like I have said in other reviews these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes.. but they may someday end up being masters in the future.",
		"This was a superb episode, one of the best of both seasons.  Down right horror for a change, with a story that is way way above the average MOH episodes, if there is such a thing.  A mans wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck, in which he was driving.  His airbag worked, hers did not.  She is burned beyond recognition great makeup btw, and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft.  BUT, even in a coma, she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology, and when she does die for a few minutes, her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit.  Carnage of course ensues, and also some extremely gory killings, and also, some extremely sexy scenes.  What more could you ask for, you might ask?  Well, not much, because this baby has it all, and a very satirical ending, that should leave a smile on most viewers faces.  I loved Rob Excellent episode, this is one I am buying for sure.",

		"As we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known.  The two leads always have to get together.  Late in the third act I was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together.  A clue was given right from the start, but you will never realize it until the end.  It is a simple hook, but it works.  It Be You I liked all the NY characters and I loved the locations.  It is a postcard of NY.

If not I will have to rent the movie.  This was a great movie.  I loved Serendipity Great love story for the soul!  I met my one true love my Soulmate and although I had the experience to meet him when I had least expecting it, I was not ready for that kind of emotional relationship.  Altho, we did marry, I was not mature enough to give as much as I thought I would.  I got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for 7 years.  He finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry  in disbelief about the way it turned out.  I had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 years.This movie meant a lot because I am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love.  I can NOW appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of Father Fitzpatrick rang true for me.I know when he has healed enough to trust me again, we will remarry.Do not EVER GET COMPLACENT AND TAKE TRUE LOVE FOR GRANTED!  IT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST LESSON OF MY LIFE.  Also the music in this movie is OUTSTANDING and MEANINGFUL!  This movie is DEEP and spiritually uplifting.  TRUE LOVE is worth waiting for, if it is meant to be, it will, no matter what, IT WILL HAPPEN!  Nothing is impossible, even when it is the second time around!  Thanks!",

		"I would have given this film a few stars, simply because it was a Lifetime presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story  here, New York City.  Most on this channel, whether set there, in rural Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, L.A. etc., are filmed in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or some other Canadian locale.But if there ever were one deserving the top rating  10 on this site, it is this movie.  Certainly not for originality, for this story has been done many times, in many variations, with several very similar to this specific one.  It is also been done pretty often on the big screen, with megastars, past and present, from Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, et al  and Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan, and many more.  I can think of at least 1012 more, just as prominent, past to present, off the top of my head, who could be added now, and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind.Not to drone on, but my point is that, in my opinion, this is by far one of the best of this genre I have seen.  I caught it I would never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made.  And, while the two leads have done enough to be known to most, they were completely unknown to me.  The only two actors I knew were Phyllis Newman Annas mother whom I would seen in some things from her younger days, and Michael Rispoli Henry, Charlies best friend who was outstanding as Gramma, the menacing juice loan, tough, street guy from Rounders.  The chance meeting and coupling between both leads best friends, as a substory romance, with the correlation of their being such to Anna and Charlie being only revealed to all later, is an oftdone plot contrivance within the genre, but makes no difference to the enjoyment here in fact, it enhances it.Checking some other comments, I agree completely with those which are the most positive.  The primary word describing this film is ENGAGING, in caps.  This adjective describes the performers; the characters; the chemistry between and among all of the characters, in whatever combination presented, and all of the supporting and even minor roles.I love films with a harder edge Rounders; the escapist SchwarzeneggerStallone fare; Goodfellows; even the classics like Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane.  But for pure, uncomplicated enjoyment, this one was outstanding.  With a bare fraction of their budgets, it was equal to the results achieved by You have Got Mail and Sleepless in Seattle.  And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan could not have done better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan here; the costars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these megafilms, as well.",
		"It is amazing that from a good, though not wonderful, film made back in the early Nineties, a whole franchise can grow.  Stargate; SG1 is, without a doubt, a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shouldertoshoulder with Star Trek as the kings of scifi.Following on from the 1994 feature film Stargate, this series sees Stargate command a militaryscience organisation figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore.  SG1 betrayed his Earth quickly makes an enemy of the Goauld, a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods.The topnotch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life.  Richard Dean Anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic ONeill, who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye.  Michael Shanks, as Daniel, brings heart and an will of steel to the character, who has grown from wideeyed innocence to darker and more hardbitten as the show has progressed.  Amanda Tapping, as Carter, has perfected the balance between depicting her characters femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong, intelligent military scientist.  Christopher Judge is excellent as the aloof Tealc, who is able to depict the characters emotions with subtlety.  And Don S Davis is perfect as the esteemed General Hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness.Almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence, reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs often shown through arguments between ONeill and Jackson.  Guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that does not bore viewers.  SG1 also excels in humour, from ONeills wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd!  SG1 has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death.  It is not just an excellent scifi show but is an excellent show, overall.",

		"A beautiful postcard of New York.  The thing I enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear.  It never did.  My teenagers liked it too.  My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan.  My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and ALL enjoy something.  This film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done.  The ending came with a twist which we all liked too.  If you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you.  As a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did.  I recommend it",

		"I just cannot understand the negative comments about this film.  Yes it is a typical boymeetsgirl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by.  Henstridge talk about winning the genepool lottery!  is as magnetic and alluring as ever who says the golden age of cinema is dead?  and Vartan holds his own.There is simmering chemistry between the two leads; the film is most alive when they share a scene  lots!  It find yourself If you are already happy, then you will be euphoric.PS I am 33, Male, from the UK and a hopeless romantic still searching for his Princess...",
		"This great movie has failed to register a higher rating than 5! Why not! It rated it In summary I believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright, honestly portrayed and a great witness to the Christian faith!",
		"There are few films or movies I consider favorites over the years.  The Gospel road was one of them.  I watch it My favorite parts were the fact that 1Jesus was blond, 2the last supper was a huge meal,3 he liked playing with the children,4His death was for all people and for all time.The movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting, but it touched my heart at that time.  Besides I am a Johnny Cash fan and it was a brave venture.  If it ever comes out on DVD, I will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons.",
		"I wait for each new episode, each rerun with anticipation!  The new look of scifi created by Stargate SG1 is a wonder that I hope will never end.  To combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me.  Season 9 should be a thrill in itself.  I love his The other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner, season after season.  You cancel this program in the next three years, and you make a serious mistake.  Also, you need a bigger role for the Asgard  they are just too cool.",
		"I thinking it I came out surprised and very amused.  Eva was good, but Lake Bell stole the show.  She had amazing comedic timing.  The jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between.  The plot was enough to tie it all together, a woman Eva dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her wastobe husband, its sounds farfetched but it actually works quite well. 710  Overall its a worthwhile cinema watch, if not get it on DVD when it comes out.",
		"I took a flyer in renting this movie but I gotta say, it was very, very good.  On all fronts script, cast, director, photography, and high production values, etc.  Proves Eva Longoria Parker is head and shoulders in romcom above bad actors such as Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston, who mug and call it acting.  Whoda thunk it? Parker and Isla Fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as Over Her Dead Body.  Lake Bell is excellent, too, and this is the first time I have seen her.  And finally, Paul Rudd gets to shine in a really good movie, instead of lesser films.A movie like this never gets its dues from closeminded males.  It is too bad.  As other IMDb reviewers here have noted, there is nothing lame about this gem no hack writing or acting.  And its depiction of contemporary L.A. and California, in general, makes every scene look bright, beautiful, clean, and otherwise outstanding in every way.  Never before has a movie made L.A. look so good.  Ah suspend disbelief It reminds me very much of the old Topper movies, which were also so enjoyable.This movie exposes popular, but otherwise hackneyed, movies like Ghost for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are.  We already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre.  Some of us save our praise for the truly worthy, however.If you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as Into the Night with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, Blind Date with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, American Dreamer with JoBeth Williams, Chances Are with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard, Making Mr.  Right with John Malkovich, etc., you will enjoy this.  A firstrate job all around even if it is kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years.  But even that plot device does not detract from the movies overall excellence.",

I think it is a shame it only scored 5.2 in rating.  Too many guys voting?  It was far above other romantic comedies.  Just because I am female I do not enjoy all chic flicks, on the contrary I prefer other genres.  Romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be.  But like I said, this movie had it all, almost, in my opinion.  Great script, good oneliners, fine acting.  Although Eva Longoria Parkers character reminded very much of Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives, but so what?  It was awesome.  I will keep this film for rainy days, days when I feel low and need a few laughs.",

The humour is consistently dry and witty.Paul Rudd pretty much plays the mike character from Friends which works great.  The other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic I mean we are not talking Apocalypse Now here But the characters are likable, the story is engaging, the soundtrack, production and direction all work well.In all a great feelgood film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets.Everyone has their own tastes but I really do not understand the one star reviews for this.",
		"I lets them Sadly the actual film was not as good.  OK, there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well.  But from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight I was on.  I think the whole gaybutnotgay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better.  The talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest it was not really very funny.In summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me, but it was a close call.",

It is Gabrielle If you are expecting a Golden Globe nominated movie then you need to rethink how you look at movies.  However, if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie then you have come to the right place.  The characters are all funny.  They work together very well.  The real match up is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell.  He is as funny as he was on Friends and she was funny and good looking all at the same time.  I went with my wife, she enjoyed it and so did I.",

I had promised.However With only one toilet humour gag, Over Her Dead Body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and, without spoiling anything too much, some of the moments involving animals are hilarious.The staple ingredients of a good film are all there; script, director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film stands tall.Sure, you are not going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time!",
		"Once when I was in college and we had an international fair, the Russian section had a Sovietera poster saying Ne boltay! , meaning Do not gossip!.  I translated it in reference to the nosy neighbor on Bewitched.However, when you see the result of gossip in the Pvt.  Snafu short Rumors, you see that it is not quite a laughing matter.  In this case, the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the Axis Powers have attacked the United States.  So, he tells it to someone, who tells someone else, who tells someone else, and it continues.  As in The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming, the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time, so that when it gets back to Snafu...well, you know what I mean!  Yes, it is mostly WWII propaganda  complete with a derogatory term for the Japanese  but I have to say that the Pvt.  Snafu shorts were actually quite funny.  Of course, since they had Dr.  Seuss writing and Mel Blanc providing the voices, it is no surprise that these came out rather cool.  Worth seeing.",

These were called instructional cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funnylooking main character called Pvt.

You can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them.  That includes losing confidence in your country and your cause, as pointed out here in this cartoon.  A good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy.  That is still being done today.  We lost the war, declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon.  Amazing how some Americans still have not learned.  This cartoon may be 65 years old but it sure has relevance today.  As I write this, there were two terrorist bombings in Europe today and some people still think the War On Terror is just a bumper sticker slogan.  Amazing.The writer, the famous Dr.  Suess, uses analogies of hot air balloon juice here to present the above message.  With Theodore Geisel his real name you know the rhymes will be clever.Nothing hilarious here, but it was not meant to be.  You have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was out there during World War II.  People forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning.

		"Tim Krabbe is the praised author of Het Gouden Ei, a novel that was put on the screen twice Spoorloos and The Vanishing.  One of the Dutch writers more recent works is De Grot, a psychological thriller about two totally different men, Egon and Axel, who meet at a youth camp and, surprising enough, become friends for dear life.  Egon spends his Axel, on the other hand, is a charismatic partyanimal, a heavy drinking criminal whose everydays concern is to get a woman into his bedroom.  From the moment they meet, Axel has a strong influence on Egon, while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything such as reading thick books like Egon; ultimately, Egon is even dragged by Egon into illegal practices himself, which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant Asian country.After having read the book last year, I was surprised the critics were quite positive about it.  In my opinion, the book suffers especially from the complex structure.  While Krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people, the plot becomes more of a puzzle the many episodes are not presented chronologically, so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode.  Because of this, the story feels surprisingly remote you often need to know a characters background to really care for him or her.  Another complaint was the fact that the main characters, Egon and Axel, are a little stereotypical.  Egon IS the dull intellectual, while Axel IS his exact opposite.  In real life, such onedimensional people rarely exist; in books and films, they always seem to be there, taking away a lot of credibility.Despite all this, the film was a pleasant surprise, being much better than the book.  The adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography, humour and acting Fedja van Huet Egon is one of the few Dutch actors who can make you forget he IS acting which is, in my opinion, the highest an actor can achieve.  The drawbacks of the film, however, are the same as the books mainly because the characters are onedimensional, they are so predictable that it becomes annoying.  Guess who wrote the script?  Indeed, Krabbe himself.  It is obvious that this talented director that is what the movie makes clear anyway is hampered by a deficient screenplay.  Perhaps Koolhoven should just have chosen a better book.710",

		"De Grot is a terrific Dutch thriller, based on the book written by Tim Krabb?.  Another of his books, Het Gouden Ei was made into the great Dutch mystery thriller called Spoorloos The Vanishing in 1988.  This one is not as good as that thriller although much better than the American remake also called The Vanishing but there are times it comes close.Especially the opening moments are terrific.  We learn his When he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border.  These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted.  A kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this.  Later we see how Egon makes his deal in Thailand with a woman, both stating that they have never done anything like this.From this point the movie is constantly flashback and flashforward.  We see how Egon, still as a child here played by Erik van der Horst, befriends a guy named Axel as a kid played by Benja Bruijning.  We learn how they grew up as friends, sort of, and how Axel as an adult played by Marcel Hensema became a criminal.  Egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman.  Around this time he sometimes meets Axel but does not really want anything to do with him.The movie is chronological in a way.  It shows Egon and Axel as kids, than as students, young adults, and in their midthirties.  But from time to time, like I said, the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again.  Every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults.Minor spoilers herein.The title means The Cave, and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending, although it is in fact not that happy.  Like the beginning, the ending is terrific.  The middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes, only to come back at that point in the end.  It is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending, although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well.",

Shakti is a film about a mothers love and endurance.  It is a film about transformations, ignorance, coming of age, stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life.  The item number in which SRK and Aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie.  It is actually a dream sequence that occurs while SRKs drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze.  He dreams that Aishwarya Rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day, dressed scantily and begins to seduce him.

		"This is probably Karisma at her best, apart from Zubeidaa.  Nana Patekar also gives out his best, without even trying.  The story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag, especially when Shahrukh comes in the picture.  What really made me like it were the performances of the leads, the dialog delivery, as well as the story, for what it was.  It could have been directed better, and edited.  The supporting case was even great, including Karimas mother in law, even though she just had one shining moment, it was great to watch her.The sets were also pretty good.  I give it",
		"A strong woman oriented subject after long, director Krishna Vamsis Shakti The Power, the Desi version of the Hollywood hit Not Without My Daughter is actress Sridevis first homeproduction.  A story about a womans fight against harsh injustice.The story of the film revolves around Nandini Karisma Kapoor who lives in Canada with her two uncles Tiku Talsania, Jaspal Bhatti.  There she meets Shekhar Sanjay Kapoor, falls in love with him and they soon marry.  Their family is complete when Nandini has a boy, Raja Master Jai Gidwani.  But their happiness is short lived, as the news of Shekhars ailing mother Deepti Navalmakes them leave their perfect life in Canada and come to India.  And that is when the problems start.  From the moment they reachIndia, both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere.  They reach Shekhars The filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a neverending drive.  And unfortunately for them, a frenzied mob that beat Shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus.  Fortunately, they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him.  After that, they drive to the handing Havel where Shekhars father, Narsimha Nana Patekar lives with his wife Deepti Naval.  Nandani realized that her fatherinlaw is in command as soon as she enters the place, but her only solace is her motherinlaws warm welcome.Living there, Nandini learns of her fatherinlaws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him.  The day she sees her fatherinlaw teach her son to throw a bomb, she loses it and lashes out against him, insisting to Shekhar that they move back to Canada.  But terror strikes again when Shekhar is murdered one day, leaving a broken down Nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel fatherinlaw.  Her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heartwrenching film.What sets apart Shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie.  The only drawback is Ismail Darbars music, which fails to rise above the script.  The only saving grace is the sexy item number Ishq Kameena, which has been composed by Anu Malik.  Another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast.  Karisma Kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother.  She is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal.  Second is actor Nana Patekar who is back with a bang with this film.  His uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he is shown his versatility once again with this role.  Sanjay Kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors.  Deepti Naval too is in top form and her Prclimax showdown with Nana is praiseworthy.  Shahrukhs cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he is been pulled in to get the required star value.  Though his role was not really required, he is done it well.  Overall, Shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the Prrelease hype is sure to get it a good opening.  Shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up.  So what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least 2 reels to better the impact.  Shakti still has the power to go on without a hitch!",

From the moment they reachIndia, both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere.  They take a crowded train to reach Shekhars village and when they finally reach the station, they have to catch a long bus drive to his village.  The filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a neverending drive.  And unfortunately for them, a frenzied mob that beat Shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus.  Fortunately, they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him.

Her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heartwrenching film.What sets apart Shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie.  The only drawback is Ismail Darbars music, which fails to rise above the script.  The only saving grace is the sexy item number Ishq Kameena, which has been composed by Anu Malik.  Another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast.  Karisma Kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother.  She is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal.  Second is actor Nana Patekar who is back with a bang with this film.  His uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he is shown his versatility once again with this role.  Sanjay Kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors.  Deepti Naval too is in top form and her Prclimax showdown with Nana is praiseworthy.  Shahrukhs cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he is been pulled in to get the required star value.  Though his role was not really required, he is done it well.  Overall, Shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the Prrelease hype is sure to get it a good opening.  Shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up.  So what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least 2 reels to better the impact.  Shakti still has the power to go on without a hitch!",

		"Seeing this movie was the most fun I have had at the cinema in a long time.  However, I am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film, because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied.  This picture has everything any movie could ever have.  It has characteristics It is all in there, adding up to a myth.The basic premise is about an Indian couple, Nandini Karishma Kapoor and Shekhar Sanjay Kapoor, happily living in Canada, who rush to India to visit the husbands parents after a disturbing news report.  The rest of the story takes place in India, where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence.  At one point, the story borrows from Not without my baby, but to call Shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice.The ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions, including Shah Rukh Khans dream of Aishwarya Rai which comes as if out of another movie.  In fact, the two stars are on all the posters, but they appear really late in the film, and only Shah Rukh ends up being a real character.  Yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance.Karishma Kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film, and she does an admirable job, having to link up the films twists and turns with a show of believable emotion.  Another notable presence is Nana Patekar, who plays Narsimha, the tyrannical father of the husband Shekhar.  Nana Patekar dominates every scene he is in with a scary but nuanced character.The movie is not without its share of realism.  Violence is rampant, but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters, with Karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions.  At times, this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic.I have seen a share of Bollywood releases, and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm.  But Shakti raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous.  It is a film that achieves the grandeur of a Shakespearian tragedy, where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained.  It is pure, gratuitous cinema, and the director Krishna Vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book.  Perhaps, the allimportant message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind, but I came out of watching Shakti exhilarated.  Making movies can be the most fun in the world!",
		"Okay, I know this doesnt project India in a good light.  But the overall theme of the movie is not India, it is Shakti.  The power of a warlord, and the power of a mother.  The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth.  Then things go terribly wrong.  The interaction between Nandini and her father in law  the power of their dysfunctional relationship  and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie.  Shah Rukh Khans performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of Karisma Kapoor.  It find yourself The musical interludes are strengths, believable and well done.",
		"The beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mothers love, the exceptional performances, the steady execution and the quite innovative script.  The film tells the story of an Indian woman, Nandini, who lives in Canada with her husband Shekhar and little kid Raja.  All of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in India of whom she had not even known is in troubles and the couple rush to India.  When they get into the village, Nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture; Shekhars family, ruled by his cruel, highly cynical and merciless father Narasimha, lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless.  Nandini return home When she wants to leave, Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India.  Here starts the intense struggle which can be called Nandini vs.  Narasimha.India is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film, but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas, so it may be even correct.  The portrayal is in my view fair and not onesided because the positive side is also presented to an extent.  Such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world.  The locations are amazing, the music is wonderful, and Krishna Vamshis direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing.  One thing that must be noted is the very earpleasing background score by Ismail Darbar, it is beautiful.  The characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film.  Portrayed realistically throughout, the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch.  Its dialogues are superb and intelligently written, and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points, a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension.The films biggest strength is the performances.  Karisma Kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as Nandini.  Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible.  She displays so much intensity, impulsiveness, anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son.  Her outbreaks while facing off Nana Patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child.  After Fiza, this is her most powerful performance.  One of the greatest actors Indian cinema has seen, Nana Patekar is indescribable as Narasimha.  He manages to be hateful as Narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him.  Patekar displays cruelty, wittiness and even humanity with total conviction.  He is outstanding.  Another great performance comes unsurprisingly from Indias most underrated actress, Deepti Naval, who sensitises her character to perfection.  Sanjay Kapoor is just adequate and Shahrukh Khan provides great comic relief.  Anyway, do watch Shakti  it could have been better, but it is definitely a mustwatch.",

		"If any movie stands out extremely with the actors acting skills, this is probably the one.  I seen dialogues The movie was disturbing at moments.  However, the movie was terrible at editing.  The movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs, yet they feel out of place.  Like Karisma is getting beat up, and the same time SRK is fighting comically with the police officers.  The Ishq Kamina song was very out of place.  On top of that, the movie is overly glossy in the beginning.  The direction was not bad, but certainly nothing one can brag about.I have to say that the actors were chosen very wisely.  Without them, this movie would not have an impact.  Karisma Kapoor has given her best role to date, and this looks very good on her record after Zubeidaa and Fiza.  She looks pretty in the first half, and I have never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her.  What is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date.  Nana Patekar was excellent as her fatherinlaw.  Not much to say about him, besides this is a role made for him.  Deepti Naval as the motherinlaw was excellent especially in her final scene.  Though she does not have much to say, her facial expressions and body language was good.  The other good performance was the little kid.  He was adorable, and is sure to bring tears to the viewers eyes.  The movie was probably saved desperately by their performances.  Sanjay Kapoor was all right, but he did not have much to do.  Shahrukh Khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role.  One thing that brought the audience to the theater was Ishq Kamina.  The song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song.  And boy Aish is mad hot.  However, the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever.  People may have come to the movie for Aish, but they will not brag too much about it afterwards.  Hum Tum Miley was properly paced, but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie.  Damroo Bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about.  Dil Ne Pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie.  Despite the poor editing, the performances alone make it a must see.",

		"This is the Who at their most powerful.  Although before the masterwork Who is Next, which would provide anthems like Baba Oreily and Wont Get Fooled Again.  This film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the 70s.Daltrey shows what being a frontman is all about, Entwistle steady as ever.  Moon drum head Townsend even looks like he is enjoying himself occasionally! Considering they took to the stage at 2am no one in the crowd was asleep!  There are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in 36 years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one.",

		"This review is dedicated to the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle.The Original Drum and Bass.There seems to be very little early Who footage around these days, if there is more then lets be aving it, nowadays it tends to be of a very different kind of Who altogether, a parody, a shadow of their much better years.  To be fair, not one of them has to prove anything to anyone anymore, they have earned their respect and with overtime.This concert footage for me is one of their best.  To command an audience of around a 400,000 plus strong crowed takes skill, charisma, wit and a whole lot of bloody good music.We all know of the other acts on the bill, The Doors their last ever show weeks before Jim Morrison died, Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many more.  The point being that whoever were there it was The Who that the majority had come to see.  This show was one year after the Great Hippie Fest of the 1960s; Woodstock.  The film and record had come out and so had The Who is greatest work to date, Tommy.  The ever hungry crowd wanted a taste, to be able to experience their own unique event, to be able to Grove and Love in the knowledge that this gig was their own.  To do this you needed the best of what Rock n Roll had to throw at the hungrily baited crowd.At two o clock in the morning in late August 1970 the M.C. announces, Ladies and Gentlemen, a small Rock n Roll band from Shepherds Bush London, the OO.John Entwistles body suit is of black leather, on the front is the out line of a human skeleton from neck to toe, Roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit of long tassels and long flowing hair, Keith in a white tshirt and jeans, as Pete had his white boiler suit and Doc Martins that he would preferred to wear.The Who never stopped their onslaught of High Energy Rock for over two hours, performing theirs and other artists greatest tracks such as Young Man Blues, Shaking all Over, and then as on queue, Keith baiting the crowed to Shut up, it is a bleeding Opera with Tommy, the Rock Opera.  The crowed went wild.  This is what they had come to hear, and the Who did not disappoint, straight into Overture and never coming up for air until the final note of Tommy can you Hear me?  Amazing.To capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a Festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the World was a fantastic piece of Cinematic History.The English DVD only comes in a soundtrack of EnglishLinear PCM Stereo, were as in the States, I think, you can get it with 5.1 at least, Check local press for details on that, okay.The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes with no extras, which is a disappointment.  Yes, for a slice of Rock and Festival History this DVD would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play, for some of the best Who concert footage as it was meant to be, Live, Raw and in your Face! I been nice.Thanks",
		"This would have worked a lot better if it had been made as Mitchell in Malta.  At least then we would have been spared the sight of Joe Don Baker running around an otherwise scenic Mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit...not to mention acting like an Old West gunslinger.

At least then we would have been spared the sight of Joe Don Baker running around an otherwise scenic Mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit...not to mention acting like an Old West gunslinger.  Mitchell being Mitchell, the film would not have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either.  Oh well.

		"Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material, and almost always under appreciated.  He is been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero, and has the type of strong, solid presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him.  Baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor, and that is what is so great about him.  He puts him It is what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy work so well, and that same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE.  This was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era.  By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there is a real timeless quality that does not jar you away from the action on screen.  To be honest, I have always enjoyed the films of Greydon Clark, who is a nononsense director in the same vein as 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his best.  FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost gems of the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true grit and violence.  I suppose if they remake this with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to love it as much as I do.",

		"Well it is been a long year and I am down to reviewing the final film for 2004.  Panaghoy Sa Suba Call of The River placed second in the recent Metro Manila Film Festival.  As expected, it did not do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since MMFF is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies.It was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in Filipino or English play out in the screen.  I thought Cesar His great vision and creativity really helped this film.  He was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film.  Also performing well was young actress Rebecca Lusterio.  She did a great job portraying Bikay, the younger sister of Duroy.  I hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres.  I think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her.Some of the camera shots in the film were done very well.  The scenery was made breathtaking even though I feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different.In terms of the story I feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film.  I certainly will not be raving about the story of this film.",

		"As a kid, I loved this game.  I played it I used to play Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored.  Then Streets of Rage 2 came out.  And we quickly forgot that this one even existed.You play as excops Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way.  There are 8 levels to work thru in a rundown and corrupt city led by the evil Mr X.  Beating up all the bad guys and the endoflevel boss is much fun.  Level 4 The Bridge was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river.  You even have the chance to become Mr.  Xs right hand man at the end of the game at a price.  This leads to the bad ending in which you become the the boss of the syndicate.  Exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to Mr.  X, but never mind.Streets of Rage also has truly fantastic music.  The composer Yuzo Koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the Sega Genesis.  The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are standout tunes.  As a Wii owner I am proud to have this forever on my console.  But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete.ProsAverage graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comicbook like panel progression that fits the tone of the game.Great tunes.Easy to get into and hard to put down.ConsVastly inferior to the infinitely more complex Streets of Rage 2.Poor enemy AI.  Baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat.  This is especially infuriating with the Level 5 boss.Lack of combo moves.Lack of decent weapons.Bad guy models are repeated far too often.Graphics B Sound A Gameplay B Lasting Appeal B",

		"On Sunday July 27, 1997, the first episode of a new science fiction series called Stargate SG1 was broadcast on Showtime.  A spinoff of and sequel to the 1994 film Stargate starring Kurt Russell and James Spader, the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film.  For ten seasons, it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as SG1.  Originally, the series starred Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack ONeill two ls! , Michael Shanks as Dr.  Daniel Jackson, Amanda Tapping as Captain Samantha Carter, Christopher Judge as Tealc and Don S.  Davis as Major General George S.  Hammond.  For ten long years, we watched the team battle against the Goauld, the Replicators, the Ori and many other aggressors.  At the same time, they forged alliances with the Asgard, the Tokra, the rebel Jaffa, the Nox and the Tollan.  They claimed them And sometimes not even then.As with all longrunning series, they were numerous cast changes.  Michael Shanks left the series in January 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor.  Daniel Jacksons successor as the teams resident archaeologistgeek was Jonas Quinn, an alien from a country called Kelowna on the planet Langara, played by Corin Nemec.  However, Shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in June 2003 and Nemec left at the same time.  Unfortunately, he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards.  Don S.  Davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in March 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go.  The show is original star and arguably its most popular actor, Richard Dean Anderson, starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons.  His participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons.  He finally left SG1 in March 2005 in order to spend more time with his then sixyearold daughter.  Jack ONeill was by far my favourite character in the series and, truth be told, I never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as I did the earlier episodes for that very reason.The ninth season represented a new era for the programme.  With the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the Goauld and the Replicators in Season Eight, many fans felt the series should go out on a high.  Regardless, the series carried on for a further two years with the Ori replacing the Goauld as the series main adversaries.  Three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this reinvention.  Ben Browder came in as the cocky Southern Air Force pilot Lt.  Colonel Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG1.  His Farscape costar, the lovely Claudia Black, began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious, sexy, hilarious and certainly extroverted Vala Mal Doran, a former Goauld host and con artist from another planet.  A recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons, she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season.  Rounding off the cast was the legendary Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry, the new commander of the SGC and an old friend of Jack ONeill and General Hammond.  For the last two years, they starred alongside the SG1 faithful Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the Stargate franchise.Alas, all good things must come to an end.  During the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of Season Ten, ratings dropped considerably, resulting in cancellation in its August 2006.  After ten seasons and 214 episodes, the dream was finally over.  On March 13, 2007, what began with Children of the Gods ended with Unending.  The series finale made its world premiere on Sky One in Britain and Ireland before being shown on the SciFi Channel in the United States on June 22, 2007.In the ten years that the series was on the air, it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series, Star Trek, in terms of popularity in certain countries.  It became the secondlongest running scifi series in the world, second only to Doctor Who 19631989, and the longestrunning American produced scifi series, having surpassed The XFiles only a few months before it ended.Stargate SG1 represents the cornerstone of the Stargate franchise.  In 2004, its success and popularity led to the production of a spinoff series entitled Stargate Atlantis, which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in August 2008.  Although plans for another feature film fell through, two directtoDVD films, Stargate The Ark of Truth and Stargate Continuum, were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future.  A third liveaction series, Stargate Universe, is also due to premiere at some point next year.  There was, unfortunately, an animated series, Stargate Infinity, which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better.  Despite the end of SG1 and Atlantis as continuing series, the future of Stargate looks very bright indeed.In conclusion, while Stargate has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major scifi television franchises such as Star Trek and Doctor Who, its still relatively new compared to those two scifi giants and I have every confidence that it will continue for many, many years to come.",

		"Although not the best Anime I have ever seen but I enjoyed Lady Death.I have never read the comic book and just saw this at the video store and decided to give it a chance.The animation was OK, I got the sense of the 80s anime from it which is what set it off for me.  Why everyone else hates that is beyond me.Character development was fine.  I like how they brought the transition from Hope to Lady Death around. for you who do not like it, obviously was not paying attention.  Lucifer tells you",

		"Stargate SG1 follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named SG1 through a device called the Stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole.Having seen this series sporadically for it is first few seasons when it first came out, I did not know how good this series would really be, 10 years after I had last seen an episode.  My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth.  Stargate SG1 is more than just a simple scifi series, it is one of the most well made, interesting, long running, exciting scifi ever produced.  And why?  Because it runs on an amazing premise.This series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and I think it is a very good example that television, as a medium, with a suitable premise, is able to provide something that does not work on the time restriction of film.  The sense of familiarity created by a long running series, watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief, and it is all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show.Stargate SG1 kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years, but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show  The first few seasons, perhaps up to the 4th5th, focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending Goauld threat.   From the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the Goauld and preventing attacks on Earth.  After this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg1 in a place of Goauldreplicatorori conflicts The 8th season is probably the most mixed one.  It has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned, but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments.   The 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no Jack ONeil.  They puts it A last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome, but ultimately things are as they are.In the end, because of the fact that I enjoyed everything, it is a little hard to find that it ends.  The big picture, however, the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years, is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew, those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of SG1.",
		"Narratives keep track This is especially true in film, I think, simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema.  Viewers like myself, however, do not have that problem because we see all our films on DVD or VHS.A year ago I was introduced to Audrey Tautou, a French actress, whom I first saw in The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain 2001 and later in A Very Long Engagement 2004, both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters.  This earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways more characters and more complexity.Now, other directors have used those techniques before Robert Altman with The Player 1992, Short Cuts 1993, Gosford Park 2001 and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia 1999.  Stanley Kramer did it with A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, a comedy of almost epic proportions.  The difference with this film is, first the director lets us see inside the head of some of the characters and second, some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewers memory as the story flipflops between different time periods.The basic  the core, so to speak  story concerns a young woman, Irene Tautou who is told, by a fellow commuter on a train, that she will meet her true love on that day.  This occurs in the first few minutes of the film.  The clever irony at this point is that Irene does not realize that the young man opposite Gilbert Robin may be that one true love.  And, nor does he...They go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter.  However, chaos results throughout the rest of the day, not only for the two young people, but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere, and yet...If the story were simply that, it could tend to be boring, and even quite predictable.  Not so.  The script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too commonplace, but which are turned into believable, extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again.  For example, the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours, consider your alternatives; two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before Irene and her man of destiny meet again.  Or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen?  Consider again what would happen...All of that is interesting enough.  What was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was THE ONE for Irene, or whether it was, in fact, the young man on the train.  That kept me guessing for a while.I will let you think about that, should you see this delightful romp.Recommended for all.",
		"This entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment  its the best ending of any movie I have ever seen.  Perfect, beautiful, funny, simply wonderful.I found this movie delightful, even with it is French takingitselftooseriously deep meanings thing going on.

Laurent Firode, the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of France in recent memory.The film deals with chance, as its English title indicates.  The French title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the Atlantic as they fly, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects.  From the start, the director interlaces all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other, something that is hard to imagine, but in the films context seems to work well.A chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film.  Irene tell her Irene, it seems will cross paths and will find her soul mate that same day.  After Irene leaves the train, the quiet young man seated next to the woman tells her he has the same birth date as Irene.  It seems they are destined to one another from the start, but alas, they will not reconnect until the last frame of the film.Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene.  Faudel, who plays Younes, does not have a lot to do until the end, but he shows he has a presence and plays well his part.  The talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as butterfly wings.We look forward to future films by Laurent Firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected.",

		"To me, this review may contain spoilers, but I like watching movies with NO idea of what is going to happen, so therefore I think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers! I just watched this movie again, and I must reiterate that it has the BEST ending to any movie.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  The real translation, The Beating of the Butterflys Wings, is oddly not used as the translated title.  I suppose they The movie is based on chaos theory, and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events, which all lead back to one event.  The movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect, as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters about 20?.  In a way, the ending seems inevitable despite this, but if you think about it, it is a perfect ending.  Think to yourself, what else needed to be said?  It is at the same time a very brave ending.  Too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one, but an ending like this would NEVER come out of Hollywood.",
		"Most people who chase after movies featuring Audrey Tautou seem to not understand that Amelie was a character  it is not really Audrey Tautous real life personality, hence, every movie she partakes in is not going to be Amelie part 2, part 3, etc.Now with that said, I too picked up this movie simply because Audrey was in it.  Yes, it is true, there is a big gap after the first scene where she is not seen at all for maybe 45 min, but I did not even miss her because I was having so much fun with the other characters.  The guy who lies about everything is too funny, the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss, actually.... getting into all the characters here could take quite a while, but this is one of the best movies I have seen in a while.Audrey Tautous character Irene is not the overdone sugary girl that Amelie was.  In fact, as Irene, her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first.  In this film, Irene is a girl with good intentions, but over the course of a very awful day, her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic.What makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building... very entertaining to watch, great scenery and shots, very colorful and never too slow, and all of the characters can actually act.  The best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left.... this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense, and the whole butterfly effect blossoms.  I swear, it was the best 20 minutes of film I have seen in quite a while, and the ending....  It made me The ending to this movie is top notch.  Whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant, because not only are there all these other subplots going on, but to somehow make them all tie in together and in a sensible manner, which is the case here but also to make each character feel human and come alive, not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect... very impressive.I highly suggest this movie as it is a great film to watch anytime, in any mood, with any company or alone.",

		"When a rich tycoon is killed in a plane crash, his spinster twin sister, Martha Craig Madge Kennedy, does not believe he grabbed the controls in a suicide dive even though selfsnuff runs in the family but his three beautiful daughters could not care less.  The pilot, Jim Norton John Bromfield, goes to work for Valerie Craig Kathleen Hughes who soon coerces him into helping her wrest control of the estate from her troubled sister, Lorna Sara Shane and the family lawyer Jess Barker.  Valerie wants Norton All bets are off as a world of woe including corporate chicanery, seductions, suicides, blackmail, a murder plot, the Mann Act, doublecrosses, disfigurement, and poetic justice befall Craig Manor, an imposing mansion on a bluff overlooking the sea...This preposterous potboiler would have made a perfect second feature for WRITTEN ON THE WIND, also from 1956.  Douglas Sirks saga of a powerful and powerfully dysfunctional oil clan was said to have inspired the 1980s nighttime TV serial DALLAS but the Craigs lowbrow excursion into insanity seems right out of it is sinful sistersoap, DYNASTY.  All three siblings only one of whom is really bad are great beauties but it is Kathleen Hughes cartoon villainy that stands out.  Valerie is relentless in her quest to inherit the family fortune and her unbridled enthusiasm for evil is one of the movies many guilty pleasures.  Teenage sister Vicki is quite a piece of work as well, reminiscent of Carmen Sternwood in THE BIG SLEEP.  When they first meet, she pulls the equivalent of trying to sit on Nortons lap while he is still standing by coming on to him with the line I graduated summa cum laude from Embraceable U.  Whew!

It is one interesting twist on the themes from It is A Wonderful Life.Zero is married to Ida Kaminsky and the two of them belong to a special class of elderly Jewish poor in New York.  Mostel prevented him Kaminsky is mostly bedridden.  He is reduced to applying for welfare.  In desperation like Jimmy Stewart, he cries out to God for some help.Now maybe if he had gotten someone like Henry Travers things might have worked out differently, but even Stewart had trouble accepting Travers.  But Travers had one thing going for him, he was over 100 years off this mortal coil and all his ties to earthly things were gone.  God sent Mostel something quite different, the recently deceased Harry Belafonte who should have at least been given some basic training for angels before being given an assignment.Belafonte has not accepted he is moved on from life, he is still got a lot of issues.  He also has a wife, Gloria Foster, who does not know he is passed on, hit by a car right at the beginning of the film.  You put his issues and Mostels issues and you have got a good conflict, starting with the fact that Mostel cannot believe in a black Jew named Levine.This was the farewell performance for PolishJewish actress Ida Kaminsky who got a nomination for Best Actress in The Shop on Main Street a few years back.  The other prominent role here is that of Irish actor Milo OShea playing a nice Jewish doctor.  Remembering OSheas brogue from The Verdict, I was really surprised to see and hear him carry off the part of the doctor.The Angel Levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society.  It is brought to you by a stellar cast and of course created by acclaimed writer Bernard Malamud.  Make sure to catch it when broadcast.",

Belafonte earn his He learns too late how empty his hustling, materialistic life was without love.  Mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife Fanny.  In spite of his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting or believing in one.  The two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other, the result being hilarious and touchingly sad.The perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film.  After looking everywhere for Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see a falling feather, and he frantically reaches for it as if he is finally willing to believe in angels and miracles.  But Belafonte was not allowed to finish his miracle either to restore Fannys health or Mostels faith, so he never got his wings.  The feather floats tauntingly out of Mostels grasp, a metaphor for both mens live it is too late and you do not get a second chance.

		"... and I DO mean it.  If not literally after all, I have not seen every movie ever created! , at least, obviously, among the ones, the many I know.5.3 ???  The rule of thumb with IMDb is this sometimes movies rated very highly for example, the piece of KannesKompetitionKrownedKoreanKraap called Oldboy can be truly bad.  But rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6.  This movie, very much worth watching, is.  A disgrace.True, I give it a 10 in protest.  The movie is not perfect.  Its true rating should be an 8 or a 9.  It has some acting flaws Belafonte especially, the script wanders around, sometimes.  However, what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times, the Czech Jan Kadar, directing two of the greatest actors of all time, the beloved, largerthanlife Zero Mostel and the sublime Ida Kaminska in an actingpoeticmoral tour de force.  A pair made in Heaven!  It gave us",
		"I see it.The Elvira delivered the movie with as many laughs as one can.It is an ok monster flick, compared to the hundreds of horrendous American flicks made.  Way better!!!!",
		"I was around 7 when I saw this movie first.  It are Yetis Yeti for ever!!!",
		"Most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm.  Not so this gloriously bent, batty and berserk overthetop Italianmade shotinCanada kitsch gutbuster It is a wildly ripe and vigorously moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning apotheosis of righteously overbaked what the hells going on?  crackpot excess and inanity.A freighter ship crew discovers the body of a 30foot yeti that resembles a hirsute 70s disco stud complete with jumbo wavy afro perfectly preserved in a large chunk of ice.  They mistreat him Before you can say Hey, the filmmakers are obviously ripping off King Kong, our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage, grabs the first luscious nubile blonde Euro vixen the gorgeous Pheonix Grant he lays lustful eyes on, and storms away with his new lady love.  The yeti gets recaptured and flown to Toronto to be showed off to a gawking audience.  Of course, he breaks free again, nabs the vixen, and goes on the expected stomping around the city rampage.The sublimely stupid dialogue sample line Philosophy has no place in science, professor, cheesy far from special effects the horrendous transparent blue screen work and cruddy Tonka toy miniatures are especially uproarious in their very jawdropping awfulness, clunky misdirection, and a heavyhanded script that even attempts a clumsily sincere Is the yeti a man or a beast?  ethical debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar its absurd way across the big screen.  Better still, we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yetis nipples, which causes it to harden and elicits a big, leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth ! ; the vixen nurses the yetis wounded hand while he makes googoo eyes at her, the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building, and the furry fellow even breaks a mans neck with his toes !!.  Overall, this singularly screwball and shamefully unheralded shouldbe camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectiously asinine celluloid lunacy that is eminently worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following.",
		"Being a giant monster fan, me seeing Yeti was an absolute must, especially after hearing so much about it.  Thanks dare I It kicks in pretty quickly as Yeti is found pretty much immediately, and we get introduced to various characters.  They consist of some sleazy ones, some good ones, and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy scifi film, by far.Yeti looks like a longhaired guy straight out of the original Woodstock concert, and really, he is not that bad of a dude, especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cagelike thing.  Godzilla he is not  despite his rude awakening, he does not even rampage actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture, but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out.  Yeti seems to understand English pretty nicely my copy was dubbed in English and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are.However, we want to see the giant Yeti do his thing, and he is pretty much in the whole movie, and in typical lowbudget fashion, he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there is even a bunch of the fake legs shots of him just standing there.Yes, the special effects are not the greatest, but there are definitely some good ones here.  A scene where Yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well, and in another, he uses the windows of a building as ladder steps to climb down from the top of it  shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside  in one sequence that really looks much, much better than it should in such a bad movie.Yeti never stoops as low as say, A.P.E. does.  Actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes Yetis nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an oh yeah baby manner.  But even this is not that bad, and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer.The movie is pretty long for this kind of thing, but surprisingly enough it does not get boring  the story is actually good, and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy.Yeti may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks, but it is definitely better than other King Kong 76 ripoffs like A.P.E. and Queen Kong by very far.",

		"YETI deserves the 8 star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made.  I saw it The millionaire who funds the project to thaw the Yeti looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman both poured into an illfitting suit  the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen  and yes, there is a mute boy who sorta kinda looks like a girl and he is mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents hmmm maybe therapy for the kid??.  Then this hottie Italian girl is seen by Yeti once he thaws  which takes FOREVER  and he is instantly in love with her  what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant Yeti makes bedroom eyes at her  it is like a large Barry White trying to seduce a groupie.  In fact, once the large Yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest  she accidentally touches the Yetis nipple and yes, the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple GET HARD!!!!  Yikes of all YIKES!  Plus there is a collie dog in it because the Italian producer must have heard that American audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a Lassie  there is also this insane scene where the Yeti eats a giant fish  keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the Italian girls hair Gee, thanks Yeti  now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout.  You are the best.  This film is more bizarre than something Ed Wood could have ever dreamt up.  If you are a fan of classic cinema crap  seek this baby out.",

		"Heres another movie that should be loaded into a satellite, fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy Andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity.  This movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a ripoff of the already bad movie classic KING KONG from 1976 that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness, but successfully predicted much of Peter Jacksons miserable 2005 computer cartoon bearing the same name, as far as a romance between the giant here a Yeti and a gorgeous human female Antonellina Interlenghi of Umberto Lenzis CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, who is very easy on the eyes.The film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex  the Yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package, the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness.  But as a tradeoff you DO get a wacky old scientist, two inquisitive kids, Tony Kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain, a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure Dog Adventure movies were big in Europe for a while and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the Yeti, who turns out to be the good guy, glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands, a monster who is size literally changes scale from shot to shot, some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in GODZILLA VS THE SMOG MONSTER look tame by comparison, crowd reaction shots aplenty made up of either Spanish, Italian or Canadian extras depending upon scene you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed, and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie.It is here that the film won me over It is enthusiasm just for being made.  Frank Kramer is actually the same Gianfranco Parolini who brought the world SARTANA in 1968 and GODS GUN the year before this  was a very important director in the Spaghetti Western and actionadventure genre film scene from the 1960s1970s and by the time of YETI he was probably delighted to get the work.  I is his The movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless.  Or rather they are part of the fun, and if the movie had been played seriously it would not have worked  WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY PETER JACKSONS MOVIE SUCKED.  He forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid Power Macintosh pod people animators, and with all it is faults  clunkiness, Kramers YETI is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this, which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages, not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space.  I would rank this up there with KING KONG VERSUS GODZILLA and IT!  CURSE OF THE GREAT GOLEM as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever.  Because the movie looks so fake you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked, trampled, tossed about and smashed.  Knowing that and armed with a fertile, energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie, Parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie I will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend.  This is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid.1010, it is about ten minutes too long but who cares, you only come around once and I would rather go out with a smile on my face.",

		"People expect no less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs a movie, and this movie is no exception.  Some movies I love did poorly at the box office but, I am glad to say, this movie is not one of them over nine million dollars, which I do not think was bad for back then.  The characters were fun, the animation was clear and not fuzzy, and the music was modern, too, which is unusual for an animated movie.  I think Professor Overall, this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that I have loved dearly for years.",
		"I disagree with Anyone who donet like this movie.  I used to LOVE this movie when I was little and I still do.  It warms your And It proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed.  And even though it did not have much of a story, it was still excellent I give it a 10 and two thumbs up.  Oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wishs and dreams can come true.  Tear, tearI love this movie, personally if anyone says it sucked than I will say Shame on you.  Because it was a delightful little movie and I am glad that at least SOME people liked it.",

		"I do try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, but I was flabbergasted when I saw the 5.4 rating to one of my childhood favourites.  It wow me Kids will definitely love it and will not mind the flaws, and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film.  None of the film was preachy in any way, in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness.  I will admit though that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like Screweyess deathwhich still freaks me out may be a tad on the scary side.  But the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation.  The music by James Horner is very beautiful, and the song featured is memorable, catchy and amusing.  I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the most indepth of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least engaging.  Martin Shorts clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the part when he tells Screweyes I quit!  had me in stitches.  My favourite is Screweyes though, an effective villain who is crafty and I suppose intelligent.  If anything though, I wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could have been more developed in terms of depth.  The script, while not Oscarworthy, has its funny and heartwarming parts, and should keep kids and adults entertained.  The voice acting for me was what made the movie.  John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith all gave solid performances, but special mention has to go to Kenneth Mars for he was absolutely superb as Screweyes and almost unrecognisable.  All in all, this is a good movie.  I do not get the rating, honestly I do not.  Sure this film is not perfect, and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as Land Before Time, but it is good fun. 7.510 Bethany Cox",

		"I got it What stood out for me was the lack of midmovie conflict that so many movies have, where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just do not say the one thing that you are shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal, that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say.  This is what I like the most about the movie I guess, that the main characters do not do mean things to each other halfway through... they do not break up and make up, they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on.These two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track, they are not that different.  Loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family, and Cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone.  Anyway, I saw this movie posted on Hulu and had to watch it again... sure there is plot holes if you analyze the script and no, Woog and Dweeb should not be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality.Now, what detracts from the film is it is unexpected scariness.  Little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with Dr.  Screweyes.  And, the addition of him halfway through the movie though it is blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance is too abrupt... there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie, perhaps to show that it is not that scary without the the dinosaurs.  I guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie, so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half.Considering the target audience, who I am sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues...  I think I will give it a pass on those factors too, and just enjoy the story.

		"This movie has to be my favorite of all time.  Its believe it This was an exercise in visual effects, and does not cut away when the action happens like every other film does.  Movies these days are now all about sound effects, leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with CGI blood.  There still are movie makers who still cannot get fake blood to look like the real thing.  There is no rape scene because that was not the point of making the film.  Have you seen the hills have eyes 2?  The rape scene was funny instead of shocking.  Although i am sure there are some GONZO porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror.  But since they probably suck at making films, they probably would not be able to pull it off.  The movie Baise Moi has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks.Its too bad that a movie cannot be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all, especially when talking about an AO or NC17 rating.  I am sure Eli Roth has the abilitytalent to make his Hostel film series much much better, but he has too tame it down to get an R rating...or at least I hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations.Watch Traces of Death or More than Smashed Pumpkins if you want no frills real footage accident  crime scenesfootage.  Do not forget that this movie was made in 1985.  The fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film.

		"I first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick Snuff.  I was told that Devils Experiment was much better so naturally I went ahead and ordered the Guinea Pig box set.  I was peaked.Devils Just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes.  They torture her in various ways like beating her, spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to hipitched noise for 24 hours, smash her hand with a mallet, burning and putting maggots on the burns, throwing guts at her, and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye.I must say that a lot of this movie was fake, like the beating scenes.  But then, some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out.  The scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it.  Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about.  The worst is the eye scene.  I did not shutter when watching it but simply thought Damn, that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie.  I did enjoy the flick but I do not know if I can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 710",

They brought Daniel With the new writers and the close attention by Produer Peter Deleuise, the show became more and more solid.The characters had become stale as well.  Colonel Jack ONeill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage.  After his son Charlie was killed in a shooting accident with ONeills weapon, he had decided to end his own life by going to Abydos in order to face off with the Goould RA.  The character offers little growth for any actor and actor Richard Dean Anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself. only allowing his close friends in.Amanda Tapping joined the cast as Captain Samantha Carter.  She was a feminist on the edge, ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job.  Though this character had little area to grow, Tapping has done a great job of concentrating on Carters strengths.  She has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things Carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently.  Christopher Judge joined the cast playing the alien Tealc.  Tealc was an alien called the Jaffa.  Infant Goould, snake like creatures would embed themselves into the Jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form.  The Jaffa would die.  Tealc was the First Prime of Apophis army.  Knowing that Apophis was not a god like Goould pretend, he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy.  Finally, having had enough, he and Jack ONeill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people.  After arriving on Earth, he realized that Earth was the planet he was looking for, who would help him fight the Goould.  Christopher Judge has done quite a bit with a limited character.  Tealc is a wise warrior, much of which he learned was from his teacher Master Bratac.  The show would not be complete without Master Bratac played by Tony Amandola.  He is also a rock.  In the end, he became adviser to most of SG1, especially Daniel Jackson.  Don S.  Davil was there from the beginning playing Major General George Hammand.  Davis has done an incredible job with Hammond making him sympathetic and normal.  He does his job, has a wife, sons and daughters and grandchildren.  You can really say, he is the anchor of the base.  Simply, I would die for that man.  If not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world.  He will go himself.  He does not leave anyone behind.I saved Dr.  Daniel Jackson for last, because this character, I believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on.  In choosing Shanks I do not think the producer realized how strong Shanks would be and now when people talk about Jackson, they do not talk about Spader, they talk about Shanks.  In the early years, the Jackson character came off as a whiner.  That is why I probably was not a fan.  As the seasons pasted, the character became stronger.  This gave him confidence.  In the end, as of season 10, the Jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero.  He still monitors the groups ethics.  He still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward.  Acheaology, History, Culture and Exploration are part of his very being.  He is determined.  Though a man of peace, he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement.  Other characters include, most recently Vala Mal DoranClaudia Black and Colonel Cameron MitchellBen Browder, new lead of SG1.

After arriving on Earth, he realized that Earth was the planet he was looking for, who would help him fight the Goould.  Christopher Judge has done quite a bit with a limited character.  Tealc is a wise warrior, much of which he learned was from his teacher Master Bratac.  The show would not be complete without Master Bratac played by Tony Amandola.  He is also a rock.  In the end, he became adviser to most of SG1, especially Daniel Jackson.  Don S.  Davil was there from the beginning playing Major General George Hammand.  Davis has done an incredible job with Hammond making him sympathetic and normal.  He does his job, has a wife, sons and daughters and grandchildren.  You can really say, he is the anchor of the base.  Simply, I would die for that man.  If not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world.  He go himself He does not leave anyone behind.I saved Dr.  Daniel Jackson for last, because this character, I believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on.  In choosing Shanks I do not think the producer realized how strong Shanks would be and now when people talk about Jackson, they do not talk about Spader, they talk about Shanks.  In the early years, the Jackson character came off as a whiner.  That is why I probably was not a fan.  As the seasons pasted, the character became stronger.  This gave him confidence.  In the end, as of season 10, the Jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero.  He still monitors the groups ethics.  He still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward.  Acheaology, History, Culture and Exploration are part of his very being.  He is determined.  Though a man of peace, he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement.  Other characters include, most recently Vala Mal DoranClaudia Black and Colonel Cameron MitchellBen Browder, new lead of SG1.  Both actors come from a series called Farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess.  I see little difference between Mitchell and Crichton Farscape character.  Blacks character is simply off the wall.  Definitely different from her soldier like character Arin Soon.",

		"Guinea Pig The Devils Experiment is without a doubt  stars on first view, its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature.  This movie gets right to the point, you may be thinking what point?  The point is to satisfy fans of just extreme violence and gore.  This movie has some gore, more or less just torturing a women violently.  There are really only 3 scenes that could be considered gore.  I tell you If you thought Hostile was a crazy brutal disturbing torture flick then you as not seen the half of it until you have seen Guinea Pig The Devils Experiment.Movie Rating 05, Gore 010Guinea Pig The Devils Experiment Uncut  7",
		"I am surprised than many viewers hold more respect for the sequel to this brilliant movie...  I have doubts",
		"After having watched Guinea Pig, two questions come in mind  besides Am I really a psychopath to watch that ?    Is it a snuff ?  The answer is no ; although it is the closest thing to a snuff movie I have ever seen.  And then  Where the hell have they found that girl ?.  Because she gets tortured for 45 min, without any reasons given  in fact, there is nothing else in this movie !   Fingernails teared off, beaten with hands, feet, tools, infested by maggots, ... and many more until the final scene  I am still not sure how they did that .  Because it belongs to the japonese underground scene, it is obvious she did not get a lot of money.  So what were her  their  motivations ? I saw it I have not seen yet all the serial, but the first Guinea Pig is not known for being the best one.  Still I have rated 8, because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff, the issue is quite good  ask Charlie Sheen, the actor .  But I think they could have gone further, which they did in the following ones.Another movie I am hiding from my parents.810",
		"This movie has no story.  It is only about a bunch of guys who tortures an innocent young girl to death.!!! SPOILERS!!! This is what they do They beat her, put her in a net and let her hang inside like birdfood, spin her around on a chair until she pukes, expose her to loud noise, pour boiling oil on her, put worms in her sores, crush her hand with a sledgehammer and finally pokes a needle through her eye.This movie was so realistic that if I did not know it was fake I would have thought it was a snuffmovie.  Although I was disgusted by this movie i really liked it.  It scared me I guess it fills some kind of purpose.  I give it a 1010.",

		"The first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape, complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame.  It torture her The hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers, her hand smashed with a hammer, her eye punctured with a needle, and so forth.In the most nauseating scene, the womans captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns.  The series received a great deal of publicity when American actor Charlie Sheen, believing the series to contain actual murder, attempted to ban its distribution in the United States.  An FBI investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers  sick recreations using nasty, but obvious special effects.  Gruesomely staged by acclaimed Japanese comicbook artist Hideshi Hino, who also directed the third and fourth episodes, this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms.  But, gorehounds probably will not find anything special.",
		"Wow, alot of reviews for the Devils Experiment are here.  Wonderful.  My name is Steve and I run Unearthed Films.  We just started releasing the Guinea Pig films on DVD for North America.  Now before you ask why am I writing a review?  Instead ask why some people bash it.  I am writing this review because I love the Guinea Pig films.  Why do I love em, it is because they go for the throat and they do not let go.  I seen it Almost every horror film known to man, Argento, Fulci, Bava, Buttgereit. from every underground cult sensation to every Hollywood blockbuster.  I have seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the Guinea Pig films.  Why because it does not try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place.  This review is for the Devils Experiment.  I find it devoid of story which is fine by me.  Why do I watch horror films?  So I can see blood and gore and the torture of people.  The Devils Experiment not only delivers but that is all it is.  Pure unadulterated violence.  Yeah I like a story but sometimes I just want the gore and the Devils Experiment delivers ten fold.  Why do people bash it.  Cause they like a story, so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story.  It make em feel better about themselves.  We all want blood and gore.  It is just really hard to justify it if it is not wrapped around a story.  The Guinea Pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released.I am thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world.  Maybe I should not have written this review but then again maybe I should.  My view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it is not.  I have always told people to find them and to watch them way before I started Unearthed Films.  Sure it is exploitive and over the top but is not that why we watch horror films in the 1st place.  The Devils Experiment is NOT for everybody.  It is for thrill seekers and gorehounds only.  If you think Jason movies and Freddy Krueger movies are awesome then stick to those.  But if your on the next level and have seen it all then the Devils Experiment is for you.  There is a reason why they have not been released for over 17 years.  They are wrong, disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom, unless she is totally cool.  Good luck, enjoy and never stop living your life.",

The Devils Experiment is NOT for everybody.  It is for thrill seekers and gorehounds only.  If you think Jason movies and Freddy Krueger movies are awesome then stick to those.  But if your on the next level and have seen it all then the Devils Experiment is for you.  There is a reason why they have not been released for over 17 years.  They are wrong, disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom, unless she is totally cool.  Good luck, enjoy and never stop living your life.",
		"Wow, alot of reviews for the Devils Experiment are here.  Wonderful.  My name is Steve and I run Unearthed Films.  We just started releasing the Guinea Pig films on DVD for North America.  Now before you ask why am I writing a review?  Instead ask why some people bash it.  I am writing this review because I love the Guinea Pig films.  Why do I love em, it is because they go for the throat and they do not let go.  I have seen it all.  Almost every horror film known to man, Argento, Fulci, Bava, Buttgereit. from every underground cult sensation to every Hollywood blockbuster.  I have seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the Guinea Pig films.  Why because it does not try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place.  This review is for the Devils Experiment.  I find it devoid of story which is fine by me.  Why do I watch horror films?  So I can see blood and gore and the torture of people.  The Devils Experiment not only delivers but that is all it is.  Pure unadulterated violence.  Yeah I like a story but sometimes I just want the gore and the Devils Experiment delivers ten fold.  Why do people bash it.  Cause they like a story, so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story.  It make em feel better about themselves.  We all want blood and gore.  It is just really hard to justify it if it is not wrapped around a story.  The Guinea Pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released.I am thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world.  Maybe I should not have written this review but then again maybe I should.  My view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it is not.  I told people Sure it is exploitive and over the top but is not that why we watch horror films in the 1st place.  The Devils Experiment is NOT for everybody.

		"A lot of people unfairly sh! t on this series but several of the Guinea Pig videos are fairly entertaining.  Devils Experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects worknot just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realisticespecially for the videos vintage and lowbudget.Let me start at the beginning now for those who do not know This film is an extreme torturefake snuff film that surfaced in Japan in the mid80s.  It is plot This entails brutal violenceall effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girls arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound.The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground.  These two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings.The actress who plays the victim of the experiment is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera.  Her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling.  Some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest.  Also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels till she pukes.If you have not seen this series I hope I have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot. 8.510 for Devils Experiment.",
		"First off, this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to. the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema, apparently its the other way around.  If one were to look back after the film it really was not meant to be convincing, it was a low budget ipecac.  But really thats all it was aiming for, it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original VHS versions.  I make me",
		"House had me I first saw it on video a few years back after reading Roger Eberts review, which proclaimed it the best film of 1987.  I had my doubts, mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year.  Boy, was I in for a surprise.  This was one of the smartest, most wellwritten movies I had ever seen.The screenplay is quite a piece of work, not only in terms of the plot which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out, but also in terms of character development.  On my second viewing, I began to realize that Mamets screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film, but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations.  The climax of the movie is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable.  It stems naturally from what we know about the characters, and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending.  The performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add enormously to the film.  I cannot picture any other actor besides Mantegna playing the role of Mike, and Crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset.  Their work, plus Mamets extraordinary screenplay, combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980s.  It is truly a mustsee.",

		"Plenty has been written about Mamets The House of Games; most of it good.  I viewing it The films success and durability probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film; a good story and a good scam.  Mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us, the audience, and the mark simultaneously.  Then he explains the art of conning only to do it again, etc. all the while building the story.  The House of Games, now a freebie on cable, is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for Mamet fans.  B",

		"This typical Mamet film delivers a quiet, evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man Joe Mantegna good.  Explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist Lindsay Crouse, it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences.  The cast includes a number of the players found is several of Mamets films Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H.  Macy, and they do their usual good job.  I loved Lindsay Perhaps I am not looking in the right places! The movie proceeds at a slow pace, with flat dialog, yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bangup ending.  You would expect a real let down at the ending, but I found it uplifting and satisfying.  I love this movie!",

A prim, proper female psychiatrist, hungry for adventure, meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals.  The vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman, and begs to be involved in his operation.  While the movie moves kind of slow, it is climax and ending are stunning!  You forgives herself",
		"I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1.  Richard Dean Anderson 2.  Amanda Tapping.  These two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors.  The replacement of RDA in seasons 910 was enough to take the heart out of the show.The chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous.  You stops rolling This relationship carries over into the program we get to see.RDA gives his ONeill character believable personality.  He never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest.  You watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances.  Still, they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous.There is a lot going on between Carter and ONeill under the surface.  They manage to keep the lid on, but often just barely.  The episode Solitudes in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television.  The love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together.Carter and Jackson often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by ONeill.  Yet ONeills tactical instincts always seem sound.  He understands what to do without having to think about the matter.  The team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders.The quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10.  The original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest.  Ben Browder was far inferior to RDA in carrying the show.  He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all.  Amanda Tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons.  You could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby.  She was probably thinking more about the child than the show.The spinoff Stargate Atlantis has a few moments, but is mostly a weaker effort.  The major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original.  The villains Wraiths are so improbable as to be ludicrous.  Maybe Amanda Tapping can breathe some life into the program or it will not last beyond the fourth season.There has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show.  To have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in SciFi.  The use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad.  The campy use of decor from ancient Egypt concealing ultramodern technology is just as hard to accept.I wondered about some of the continuity on the show too.  In the season 2 opener, Daniel Jackson is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded.  He crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet.

As mentioned, I am a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler.  She then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient, and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con.House of Games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout, and David Mamet does well in establishing his films setting in the underground levels of the city.  The film is well acted also, with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill.  Joe Mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film, and although his performance is a little under wrought, he is always solid and believable as the villain of the piece.  Lindsay Crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work, and again is believable in her role.  She may not be the greatest looker, but at least she can act.

		"Get ready for it This is one of my favourite films of all time.  I am relatively unaware of David Mamets writer and director other works but after having watched this film half a dozen timesit is always a joy to watch, I can say without hesitation that he is a genius.  This film is extremely well written, and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit, conartistry and back room hustles.  The feel of the film is very similar to The Sting 1973 and it also pays homage to film noir.It is quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters.  It is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch.Generally, the acting is superb especially Joe Mantegna but someone who I watched the film with remarked to me that it is not a good idea to have a heroine Lindsay Crouse who is not only a gambler, a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad 80s hairdo.  I think she Just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance.",
		"Opening the film with a Bach Toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama.  All the compositional devices Bach perfected to keep his listener and the performer intrigued and entertained applies to this film.  There is not a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene I feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad.  Mamet feel he If Mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders I wonder how this work would have ended?  As it exists it is very somber and mean spirited.",
		"House plot holes House Of Games does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do.  Of course, this is not a huge feat given the fact that we are dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate.  So it stands to reason that we never really know what is going on, even though we think that we do.  But that is what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game; a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities.It has a definite Hitchcock slant to it.  The film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort Marnie, considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the Masters more thoughtprovoking works.  One could easily consider the idea of Lindsay Crouses character being the same as Tippi Hedrins...ten year later perhaps.  Both are strongwilled loners, both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool.  As Crouses repressed, uptight character says, What is life without adventure?  Put your Reality Check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks!",

I recommend that you watch the movie first, then watch the first season of the TV series, then watch the movie again you will have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around, believe me, and then watch the rest of the TV series.The last three seasons of the series are not nearly as good as the first seven, but that does not mean they are not good.  It just means they are a letdown if you have gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons.After you have finished this series, be sure to watch the spin off series, Stargate Atlantis.

From the opening scene this movie just gets you.I am trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a FEW SPOILERS SO Do not READ ANYMORE IF YOU Do not WANT TO KNOW.I would say House of Games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists I have ever seenbar none.  From the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed.Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection, from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately.  Joe Mantegna was also wonderful.  The dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices.  I also loved the way the movie was filmed, in that grainy, surreal type of way, it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was.There were a few movies I have seen and loved that this reminded me of including The Grifters and The usual Suspects but really, House of games is completely different in it is way.  Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbing characters I have seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet, but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying.  You know somethings going to happen but you have no idea what.  And just when you think you have guessed what the something is, you realize you have not even scratched the surface....House of Games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature.  The character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well.  As the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters, we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it.  It is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it is conclusion.In closing, I would rank this 10 of 10, call it although not my absolute favorite film, pretty high on the list, most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best twists I have ever seen as well.

		"Heres my first David Mamet directed film.  Fitting, since it was his first, as well.  The story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie, from the little cons to the big cons to the allencompassing con.  It is like The Grifters, but without that films level of acting.  In that film, John Cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character.  The acting here is very flat I sometimes wondered if the bland acting by Crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis.  At least in the beginning.  It never gets really good, but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes.  Early in the film, some of Lindsay Crouses lines  the way she reads them  sound as if they are inner monologue or narration, which they are not.  With the arrival of Mantegna things pick up.The dialogue here is not as fun as it should be.  I expecting crackerjack It all sounds very read, rather than spoken.  Maybe Mamet evolved after this film and loosened up, but if not, then maybe he should let others direct his words.  He is far too precious with them here and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality.  What is more strange is that other than this, the film does not look or feel like a play.  The camera is very cinematic.  My only problem with Glengarry Glen Ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre, but in that film the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free.  Everything flowed.I would not mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines  or even play characters speaking play lines  but here it sounds like movie or even book characters speaking play lines.

How she gets involved is she is a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler.  She wants to help him out with his gambling debt, so she walks into The House of Games, a dingy game room where con men work in a back room.  I will admit the setup is pretty improbable.  Were they just expecting Crouse to come in?  Were they expecting she would write a cheque?  Was Billy in on it?  One of these questions is definitely answered by the end, however.And from here the cons are start to roll out.  I found the beginning ones  the little learner ones  to be the most fun.  We are getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as Crouse is.  We see the ending coming, and then we did not see the second ending coming, and then the real ending I did not see coming but maybe you did.  The ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second Crouse walked into The House of Games she found her true calling.I am going to forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange linereading because there are many good things here.

		"If your idea of a thriller is car chases, explosions, and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire, then House of Games is definitely not the movie for you.  If you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense, then, by all means, see it.House of Games tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer, Dr.  Margaret Ford Lindsay Crouse, who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic Mike Joe Mantegna.  To say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming.

		"If your idea of a thriller is car chases, explosions, and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire, then House of Games is definitely not the movie for you.  If you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense, then, by all means, see it.House of Games tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer, Dr.  Margaret Ford Lindsay Crouse, who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic Mike Joe Mantegna.  To say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming.  Just like a clever con artist, this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance.The story is taut and wellcrafted, the dialogue smart and laconic, the acting uniformly good Mantegna is superbly charismatic.  Some have complained that Dr.  Ford is not a very sympathetic character, and wondered why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse look so physically unattractive.  But Dr.  Ford is supposed to be cold and aloof; moreover, her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot at one point, I believe that an injury to her sexual selfesteem is a key part of her motivation ...  I will say no more.House of Games is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity.  It hold your",
		"House of Games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels.  It is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller.  It introduces Ricky Its dialogue, written by David Mamet, is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie in which reality is often in question an extra dimension of unrealness.On the face of it, House of Games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men, diametrically different from The Sting, which was played merely for glamour and yuks.  At this level it does succeed admirably.However, you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization.  The only movie I know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated Private Benjamin.  That thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus, hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of Goldie Hawn to chase after some easy laughs.  House of Games sticks to its business.  As Poe once said of a good short story, it drives relentlessly to its conclusion.There is another strain of moviesaboutwomen, epitomized by Thelma and Louise, a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed, whether or not they realize their inner strengths.  What tripe.As usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater.  It should be a natural for film festivals.  Nominate it for one near you if you get the chance.I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23 year old daughter.  Better she should see it on a TV than not at all.",
		"The United States of Kiss My AssHouse of Games is the directional debut from playwright David Mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller.  It stars Lindsay In doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels downtown to visit the lowlife place, House of Games.The gambler Mike played excellently by Joe Mantegna turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty.  He offers Crouses character a deal, if she is willing to sit with him at a game, a big money game in the backroom, he will cancel the patients debts.  The card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work gaining the trust of others and a fascinating relationship begins.  What makes House of Games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control, is it the psychiatrist or the conman or is it the wellknown man of great bluffs David Mamet.In House of Games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring, however in every David Mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings, not the direction.  In House of Games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads showy and distracting but mainly as is the case with much of Mamets work, it is the dialogue, which grips you and slowly draws you into the film.  No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words.  Everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order.  This is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension.  House of Games can also be viewed as a classwar division movie.  With Lindsay Crouse we have the middleclass, welltodo educated psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite, the working class of America earning a living by honest crime.The film seduces the viewer much like Crouse is seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema.  And the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for, it is stunning.An extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings. 910",

		"David Mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with House of Games, a character study fraught with psychological overtones, in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game.  Margaret Ford Lindsay Crouse has a successful practice and has written a bestselling novel, Driven.  Still, she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life; there is an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve, and it primes her vulnerability.  When a patient, Billy Hahn Steven Goldstein, confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers, and that they are going to kill him if he does not pay, she decides to intervene on his behalf.  This takes her to the House of Games, a seedy little dive where she meets Mike Joe Mantegna, a charismatic conman who wastes no time before enticing her into his world.  Instead of the twentyfive large that Billy claimed he owed, Mike shows her his book, and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars.  And Mike agrees to wipe the slate clean, if she will agree to do him one simple favor, which involves a card game he has going on in the back room.  In the middle of a big hand, Mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes; while he is gone, her job is to watch for the tell of one of the other players.  By this time, not only Margaret, but the audience, as well, is hooked.  The dialogue, and Mamets unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines, is mesmerizing.  As Mike leads Margaret through his compelling, surreal realm of existence, and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game, we are swept right along with her.  From that first memorable encounter, when he demonstrates what a tell is and how it works, to the lessons of the short con, to the stunning climax of this film, Mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless.  And nothing is what it seems.  In the end, Margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature, and about herself.  She changes; and whether or not it is for the better is open to speculation.  Mantegna lead you Crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here; you feel the rigid, uptight turmoil roiling beneath that calm, selfassured exterior, and when her experiences with Mike induce the change in her, she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated.  She makes you believe that she is capable of what she does, and makes you understand it, as well.  The dynamic supporting cast includes Mike Nussbaum Joey, Lilia Skala Dr.  Littauer, J.T.  Walsh The Businessman, Ricky Jay George and William H.  Macy Sergeant Moran.  House of Games is the quintessential Mamet; he is written and directed a number of highcaliber plays and films since, and will no doubt grace us with more in the future.  But this film will be the one that defines him; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up.  You will find it under Perfection.  This is one great movie you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 1010.",

		"This movie is amazing!  While being funny and entertaining, it is also profoundly deep and eyeopening.  I watch it Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life.  He has a job and a life, but it is not what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness.  Bruce is bitter, unsatisfied, and resentful that his life is not the way he envisions it should be.  As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing his job and blaming God for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life.  God comes to Bruce and grants him Godly powers.  Bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted.  His life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy.....with one exception.  In the process of gaining everything, he loses the one person who truly loved him.  As the movie unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances, but his perception of what was truly there.  This movie was inspirational and deep.  If you really pay attention, it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize.  As my wife says, Since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy?  and my humble addition, May we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out.",

		"I have to say, from the beginning, when i watched the Stargate movie movie i was not blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie, with a lot of POTENTIAL, though the movie was not as, erm, amazing as other sci fi movies such as Star wars or aliens, which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing, even though i am not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people, i do not remember one line from either of those movies, i am not a big fan of wearing star wars T shirts, in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you, ah getting slightly off the point here, well my point is that the that you do not have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series, which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end, in 2006.though i did not like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997, and let me tell you, the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series, the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects, were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today.

		"After a slow beginning, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny film that had something positive to say.  It was not one of Jim Carreys best performances, but he was still OK.  Morgan Freeman was just right as God.  Jennifer Aniston had some good moments.  I miss Steve I like director Tom Shadyacs choices of movies.  He also did LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS, and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR.  In all three of those and in Bruce Almighty, he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him.  A director who knows comedy, can get the talent he gets, and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find.My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references.  I only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie.  My guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references, but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people.  That is too bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity.My Grade7 out of 10",

I only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie.  My guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references, but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people.  That is too bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity.My Grade7 out of 10",
		"Bruce Almighty will sweep the Academy Awards with a record 14 Oscar wins!  It surpass Titanic Jim Carreys illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 White House playoffs.  Almighty then!  These grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers Carrey included would possess the powers of God.  That very same premise is the paramount ingredient in Carreys new laugh riot Bruce Almighty.  Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds God to total culpability for his own contretemps.  God, heavenly played by Morgan Freeman, grants Bruce the Gift of Godhis powers in order to challenge him if he can do Gods job any better.  Obviously, Bruce gets carreyed away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly.  Carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in Bruce Almighty.  Jennifer Aniston was not mis.pittiful as Bruces girlfriend.  However, my premier kudos goes to Director Tom Shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for 2, and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time!  Bruce Almighty is not the most indepth Carrey film, but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of Carreyism!   Good",

		"Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman along with Jennifer Aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season late May and a good improvement on Carreys past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies.  With a slightly toned down Carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self, Carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic, tearfully somber moments.  Elements acting abilities This delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons, including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script.  While still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedydrama, Bruce, Almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its goodnatured taste.  Eight out of ten stars.",

With a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself.I thought Jennifer Anistons character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards Carrys basically selfcentered TV anchorman wannabe but that is the way it was written.I think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened.I have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep.  This is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart.A funny film.",

From the extremely rushed end of the series, it is obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season.  My guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the Stargate SG1 franchise for the two upcoming directtoDVD moves!

		"I first heard about this film about 20 years ago when I was a kid in grade school! , it just so happened that I was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day, and under the entry for movies or cinema, I do not remember, were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental, and one of them shown on the page was a still for OffOn.  It intrigued me So when I was reading the notes on the DVD cases for the set, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn was on one of the discs.  After all these years, I could finally see the film!  After viewing it, it slightly was not was I was expecting it to be it tended to be a more organiclooking film, not that that is a bad thing, but I was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic, but it was still an impressive film, IMHO, considering the techniques Scott Bartlett used to make the film, including handtinting the film itself, and using video equipment for some of the films scenes filmed off of a video monitor, giving it a more distressed, lores look.Do not get me wrong, the techniques used in this film were quite groundbreaking for 1972.  That is why it is still one of my favorite shortexperimental films, and a creative inspiration for me as well...",

		"Starring Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was really quite skeptical the first time I watched this movie.  I mean, what a conceptual NIGHTMARE.  Jim Carrey playing God?  Nothing is sacred anymore.Well, this movie is hardly sacred, but it also is not sacrilegious, at least not to any great extent.  Yes, Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while, but he is not God.  Confused?  I give you He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace Anniston, and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other, but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground.Then Bruce gets a shot at anchorman, only to have it underhandedly stolen by Evan Baxter.  Obviously not please, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired.Much complaining and griping about God later, Bruce gets a page.  After a while he gets tired of it calling, so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building heh.  There he meets God Freeman, who is the Boss, Electrician, and Janitor of the building.  I found this highly amusing.  God is the Boss, the Holy Spirit is the Electrician, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor.  Think about it.  Boss, obvious.  Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running.  Janitor, the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left.  BRILLIANT.Anyway, Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing God, he starts to believe a bit.  Wonder why.  Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies.Since this is Hollywood, Bruce obviously eventually smartens up, learns his lesson, and starts using his powers for the good of the world.  In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done, not Bruces.Since it is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite amusing, and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it.  The movie is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it is definitely a good attempt.  Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this movie.So, while far from perfect, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it.Bottom Line 3.5 out of 4 worth a view or two",

		"Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck.  Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums and of course they have to be Mexican, obviously, his good will towards his fellow man backfires.  In that case, it was not too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but I like that the movie suggests that things like that should not be ignored.  I am reminded of the episode of Michael Moores brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay.  The results were not very promising, so it is nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example.Jim Carrey plays the part of Bruce Nolan, the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart.  Or even better, it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere a little metaphor that comes up when Bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film.  Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that is seeking to bake the worlds biggest cookie.  He loses his You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report.  Needless to say, he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film.Morgan Freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the Man himself, displaying a God whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through Freemans massive talent as an actor.  He is the kind of God who takes his job very seriously, but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life.  I love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day.  There are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in America who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans.One of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives, and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewers religion.  I, for example, tend to reject organized religion in all forms and I see God and Satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live.  But despite the fact that I do not believe that God exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time, I was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie.Jim Carreys movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he is come.  If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura both of which I loved, by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film, it is amazing how far he is come.  He has moved from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, and The Majestic easily one of his greatest films ever.  Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today.Jennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the sidesplitting Office Space as Bruces girlfriend, who becomes increasingly exasperated by Bruces growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him.  There is definitely some lowbrow comedy in the film that does not really fit with the importance of the films meaning or the quality of the delivery, such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene, but it was definitely pretty nice to see Ace Venturas friend Spike make a cameo appearance.  As Stephen King very well knows, it is always nice to see familiar characters.  It is almost like seeing family again.Bruce is endowed with the powers of God for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better, and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him.  The thing I love about this is that, like I said before, religion is absent from my life, but I was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things I would have done had I been endowed with such powers.  The movie allows us to learn vicariously this way, which empowers the message even more.The scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film, such as the scene when Bruce loses his temper about the anchor position, the Jimmy Hoffa scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records, the scene where Bruces rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera, and my favorites, the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakerys cooking.  The movie has plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent jokes, such as when he says to God who reveals that he is the janitor, the proprietor, the electrician, etc that his Christmas parties must be real bashes, and to be careful about drinking, because on of him might need a ride home!  I also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes.  A little too true, and as Gallagher would add, behind every great man is also an amazed motherinlaw.Bruce Almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while, and is probably the only directly religious that I can remember seeing that I am anxious to buy on DVD to add to my personal collection.

		"Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck.  Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums and of course they have to be Mexican, obviously, his good will towards his fellow man backfires.  In that case, it was not too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but I like that the movie suggests that things like that should not be ignored.  I am reminded of the episode of Michael Moores brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay.  The results were not very promising, so it is nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example.Jim Carrey plays the part of Bruce Nolan, the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart.  Or even better, it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere a little metaphor that comes up when Bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film.  Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that is seeking to bake the worlds biggest cookie.  He is desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station, but he loses his cool on live TV when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague.  You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report.  Needless to say, he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film.Morgan Freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the Man himself, displaying a God whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through Freemans massive talent as an actor.  He are times I love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day.  There are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in America who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans.One of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives, and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewers religion.  I, for example, tend to reject organized religion in all forms and I see God and Satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live.  But despite the fact that I do not believe that God exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time, I was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie.Jim Carreys movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he is come.  If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura both of which I loved, by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film, it is amazing how far he is come.  He has moved from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, and The Majestic easily one of his greatest films ever.  Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today.Jennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the sidesplitting Office Space as Bruces girlfriend, who becomes increasingly exasperated by Bruces growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him.  There is definitely some lowbrow comedy in the film that does not really fit with the importance of the films meaning or the quality of the delivery, such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene, but it was definitely pretty nice to see Ace Venturas friend Spike make a cameo appearance.  As Stephen King very well knows, it is always nice to see familiar characters.  It is almost like seeing family again.Bruce is endowed with the powers of God for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better, and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him.  The thing I love about this is that, like I said before, religion is absent from my life, but I was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things I would have done had I been endowed with such powers.  The movie allows us to learn vicariously this way, which empowers the message even more.The scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film, such as the scene when Bruce loses his temper about the anchor position, the Jimmy Hoffa scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records, the scene where Bruces rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera, and my favorites, the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakerys cooking.  The movie has plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent jokes, such as when he says to God who reveals that he is the janitor, the proprietor, the electrician, etc that his Christmas parties must be real bashes, and to be careful about drinking, because on of him might need a ride home!

		"China OBrien 1990 was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States.  This Golden Harvet production was helmed by veteran director Robert Clouse.  Sadly he was either lucky with Enter the Dragon or he is lost his touch because he is not that great of a director.  The only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of Ms.  Rothrock and Richard Norton.  If this movie was directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straighttovideo action flick.China OBrien returns home to help out her dad.  He needs her So she returns home and restores order with the help of two unlikely people.  But will they be enough to topple Mister Big and his evil cronies? If you are a big Cynthia Rothrock fan then this movies catered for you.  I only enjoyed the fighting scenes, everything else is rubbish.  Why did not Raymond Chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director? Recommended.",
		"This one and Her Pilgrim Soul are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of Twilight Zone.  As I mentioned in my comment on the new series, there is something lacking in this new series.  Maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned.  It is a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than Serlings version.  However, this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too.  I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, the lovers can never unite.  I remember I I think it is because I saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film.",

		"This a good episode of The New Twilight Zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories I note both of them are based on short stories.  Examination Day is set in the future, year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves, huge TVlooking phones that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age...and the Examination Day, a point where 12yearolds must undergo a governmentrequired IQ test.

		"You know how Star Trek fans flocked to all the Star Trek movies, even the really bad ones?  Why?  To see their heroes in action one more time.  That is the way I feel about Doc Savage.  I seeing Doc And the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation.  Then they decided to crib elements from a number of Doc adventures and throw them into this one movie, resulting in a somewhat disjointed film.  There is a lot of promise in here, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices the music, the camp elements, etc.  But the spirit of Doc is there, and that is what those of us familiar with Doc and his crew respond to.  So, in my longwinded way, what I am trying to say is that this is not a bad movie it is just not as good as it should have been.  And anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai, and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all.",
		"It has said that The Movies and Baseball both thrived during The Great Depression.  It appears that the grim realities of a Nation caught up in the aftermath of this Economic Disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace.  A temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is Baseball.Likewise, an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the Cinema.  The presence of a Radio in just about everyones house hold kept Depression Era America at once attuned to Worlds Events and provided many a Drama and especially Comedy Shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality.The literature of the time also flourished at all levels.  The juvenile reading habits helped to create the Comic Book as we know it, what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures.  But the Comic Book just did not magically appear, all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages, all by itself.  There were mediums that were ancestral to them.  Obviously,the Newspaper Comic Strip was one parent, providing the visualnarrative method of story telling.The other direct ancestor was the Pulp Magazine.  The inexpensive, prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going, though not necessarily serialized, tales.  The pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to Edgar Rice Borroughs TARZAN and Johnston McCulleys ZORRO.  The 1930s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like THE SHADOW, THE AVENGER, G8s BATTLE ACES and THE SPIDER,MASTER of MEN all found their way to the news stands, among many others.One other was DOC SAVAGE, a fullblooded super hero of the written story; the covers of the pulps had perhaps, the only picture of the hero.  Possessing extraordinary strength, super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect, Doc was the prototype Super Hero.He also assembled 5 of his former Army Buddies into a small, free lancing team of adventurers.  Each of them was an expert in a given field.  So we had a top rated Chemist, Lawyer, Construction Engineer, Electrical Engineer, GeologistArchaeologistPaleontologist, etc.The Doc Savage stories were very popular in the 1930s and 40s, and were published into the middle 50s.  Then they went into a hiatus for a good 1215 years.  Then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new container, the paperback book.  A fresh look to the cover art was introduced, featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular Doc, with a perpetually ripped shirt.The reintroduction proved to be highly successful, with the publication of a title a month and for a while more.  Soon, there was a rumor of a Doc Savage movie!  But when, by what Producer?  Well, the venerable Man of Bronze was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together.  It casted team With former Tarzan of TV,Ron Elys nearly perfect casting in the lead, up and coming Beauty of a Starlette, Pamela Hensley in the female lead and veteran character Paul Wexler as the villainous, Captain Seas; no other name would have been recognized.  And, just maybe that was a plus in this case.The story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going.  Use of narration, by Paul Frees, and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story.From the very start, there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured Camp humor as the Batman TV series.  Some really great looking early scenes involving Doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the Paul Frees narration and the unexpected, unlikely outcomes.  For Example, an experiment of Docs with a miniature rocketmissile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish, a small one at that.  The whole story unfolds like that, hitting the viewer with a little Camp every so often, as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously.  We are also puzzled about Mr.  George Pals being the Producerhis last.  He who had been so well known for Special Effects, surely a factor that could be put to good use in a scifi action setting of the Pulp Characters world.I can remember seeing it quite vividly.  Mrs.  Ryan Deanna was in the Hospital, just having given birth to our 2nd child, Michelle081475.  Our older girl, Jennifer, was visiting her Grandmother, so after visiting hours were over in the Maternity Ward, it was straight over to the old Marquette Theatre, 63rd  Kedzie, here in Chicago.Having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with Doc, I was sort of let down by the final product.  I could accept a little of this Camp business, but would not have objected if Mr.Pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat Dinosaurs and Volcanoes to give it all a little more PulpComicSerial type excitement.And yet, the cast, headedup by Mr.  Ely and the others, made the whole film likable, if not lovable.  The sets and locations were, as far as we can see, very much like those of a 30s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone.And maybe that is just what they were trying for with this DOC SAVAGE, MAN of BRONZE.",

		"It has said that The Movies and Baseball both thrived during The Great Depression.  It appears that the grim realities of a Nation caught up in the aftermath of this Economic Disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace.  A temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is Baseball.Likewise, an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the Cinema.  The presence of a Radio in just about everyones house hold kept Depression Era America at once attuned to Worlds Events and provided many a Drama and especially Comedy Shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality.The literature of the time also flourished at all levels.  The juvenile reading habits helped to create the Comic Book as we know it, what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures.  But the Comic Book just did not magically appear, all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages, all by itself.  There were mediums that were ancestral to them.  Obviously,the Newspaper Comic Strip was one parent, providing the visualnarrative method of story telling.The other direct ancestor was the Pulp Magazine.  The inexpensive, prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going, though not necessarily serialized, tales.  The pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to Edgar Rice Borroughs TARZAN and Johnston McCulleys ZORRO.  The 1930s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like THE SHADOW, THE AVENGER, G8s BATTLE ACES and THE SPIDER,MASTER of MEN all found their way to the news stands, among many others.One other was DOC SAVAGE, a fullblooded super hero of the written story; the covers of the pulps had perhaps, the only picture of the hero.  Possessing extraordinary strength, super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect, Doc was the prototype Super Hero.He also assembled 5 of his former Army Buddies into a small, free lancing team of adventurers.  Each of them was an expert in a given field.  So we had a top rated Chemist, Lawyer, Construction Engineer, Electrical Engineer, GeologistArchaeologistPaleontologist, etc.The Doc Savage stories were very popular in the 1930s and 40s, and were published into the middle 50s.  Then they went into a hiatus for a good 1215 years.  Then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new container, the paperback book.  A fresh look to the cover art was introduced, featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular Doc, with a perpetually ripped shirt.The reintroduction proved to be highly successful, with the publication of a title a month and for a while more.  Soon, there was a rumor of a Doc Savage movie!  But when, by what Producer?  Well, the venerable Man of Bronze was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together.  It was veteran Stopaction Animator and Producer of top Special Effects films, Geoprge Pal, who did the film along with Warner Brothers.When DOC SAVAGE, MAN OF BRONZE arrived in the Movie Houses, it boasted of a well casted team of actors, albeit a largely No Name as far familiarity with the viewers.  With former Tarzan of TV,Ron Elys nearly perfect casting in the lead, up and coming Beauty of a Starlette, Pamela Hensley in the female lead and veteran character Paul Wexler as the villainous, Captain Seas; no other name would have been recognized.  And, just maybe that was a plus in this case.The story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going.  Use of narration, by Paul Frees, and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story.From the very start, there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured Camp humor as the Batman TV series.  Some really great looking early scenes involving Doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the Paul Frees narration and the unexpected, unlikely outcomes.  For Example, an experiment of Docs with a miniature rocketmissile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish, a small one at that.  The whole story unfolds like that, hitting the viewer with a little Camp every so often, as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously.  We are also puzzled about Mr.  George Pals being the Producerhis last.  He who had been so well known for Special Effects, surely a factor that could be put to good use in a scifi action setting of the Pulp Characters world.I can remember seeing it quite vividly.  Mrs.  Ryan Deanna was in the Hospital, just having given birth to our 2nd child, Michelle081475.  Our older girl, Jennifer, was visiting her Grandmother, so after visiting hours were over in the Maternity Ward, it was straight over to the old Marquette Theatre, 63rd  Kedzie, here in Chicago.Having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with Doc, I was sort of let down by the final product.  I seen fit Ely and the others, made the whole film likable, if not lovable.  The sets and locations were, as far as we can see, very much like those of a 30s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone.And maybe that is just what they were trying for with this DOC SAVAGE, MAN of BRONZE.",
		"This series is set a year after the mission to Abydos in the movie Stargate.  It explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention.  Such as, how was the Stargate activated without a human computer?  Where did the Goauld Ras race come from?  How many are there?  The first episode has a retired Jack ONeill spelled with 2 Ls recalled to active duty by General George Hammond due to an attack by the shut down Stargate from Apophis, a powerful Goauld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman.  We meet Samantha We find out that Daniel got married on Abydos, and that there are hundreds of Gate addresses that they can dial.  Then Daniels wife gets captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen.  It continues in the second episode where General Hammond announces the formation of the SGC which includes nine teams, in which Jacks team will be SG1 which consists of Jack, Samantha and Daniel.  They go to Chulak, a Goauld homeworld to rescue Daniels wife and another one captured at Abydos named Skara.  They get captured, and just as Apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners, a Jaffa named Tealc, First Prime of Apophis, saves them and goes to Earth with them, where he is made part of SG1.  That was only the beginning of the adventure.  In the course of the show they have gone to the past and future, gotten transported to alternate realities, swapped bodies, grown old, met alien races which include a rebel alliance of Goauld called the Tokra, in which Samanthas Dad becomes a member, the Asgard, a cute little race in which we see Thor most often he is Jacks buddy,and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times.The show was recently canceled, but lasted ten seasons.  In season nine, a new enemy called the Ori came in flaunting brand new powers, new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the Stargate and its creators, the Ancients.  Season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters, Ben Browder as Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG1 and Claudia Black as Vala MalDoran, a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team.  Very wellproduced, interesting characters, fantastic Special effects and a subtle love interest between Samantha and Jack, this one has it all.  A different way of travelling the galaxy, and different kinds of adventures, this is one show you do not want to miss.  Unlock the gate and step through.  You will not regret it!",

		"Possible spoilersI recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences.  Ron Ely is just right as Doc.  Cool, calm, almost always in controland with an occasional twinkle in his eye.  What more can one ask for?  I have never read a Doc Savage book, so I do not know if it is faithful to the source but I enjoyed the light tone and derringdo.  Many people have compared this movie to Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I do not think is fair.  The difference in budget is astoundingRaiders must have at least 10 times the budget.  Doc Savage does not have the extensive location work that Raiders has.  Special effects are also at a minimum but come on people, the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right.  The Sousa music is catchylove that theme song Every time I watch the film, I end up humming the theme for days.The best way to approach this film is to just RELAX and enjoy.  Highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and Doc chase the Indian sniper throughout the rooftops of New York and the VERY funny fight sequence between Doc and Captain Seas.  Not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib really!.  Overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day.  I give it",
		"The problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the 60screated concept that comic books could only be done as camp i.e., the 60s Batman show for TV and movie.  Thus you have combat sequences with subtitles come on! , a cluelessly unromantic Doc Savage he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps, not an idiot, Monk Mayfair in a nightsheet a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights, and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a Herve Villechez posing for an Oscar statute.  And when they are not doing booming Sousa march scores, the tinkly little funny music undercuts much of the drama.Even as such, this movie is...okay.  It is fun Except for Monk, as has been mentioned before he is hugely muscled, not obese.  And Long Tom, who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude, not Paul Gleason with an inexplicable scarf.The Green Death sequences, for instance, are remarkably gruesome and not something I would recommend for children.  But they are very close to the feel of the pulps.  When the writers and producers get it right, they do get it right  I will give them that.But if the producers had done Doc with the loving care and scripting of, say, Reeves first two Superman movies, think what we might have had then.  I think the problem is the movies schizophrenic.  There is a definite sense of trying to do a 30s homage, but they are also trying to give in to the heroes must be camp attitude that Batman created.  One gets the impression there was a sober, pulpstyle first draft and then someone came in and said, Hey, let us make it funny  it worked with the Batman show 8 years ago! But Doc lives on, thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai.  If MacRauch as not doing a homage to Doc Savage in that movie, the man is truly demented.  So when the series actually gets on TV allegedly midseason in 9900, Doc Savage, updated to the 90s, will live once more.",
		"This is a VERY entertaining movie.  A few of the reviews that I have read on this forum have been written by people who, apparently, think that the film was an effort at serious drama.  IT WAS NOT All of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us.  The fight sequences are lively, brisk and, above all, not gratuitous.  The socalled Green Death, utilized on a couple of occasions, is not, as I read in one review, gruesome.  A couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between Doc and Seas near the end of the film.  Hey, lighten up...  Again, I remind one and all that this is a fun film.  Each phase of this fight was captioned, which added to the fun aspect.  The actors were not trying to emulate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan.  This is NOT one of those martial arts films.  Ron Ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play Doc.  Another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the bad guy Seas is dealt with.  I promise you that if you do not try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value, you will spend 100 minutes in a most enjoyable manner.",

		"The makers have chosen the best people for the job, and set the scene wonderfully.  Every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it.  Whether the period is the 20s the first story, the present ie 1950 for the middle story, or the 1910s the last, costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created.  I love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium  exquisite lace overlaid by the finest Shetland shawls.  Roland Culver as Ashenden is very appealing, but never mind the soppy young lovers, it is Raymond Huntley as the man who resents his wifes health and independence who harrows our emotions.  He usually played comical, pompous types, but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive.  The China Seas great 30s film starring Gable and Harlow stole the plot from the Mr Know All episode and also nicked a story by Kipling.  I wish we I love that posh bird who plays his wife, too.",

		"This is actually a trilogy of 3 of Somerset Maughams short tales.  The first one is The Verger, which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable.  After 17 years Albert Foreman is laid off from his church job because he cannot read nor write.  So what does he do?  Opens a tobacco shop, of course! The second is Mr.  KnowAll which was actually a story I had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten, until I heard the familiar introduction.  Another 15 minute one, and also very good.  It worked better on film than in a book for me, but then perhaps that is because I was only 14 the last time, afterall.The 3rd one is nearly a letdown.  Almost an hour in length, it simply drags.  It is not all that bad, but not as quick and snappy as the last 2.  I made sense Overall I give them 8, 9, and 6 out of 10, respectively.",
		"Made after QUARTET was, TRIO continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by Maugham.  Here the three stories are THE VERGER, MR.  KNOWITALL, and SANITORIUM.  The first two are comic THE VERGER is like a prolonged joke, but one with a good payoff, and the last more serious as health issues are involved.  Again the author introduces the film and the stories.James Hayter, soon to have his signature role as Samuel Pickwick, is the hero in THE VERGER.  He holds this small custodialtype job in a church, but the new Vicar Michael Hordern is an intellectual snob.  When he hears Hayter has no schooling he fires him.  Hayter tells his He has a good eye, and his store thrives.  Soon he has a whole chain of stores.  When his grandchild is christened by Hordern, the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his exVerger.  The payoff is when bank manager Felix Aylmer meets with Hayter about diversifying his investments.  I will leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting.According to Maugham he met a man like Max Kelada Nigel Patrick on a cruise.  In MR.  KNOWITALL Kelada is a splashy, friendly, and slightly overbearing type from the Middle East who is on a business trip regarding jewelry by steamship.  His stateroom mate is Mr.  Grey the ever quiet and proper Wilfred HydeWhite who is somewhat, silently disapproving of Max.  Max likes to enliven things, and soon is heavily involved in the ships entertainment.  At this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the nonMaugham story and film CHINA SEAS 1935, as Max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real.  I will not describe the way Max rises to the occasion.SANITORIUM is the longest segment.  Roland Culver plays Ashenden the fictional alterego of Maugham  a writer and one time spy as in Hitchcocks THE SECRET AGENT.  Here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health.  He finds a remarkable crew of people, including Jean Simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman, Finlay Currie as an irascible Scotsman, John Laurie as a second irascible Scotsman who is at war with Currie, Raymond Huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up, and Michael Rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness.  Culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions.  The last, dealing with Simmons and Rennie, is ironic but deeply moving.It was a dandy followup to the earlier QUARTET, and well worth watching.",

Hayter has saved some money, so he tells his wife Kathleen Harrison he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop.  He has a good eye, and his store thrives.  Soon he has a whole chain of stores.

His stateroom mate is Mr.  Grey the ever quiet and proper Wilfred HydeWhite who is somewhat, silently disapproving of Max.  Max likes to enliven things, and soon is heavily involved in the ships entertainment.  At this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the nonMaugham story and film CHINA SEAS 1935, as Max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real.  I will not describe the way Max rises to the occasion.SANITORIUM is the longest segment.  Roland Culver plays Ashenden the fictional alterego of Maugham  a writer and one time spy as in Hitchcocks THE SECRET AGENT.  Here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health.  He finds a remarkable crew of people, including Jean Simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman, Finlay Currie as an irascible Scotsman, John Laurie as a second irascible Scotsman who is at war with Currie, Raymond Huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up, and Michael Rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness.  Culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions.  The last, dealing with Simmons and Rennie, is ironic but deeply moving.It was a dandy followup to the earlier QUARTET, and well worth watching.",

		"This was a wonderful little American propaganda film that is both highly creative AND openly discusses the Nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed.  While late 1944 and into 1945 would reveal just how evil and horrific they were, this film, unlike other Hollywood films to date, is the most brutally honest film of the era I have seen regarding Nazi atrocities.The film begins in a courtroom in the futureafter the war is over the film was made in 1944the war ended in May, 1945.  In this fictitious world court, a Nazi leader is being tried for war crimes.  Wilhelm Grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal Grimms life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks.  At first, it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis.  However, after a while, it becomes very apparent that Grimm is just a sadistic monster.  These episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama.All in all, the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars secondtier actors.  There are many compelling scenes and performancesespecially the very prescient Jewish extermination scene towards the end that cannot help but bring you close to tears.  It use crosses Overall, it is a mustsee for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film.FYIThis is not meant as a serious criticism of the film, but Hitler was referred to as that paper hanger.  This is a reference to the myth that Hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper.  This is in fact NOT truepreviously he would been a starving artist, homeless person and served well in the German army in WWI.  A horrible person, yes, but never a paper hanger!",
		"Never viewed this film until recently on TCM and found this story concerning Poland and a small town which had to suffer with the Nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other European Cities for example Norway.  The First World War was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which War always creates.  Alexander Knox,  Wilhelm GimmGorky Park returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town.  He accept him As the Hitler party grew to power Wilhelm Grimm desired to become a Nazi in order to return and punish this small Polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind.  Marsha Hunt,Marja Pacierkowski,Chloes Prayer, played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with Whilhelm Gimm.  There are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the Nazi destroyed peoples families and their entire lives.  The cattle cars are shown in this picture with Jewish people heading to the Nazi gas chambers.  If you have not seen this film, and like this subject matter, give it some of your time; this film is very down to earth for a 1944 film and a story you will not forget too quickly.",
		"The only reason I give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because there are few movies, in my opinion, that are perfect.  This little B picture is a taut story, well told.  I seen him Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster.  He betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse.  The performance is one of the most chilling performances I have ever seen.  Since World War 2, actors who played Nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for Oscars.  I imagine that since this was made during the war, the Academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil.  But Knox puts in that kind of performancea man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer.  I still cannot get over it.Marsha Hunt, who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly, is cast against type in probably the best performance I have ever seen her give, too.  Maybe not Oscar worthy, but the best of her career.  Nothing against her; I have enjoyed her in those slight roles she often played.  But here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama.If you like human drama stories, or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis, I highly recommend this fine little film.",

Redd Foxx always a clown of comedy, Pearl Baily a great match as his wife witty and sassy, Norman a son with a secret not sure if he will have a future if it is out,Dennis Dugan crazy funny man .  Miss Dobson hooker with a heart and little conscience.  Love brought me This movie was a wild ride advise of a cabbie, remind me of episode Kramer takes advice of his caddie over his lawyer.   episode from Seinfeld  The parents have there jaw dropping moment, fun over fun It is screaming bring me back .",

Love,lust,strange family ties this movie qualifies for a come back encore performance ,situation comedy with a mix of events as this could and should find its way as a remake, I do think finding cast would be extremely difficult maybe impossible,except Jerry Seinfeld playing Dennis Dugan role, this earmarks a couple of Seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to Norman is that you ,keeping them in the closest was surely impossible as impossible to reform pretend hooker girl friend and infidelity of a parent.

		"Norman, Is That You?  was this is all third hand, so take it with a grain of salt adapted to an African American family from a Jewish one, when it made the transition off stage and onto screen.  Also, it was one of those movies originally filmed in video, so the prints from the theater cannot have been that great.  Still, performances by Redd Foxx and others were pretty good.  What I wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a PERIOD PIECE it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early 70s about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family.  For that reason alone, it is pretty interesting if not a little hollywood.  Do not believe me?  Check out lines about curtains, etc.  Very stereotypical.  Not too deep.But... the movie really shines in a couple of areas.  There is a side splitting scene when Redd Foxx is trying to find his wife, who is run away with his brother !  to Ensenada in a souped up Pinto.  The phone conversation across the border is really memorable.  But... the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did histheir gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs.  To the best of my knowledge, this is the only time that routine was filmed.  And, it is a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version, I am told.  Still, it is vintage Madame, and should not be missed.  People stealing lines Enjoy the movie!",
		"I featuring AfricanAmericans It looked like what it is; a highly tendentious wacky comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay.  It would seem that Redd Foxxs RF wife has left him for his brother, who works with him at the store back in Phoenix.  He has taken the bus to visit his son Norman is Los Angeles.So as RF arrives, Norman, wearing nothing but powderblue bikini shorts, gets out of his waterbed to answer the door.  Trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake his lover, who steadfastly refuses to budge.  It was just to the point where I wrote WHY will not he wake up?  when suddenly he does, and me and my friends jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blueeyed, swirlhairdoed Garson, Normans white livein lover, who just had the most faaaaaabulous dream Garson is a flaming queen of a type that can ONLY be imagined as emerging from 1976 L.A.  He has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry, and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on Carol Brady from The Brady Bunch.Norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his fathers visit.  Garson goes to stay with Waylon Flowers, and Madam answers the phone when Norman calls.  So RF attempts to reach his wife in Mexico.  While he is on the phone, Garson comes in to pack his dress and RF confronts him.  With a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation but sounding more like we are about to hear a very special track by The Emotions, he realizes that his son is gay.His first impulse is I will kill him.  I will kill him.  Then RF goes on a long walk, wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have, such as maybe we toilet trained him too soon.  His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk, for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man.  Surprisingly, he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality.  This, it must be said, is about eight more books on homosexuality than MY parents bought.  He then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all!  RF then hires Audrey, a sixfoot Amazon prostitute in this amazing fur thing played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones.  He hired her for Norman to try out heterosexuality, but this pisses Norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend Melody.Then Garson comes over and offers to take RF out for the night.  He commiserates over the loss of RFs wife, and tells the tale of his own mother, who harbors an irrational prejudice against Pilippinos because she was molested at a luau.  They attend a long featured performance of Wayon and Madam, which culminates in Madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose.  Once more, mouths were agape.So it seems that, would not ya just know it, RF and Garson have a wonderful evening together!  You see, staid, traditional older black men just have to see the crappy, highlyeffeminate entertainment of megaqueens in order to come around to ALL the gay world has to offer!  It is really JUST that simple!  This still does not prevent RF from yelling Rape!  when Garson wakes him from a bad dream.  It ends less predictably than you would think.There was so much that was just off.  WHAT is the basis of Norman and Garson s relationship?  They do not seem to have ANY rapport, and Norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking Garson out, and even when he comes around to stand up for himself, he never defends Garson or talks about their relationship.  There were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like RF going to buy all those books on homosexualityand sitting right down on the park bench to read them!  I like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality, rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends.Other than that, it is kind of just what it seems like a little relic of a bygone era, an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance, we could all learn to love and understand one another!  And because of the whole naivet? of this thing, the extreme stereotypes and messageladen dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated, and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years.  I guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays female friends are desperately in love with them, and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with, and by extension convert, them.

It was just to the point where I wrote WHY will not he wake up?  when suddenly he does, and me and my friends jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blueeyed, swirlhairdoed Garson, Normans white livein lover, who just had the most faaaaaabulous dream Garson is a flaming queen of a type that can ONLY be imagined as emerging from 1976 L.A.  He has dresses Garson goes to stay with Waylon Flowers, and Madam answers the phone when Norman calls.  So RF attempts to reach his wife in Mexico.  While he is on the phone, Garson comes in to pack his dress and RF confronts him.  With a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation but sounding more like we are about to hear a very special track by The Emotions, he realizes that his son is gay.His first impulse is I will kill him.  I will kill him.  Then RF goes on a long walk, wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have, such as maybe we toilet trained him too soon.  His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk, for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man.  Surprisingly, he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality.  This, it must be said, is about eight more books on homosexuality than MY parents bought.  He then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all!  RF then hires Audrey, a sixfoot Amazon prostitute in this amazing fur thing played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones.  He hired her for Norman to try out heterosexuality, but this pisses Norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend Melody.Then Garson comes over and offers to take RF out for the night.  He commiserates over the loss of RFs wife, and tells the tale of his own mother, who harbors an irrational prejudice against Pilippinos because she was molested at a luau.  They attend a long featured performance of Wayon and Madam, which culminates in Madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose.  Once more, mouths were agape.So it seems that, would not ya just know it, RF and Garson have a wonderful evening together!  You see, staid, traditional older black men just have to see the crappy, highlyeffeminate entertainment of megaqueens in order to come around to ALL the gay world has to offer!  It is really JUST that simple!  This still does not prevent RF from yelling Rape!  when Garson wakes him from a bad dream.  It ends less predictably than you would think.There was so much that was just off.  WHAT is the basis of Norman and Garson s relationship?  They do not seem to have ANY rapport, and Norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking Garson out, and even when he comes around to stand up for himself, he never defends Garson or talks about their relationship.  There were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like RF going to buy all those books on homosexualityand sitting right down on the park bench to read them!  I like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality, rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends.Other than that, it is kind of just what it seems like a little relic of a bygone era, an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance, we could all learn to love and understand one another!  And because of the whole naivet? of this thing, the extreme stereotypes and messageladen dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated, and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years.  I guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays female friends are desperately in love with them, and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with, and by extension convert, them.

		"I saw a trailer for this on Afro Promo, the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring AfricanAmericans.  It looked like what it is; a highly tendentious wacky comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay.  It would seem that Redd Foxxs RF wife has left him for his brother, who works with him at the store back in Phoenix.  He has taken the bus to visit his son Norman is Los Angeles.So as RF arrives, Norman, wearing nothing but powderblue bikini shorts, gets out of his waterbed to answer the door.  Trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake his lover, who steadfastly refuses to budge.

As Fanny says, We have been shaken out of the magnolias.In todays political climate where, led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used 911 to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings, we sunk to the level of the 911 murderers to seek bloodthirsty vengeance.

I am not comparing George Bush to Adolph Hitler.  But, I am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror, hatred, and hypernationalism to do despicable things.Sadly, the blackmailer, who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement, no matter how immoral, is most like the leaders of our country, those who support them, and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand, that they cannot even be bothered to vote.A film like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be  a force for the betterment of humanity  and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals.Geoff",

		"Even though this movie came out a year before I was born, it is definetely one of my favorite comedies.  It stars Redd Like most parents, he does not know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like.  His son, Norman, is now grown up and living on his own.  When his father, Ben, finds out that his son is gay, he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him.  The title comes from one of the funniest lines in the moviewhen Ben gets to Normans apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks it is his son in drag Norman...  Is that you?.  The movie had me laughing from start to finish.  Redd Foxx is great.  Although a lot of the content is stereotypical, I did not find anything offensive about the way the material was handled, and it even has a good ending.  Highly recommended.",

I read the review before watching this title and I do not know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came from.

		"This is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all.  Generally speaking, I am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories.  And this one is GREAT!  Besides Meryls performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise, the movies greatest asset is the story it is based on.  The riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture, after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eyeopening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans, and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society.  It shut their The other face of the socalled civilized society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings needless to say, this is very general, even though this specific tale unfolds in Australia, that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty.  Must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thoughtprovoking.",
		"I elevate it The film is set in 1940just before the entry of the US into the war.  Paul Lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family.  He is a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture.  Bette Davis is his very understanding and longsuffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time.  As the film begins, they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years, they are going to relax and stop running.The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decentmaking them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems.  While this had a very noble goal at the time, it just seems phony today.  In particular, the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just did not ring true.  It sounded more like antiFascism speeches than the voices of real children.  They were as a result extremely annoyingparticularly the littlest one who came off, at times, as a brat.  About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them though he had no discernible accent.It is really tough to believe that the ultrafamous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog, as it just does not sound true to life.  The story was based on the play by his lover, Lillian Hellman.  And, the basic story idea and plot is good,...but the dialog is just bad at times.

		"When the Chamberlain family is camping near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain Meryl Streep sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience.

Lindy thinks she Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain, a SeventhDay adventist pastor, who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife.  It is good or bad to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the States too, because the Australian public does not believe the story and the media only fans the flames.  Eventually, Lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor, but years later, a missing piece of evidence shows up and she is freed, but not until after the familys life is basically ruined.

		"A CRY IN THE DARK A CRY IN THE DARK was a film that I anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid, if unremarkable film.  This assumption came from the fact that aside from Streeps Best Actress nomination, the movie received little attention from major awards groups.Little did I anticipate that A CRY IN THE DARK would be such a riveting drama, wellconstructed on every level.  If you ask me, this is an underappreciatted classic.The film opens rather slowly, letting the audience settle into the Chamberlains at a relaxed pace and really notice that, at the core, they are an incredibly loving, simple family.  Fred Schepisi the director selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy, while also showing the attentive bliss with which Lindy Streep and Michael Sam Neill Chamberlain care for their children.While the famous line A Dingo Took My Baby!  has become somewhat of a punchline these days, the movie never even comes close to laughable.  The actual death of Azaria is horrifyingly captured.  It suspects Lindy As an audience member, I was fully invested in the Chamberlains plight... and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media.  But at the same, the mediapublic opinion is understandable.  I loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic, but they always had valid reasons to hold their views.The final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas.In terms of performances, the only ones that really matter in this film are those of Streep and Neill... and they deliver in every way.  For me, this ranks as one of if not 1 Meryl Streeps best performances.  For all her mastery of different accents which of course are very impressive in their own right, Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters.  I find this to be one of Streeps more subtle performances, and she hits it out of the park.

		"In August 1980 the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents Lindy and Michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation.  The media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood.  What followed was a gross miscarriage of justice.Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that while camping near Ayers Rock, central Australia, that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area.  Noone believed them Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and Michael as an accessory after the fact.  The whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing.  The Chamberlains trial was over before it began.Lindy never proved her innocence, so she was found guilty.  There was never enough evidence to convict her, yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure.  How could we as a nation even sit in judgement?  From where we are, how could we possibly presume to know?  Unless there was absolute proof, and no reasonable doubt whatsoever, the Chamberlains should have been acquitted.Fred Schepisis film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of John Brysons novel, that the Chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them.  That in fact a dingo did take baby Azaria on that fateful night at Ayers Rock.Schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation, hell bent on the truth being brought to light.  He shows Australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the Chamberlains pay!  His screenplay, cowritten with Robert Caswell, vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred.The outstanding Meryl Streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts.  She brings to life most convincingly the tough little Aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight.  Even her accent is almost, but not quite, spot on.  A very good effort by the master of that trade.  Sam Neill is every bit as good as Streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned Michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart, and he starts to question his Christianity.  His, as was Streeps, is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly.  The entire support cast are also excellent, with some of Australias finest actors and actresses playing a part.Technically the film is brilliant too, with Director of Photography Ian Baker capturing this great land with splendour especially the Rock.  Editor Jill Bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged, while Bruce Smeaton provides a telling score.For all Aussies this is a must see, a shocking look in the mirror if you will, at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served, and the truth to be known.  As Michael Chamberlain said  I do not think anybody really understands what innocence means.....to innocent people.Saturday, May 20, 1995  VideoEven on return viewings Fred Schepisis account of the travesty of justice that befell the Chamberlains, who lost baby Azaria at Ayres rock in 1980, is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving.Schepisi and Robert Caswell have expertly transferred John Brysons novel to the screen, telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, whose new born daughter Azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down.Amid media speculation and vicious public rumour Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and Michael was charged as an accessory after the fact.  What followed was little more than trial by media, and with the Australian people determined she be put away, Lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence.Meryl Streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles Australia head on to prove her innocence.

		"I found it The central characters, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, whose daughter disappears during a night out in the Australian outback, are not bad people, but then surely not all, or even most, of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better.  But though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the Chamberlains from the start of their lifes tragic disarray, the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip, news media, crowds, mobs and assumptions.  It is not a movie about the degenerate society of Australia in particular; it is merely an account of a true story that happened there.  Society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are.When a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigines dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog, when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines, newspapers and TV programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy, there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of ones own unaware perceptions, influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround ones life.  The reason I appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out, from the victims to the masses.The evidence against Lindy Chamberlain aside, suspicion was jetfueled mostly by a virtue of hers.  To the public eye, she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter.  Why was she able to keep her cool, even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up, for TV and the press?

		"I found it hard to like anyone in this film.

But though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the Chamberlains from the start of their lifes tragic disarray, the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip, news media, crowds, mobs and assumptions.

		"I thought it Several years later I see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie.  The story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself.  The cast just makes it that much more appealing.  Meryl Streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture.  She nails Mrs.  Chamberlains mannerisms, the accent, and even look.  She shows the pain, hurt, surprise, and anger that Lindy had to endure, and in the process it is hard to remember that it Is not Lindy.  In my opinion, this performance of Meryls was better than her Oscarwinning turn in Sophies Choice, and should have garnered her her third Oscar.  Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain, and for some surprising reason, was not recognized by the Academy with at least a nomination.  In all, this movie only receive ONE Oscar nod Streeps for Best Actress.  However, it did receive several Australian Oscars and nominations.Definitely a toprate movie it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast.",

Mrs.  Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was not particularly likable, nor all that smart.  But that just makes Streeps work all the more remarkable.  I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nominations.  About the film, well, there were a couple of interesting things.  I do not know much about Australia, but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story.  I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday.  And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at miseryinducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues.  A pretty good film.  A bit different.  Grade B",

I think she Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three kids are leaving Mexico and coming into the United States in the first scene of the movie.  They are going by train to Daviss relatives house.  Davis and Lukas were in the underground to stop the Nazis so they are very tired and need rest.  But when they arrive home, their is a Nazi living there and theirs not much either can do about it.  It turns out the Nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with Lukas.  Their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself.",

Based on the book Evil Angels and titled so in its Australian release, A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch.  It presents a scenario that is all too real for us in America the witchhunt against a person deemed an easy target.Lindy Chamberlain was this woman.  Being someone who spoke her mind, someone who did not play the sympathy card, and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal, she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she did not kill her own child.  The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece.  And through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as ever, even when her husband Michael was falling apart.This stance, of course, is the power of strength, as unsympathetic as it may look like, and people happen to react strongly to that.  They want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn, not sit there and look blank.  People begin speculations Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold, but not unfeeling woman, one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty.  Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair  someone has to, or the Chamberlains would be too detached, and no one wants to see that.

		"Spoilers knowing nothing Just to give the press and the Austrialian people a break here, I was quite far into it before I began to question the Chamberlains guilt.  The author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did.  John Bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors and picked up by the press of the arterial spray, the actelone ??  plates, Dr.  James Camerons certainty that the collar was cut with scissors, that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up, bloody hand print, etc. all quite convincingly.  After all, these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie, and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong was not apparent to me at all.  It was also highly technical evidence, difficult for a layman to understand.  To this point, beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials, hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human; people did not believe it was possible.  The public was suspicious of the Seventh Day Adventists, whose origins made them appear to be a cult, and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt.  Were it not for dedicated, selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony, finding Azarias clothes later would not have been enough to get Lindy out of jail.  The book shook me for that reason, and I have been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyones guilt ever since excepting OJ of course.  I was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and do not think it could have been done better.  I have always liked Sam, who I could identify with completely, and Meryl was perfect as always.  Beautiful photography, haunting music.  I think it is not only a very good, but a very important, movie.  Too bad it did not receive more publicity at the time it was released.",

		"Lindy Meryl Streep and her husband Michael Sam Neill have just welcomed a baby girl, Azaria.  As Seventh Day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day and soon have Azaria dedicated to God at their church, with their two older boys looking on.  Michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to Ayers Rock, one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of Australia.  Not being wealthy, the family camps near the site.  After a wonderful first day, Lindy puts baby Azaria to sleep in one of the tents.  Suddenly, she hears Azaria crying.  As Lindy rushes to the tent, a dingo dog is just exiting, shaking his head.  The baby is gone and soon, so is the dingo.  Although the entire camp looks for the baby, she is not found.  Concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child, the Chamberlains struggle to accept Gods decision and go on with their lives.  But, unfortunately, the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that Lindy murdered the baby.  She is subsequently arrested and put on trial.  How could this happen?  This is a great depiction of real events that shows how mob rule is not a figment of the imagination.  The entire country turns against the Chamberlains, in part because they are seen as odd.  Streep gives her Neill, likewise, does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused Michael.  The cast is one of the largest ever, with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into Lindys case.  The costumes, scenery, script, direction and production are all top of the line.  If you have never seen or heard of this film, remedy that straight away.  It is not a far cry from reality to say that this Cry should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media.",
		"An unqualified 10.  The level of writing and acting in this Australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of old Hollywood.  Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together.  Neill matches Streep This engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama, portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms.  The movie  which won several top awards in Australia  boasts not only a superlative cast and director, but wonderful and authentic Australian locales.  It proves that people are the same the world over.  And, after all these years, people still delight in repeating the famous Streep line, accent and all A dingo ate moy baby!  Including that imp Elaine Benis on Seinfeld.",
		"When I first saw A Cry in the Dark, I had no idea what the plot was.  But when I saw it, I was shocked at what it portrayed.  When I saw it a second time in an Australian Cinema class, I realized a second point communication issues.  You show it As Seventh Day Adventists, they believed that God willed this to happen, and so they could not mourn it.  But when people all over Australia saw their lack of sadness, everyone started believing that Lindy did it herself.The point is, the wrong message got communicated to the public, and it turned people against Lindy.  Even though this was a pure accident, it still happened.  It may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media, regardless of any media outlet us political views.As for the performances, Streep does a very good job with an Australian accent no surprise there, and Sam Neill is equally great.  You will probably get blown away just by what you see here.  Definitely one of Fred Schepisis best movies ever.",
		"Meryl Streep was incredible in this film.  She has an amazing knack for accents, and she shows incredible skill in this film overall.  I really felt for her when Lindy was being persecuted.  She was played realistically, too.  She continued their I did not expect much from the film initially, but I really got interested in it, and the movie is based on a real person and real events.  It turned out to be better than I had anticipated.  Sam Neill was also outstanding; this is the best work I have seen from him, and I have really liked him in other movies The Piano, for example.  I gave the film a 7, but if I could rate just the acting, I would give the it a 9.5, and a perfect 10 for Streep.",

Simpson debacle although I have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation.The Australian news media, if this movie is to be believed, devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth was left as an afterthought.  It swarming media I do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case the accused are SevenDay Adventists.Today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more important.Streep is excellent as usual, and this is the best I have ever seen Sam Neill.  The Aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible.",

		"The previous reviewer has said it exactly.  I saw it I still remember some of the scenes.  The setting is the opening of the 20th century, the war referred to in the title is World War I.  One of the scenes was set in a womenonly section of a public place, which was an interesting historical note.  The moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my alltime great movie moments.  I do not think of this as a gay movie, it is an interesting and tender period love story, where the two principals happen to be women.  I would love to see this movie again; I would buy this one if it ever came out on DVD.",

		"As with all the other reviewers, this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years.  I recall going to the library researching all that I could on this story.  I even wrote to the PBS station for more information.  Despite all this, all I was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the 1900s.Fastward to 2002, after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was, a VHS copy of the movie.  There was one other bidder but I was determined to win this movie.  The losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which I gave her.  Despite owning a copy, I still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a DVD copy of the movie.  You find it",
		"I saw this movie in 1976, my first year of living in New York.  I went on to live there for the next 26 years,but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small TV movie.  It was part There are no sex scenes to speak of, just delicate, moving, extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement, all set within a conservative, Boston I think, World War 1 environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war, and did not seek out a career and financial independence.  Frances Lee McCain is superb in the role of career photographer and I have spent the next 30 odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail.There has to be a video of this movie?  Sure it should be on DVD but surely at least a video?",
		"Almost 30 years later I recall this original PBS film as almost unbearably tender.  Periodically, I check here at IMDb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a DVD.  It is September But nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced, as I recall it, on a shortlived PBS series which showcased original screenplays by new and upandcoming playwrights.I watched it every time it was shown on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times.  That was before the era of VCRs, so I have no record of it, except in my minds eye.12312006 addition to above Happy New Year, ladies!  This wonderful film is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org.  My understanding is that the DVDs are burned from the writers own personal copy.",
		"It is been a while since I have watched this movie, and the series, but now I am refreshing my memory!  This was a very funny movie based on the classic series!  Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were hilarious together.  Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse run Moonshine in the General Lee.  When Boss Hogg forces the Dukes off their farm, Bo and Luke sneak around Hoggs local construction site and find samples of coal.  They stop him My only two problems with the movie was that Burt Reynolds was not right for the part of Boss Hogg, and Sheriff Rosco P.  Coltrane was way too serious.  Other than that, I highly recommend THE DUKES OF HAZZARD!!!",

Of course the film is not a masterpiece, i do not think it was aiming to be.  It was fun The movie seats were practically shaking, and the car sequences were good because it did not bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious. and jessica Simpson is plain hot, i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences.

		"Having read some of the other comments here I was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised.  REALITY CHECK The original series was not that good.  I remember it The Duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks, the shrunken Boss Hog was too cretinous to be evil and Rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment.  It is amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series.Back to the movie.  If you watch this film in it is own right, not as a direct comparison to however you remember the TV series, then it is not bad at all.  The real star is of course the General Lee.  The car chases and stunts are excellent and that is really what D.O.H. is all about.  Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with Seann William Scott as Cousin Bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious DumbAndDumber sort of way the TV series never achieved.  The lovely Jessica Simpson is a natch as Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds makes a much improved Boss Hog and M.C.  Gainey makes a believably nasty Rosco P.  Coltrane, the way he always should have been.If you do not like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you would not be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect.  Otherwise if you want an entertaining caraction movie with a few good laughs that is not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind.",

It is a true shame it is not as wellknown as the former films maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or scifi settings, and that it is British, meaning a smaller market for films but its wonderful to know that it is deserved that reputation.Like all great family films, one can be a child, an adult, or even a teenager to enjoy this film I am currently 18, but one must appreciate classic films first.

		"The making of The Thief Of Bagdad is quite a story unto itself, almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film.  Alexander Korda nearly went broke making this film.According to the Citadel Film series Book about The Great British Films, adopted son of the United Kingdom Alexander Korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation.  But World War II unfortunately caught up with Korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle.Budget costs happen in US films too, only Cecil B.  DeMille always had a free hand at Paramount after 1932 when he returned there.  But DeMille nor any of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film.  Part of the way through the shoot, Korda transported the whole company to America and shot those sequences with Rex Ingram as the genie in our Grand Canyon.  He get scenery Korda also finished the interiors in Hollywood, all in time for a release on Christmas Day 1940.The spectacle of the thing earned The Thief Of Bagdad four Academy Award nominations and three Oscars for best color cinematography, best artset direction for a color film, and best special effects.  Only Miklos Roszas original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category.  Korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the Grand Canyon because it is impossible to get bad color pictures from that place.The special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil.  The good is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez and the evil is Conrad Veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart, both belonging to Duprez.  This was Veidts career role until Casablanca where he played the Luftwaffe major Stroesser.  Of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source.  Beggar boy and thief Sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star.  Literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the Maharajah of Mysore he was spotted by Alexander Korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features.  Sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the Arabian Nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant.  Not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that.The Thief Of Bagdad holds up remarkably well today.  It is an eternal tale of love, romance, and adventure in any order you want to put it.",

DeMille always had a free hand at Paramount after 1932 when he returned there.  But DeMille nor any of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film.  Part of the way through the shoot, Korda transported the whole company to America and shot those sequences with Rex Ingram as the genie in our Grand Canyon.  He certainly was not going to get scenery like that in the UK.  Korda also finished the interiors in Hollywood, all in time for a release on Christmas Day 1940.The spectacle of the thing earned The Thief Of Bagdad four Academy Award nominations and three Oscars for best color cinematography, best artset direction for a color film, and best special effects.  Only Miklos Roszas original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category.  Korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the Grand Canyon because it is impossible to get bad color pictures from that place.The special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil.  The good is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez and the evil is Conrad Veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart, both belonging to Duprez.  This was Veidts career role until Casablanca where he played the Luftwaffe major Stroesser.  Of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source.  Beggar boy and thief Sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star.  Literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the Maharajah of Mysore he was spotted by Alexander Korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features.  Sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the Arabian Nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant.  Not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that.The Thief Of Bagdad holds up remarkably well today.  It put it",
		"Although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special.If you have never seen this film before you will be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers.  I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disneys Aladdin cribbed from the film.  They loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers.I have given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten, which is where a good portion of this film dwells, because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing.  Everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end.  From the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting.  It weaken it.Still",
		"This was a favorite of my childhood  I can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time.  Now that I am grown up and have a kid of my own, I wanted to introduce him to this classic movie.  We watched it During Abus fight with the giant spider, my sons hand crept over and took hold of mine  he was genuinely scared.  Is he gonna beat the spider, Poppa?  Just watch, you will see.  He has no historical frame of reference to speak of eight years old, so Bagdad under the grandson of Haroun alRaschid might as well be Oz under Ozma.I think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derringdo were perpetrated by the boythief, and not the grownup king.  In fact, if you deconstruct the films narrative a bit, the king is the thiefs sidekick, not the hero at all  which must be very satisfying to imaginative, adventurous young boys.  It is definitely a period piece  I suspect that by the time he is eleven or twelve, my son will find it corny or whatever word the next generation will be using by then.  The love story is barely onedimensional  as a cynical friend commented, Why does Ahmad love the Princess?  Because the narrative demands it.  The willingness of Abu to put himself in jeopardy repeatedly for the clueless, lovestruck deposed king is equally improbable.  But to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses, fiftyfoot genies and the Temple of the AllSeeing Eye would be fatuous in the extreme.  The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movies climax is tremendous, as is the final shot of Abu triumphantly flying away on his stolen magic carpet, seeking some fun, and adventure at last!",

I loved this film from the first moment I saw it, when I was a boy of six who had started reading The Arabian Nights.  I remember walking into the TV room in the middle of Sabus battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled.Rarely has so much beauty, magic, and wonder been captured on film.  Sabu and John Justin are superb as the dashing heros, Conrad Veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain Jaffar, and Rex Ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie.  Georges Perinals photography is some of the best use of Technicolor.  One of the three credited directors is Michael Powell, a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films, including A Matter of Life and Death aka Stairway to Heaven and The Red Shoes.  He is one of the true masters of the camera, right up there with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa, and Orson Welles.As with all great works of art, the beauty of The Thief of Bagdad lies in the detail.  Every frame has its own magical charm.  The story never lags, and the characters and their actions are always involving.  Here is a film that will never grow old.",

Several years later, I realized how much of the satire and wit of the script I had missed on that first viewing.  I have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years.

The malignant vizier Jaffar magnificently played by Conrad Veidtwith powerful magic faculties imprisons the prince Ahamad of Bagdadattractive John Justinwho loses his throne, then he escapes thanks a little thief named Abusympathetic Sabu.  They arrive Basora But prince and thief are haunted by Jaffar , Ahamd is turned blind and Abu is become a dog.  The story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as transformation of the starring, a flying mechanic horse, magic bow, flying carpet and of course the colossal genieoveracting performed by Rex Ingram who gives three wishes to Sabu , the magic eye, the figure of goddess Kali with several hands, among others.This remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time.  Produced by London Fims Alexander Korda and directed by the definitively credited Ludwing Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan with a stunning screenplay by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson also dialogs writer and actor as Sultan fond to mechanic games.  The WWII outbreak caused the paralyzing shooting, then the three Korda brothers and collaborators traveled USA continuing there the filming in especial on Grand Cannon Colorado.The splendid visual and glimmer Technicolor cinematography , setting and FX provoked the achieving three Oscars  Production design by William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda ,Cinematography by George Perinal and Special effects by Osmond Borradaile though today are dated and is urgent a necessary remastering because the colors are wornout.  Furthermore one nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score by Miklos Rozsa.  This vivid tale with immense doses of imagination will like to fantasy fans and cinema classic buffs",
		"This film, was one of my childhood favorites and I must say that, unlike some other films I liked in that period The Thief of Bagdad has held on to it is quality while I grew up.  This is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children, it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well.  The only drawback there is, is that one can not see past the bad effects compared to the effects nowadays like one could when one was a child.  I remembered nothing Who then watches effects?  One only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides.  In my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century.  Coming to think of it I feel like the Indiana Jones films are quite a like this film.  There is comedy, romance and adventure all in one, which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern, it succeeds in not being dusty and old.  All of that is mainly due to the great story, the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors.  In that department Sabu as Abu and Conrad Veidt as Jaffar stand out, providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part.  Great film and although an oldie, definitely a goldie.  I hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on DVD someday.8 out of 10",

In that department Sabu as Abu and Conrad Veidt as Jaffar stand out, providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part.  Great film and although an oldie, definitely a goldie.  I hope someone",
		"Abu helps King Replete with swords  sorcery, it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines.  It also is a fine piece of film making, featuring good acting and an intelligent script.Conrad Veidt gets top billing and he deserves it, playing the evil magician Jaffar.  His saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during Silent days.  Here is a villain worth watching.  As the boyish Thief, Sabu is perfectly cast in this, his third film.  While not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in deed  action.The rest of the cast do fine work.  John Justin is both energetic  sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way; Sabu gets a significant part of the action when he is not transformed into a dog but Justin is appropriately athletic when needs must.  Lovely June Duprez plays the endangered Princess of Basra, coveted by two very different men.  Appearing late in the film, massive Rex Ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude.Allan Jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the Storyteller.  Miles Malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike Sultan of Basra, forever dithering on about his mechanical toys Malleson was also responsible for the films screen play  dialogue.  Aged Morton Selten portrays the benevolent King of Legend.  Mary Morris, later an exceptional stage actress, plays the dual roles of Jaffars accomplice and the sixarmed Silver Dancer.The film was begun in Britain, but wartime difficulties made Korda move it to Southern California, which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast.  The art direction, in vibrant Technicolor, is most attractive, especially the fairy tale architecture in blues, whites  pinks.Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu was employed in the Maharaja of Mysores stables when he was discovered by Kordas company and set before the cameras.  His first four films ELEPHANT BOY1937, THE DRUM1938, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD1940, JUNGLE BOOK1942 were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed.  After distinguished military service in World War II he resumed his film career, but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films, BLACK NARCISSUS 1947 being the one great exception.  His final movie, Walt Disneys A TIGER WALKS 1964 was an improvement, but it was too late.  Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years of age.",

		"The storyline of The Thief of Bagdad is complex, owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together.  The screenplay by Lajo Biros and the dialogue by Miles Malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points.The young King Ahmad of Bagdad is angry at his vizier Jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas.  He hate him He is imprisoned by Jaffar, where he meets Abu the young thief.  The two escape and take a boat to the city of Basra.  There the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the Princess of the city passing by.  Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden.  He tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss.  Then he is captured.  When Jaffar comes to win the Princess of Basra for himself, Ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns Abu into a dog.  Jaffar then asks for the Princesss hand, and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the Sultan of Basra.  The blind Ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace, accompanied by Abu as his dog.  The Prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her.  So Jaffar sends his servant Halima for Ahmad and the dog, in hopes the prince can rouse her.  He does awaken her.  She boards a ship to find a doctor to cure Ahmad, but she is captured by Jaffar who then throws the dog overboard.  She then allows Jaffar to take her in his arms, on his promise to restore Ahmads sight and turn Abu back into a thief.  The princess sees a vision of Ahmad; he is in a boat; Jaffar sends a storm to beset him and Abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island.  Abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle.  Abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel, then corks him in again.  For freeing him, he gets three wishes.  His first is for sausages.  In the meanwhile, the Princess pleads with her father to refuse Jaffar; but Jaffar shows the Sultan a new mechanical toy, one of whose six arms stabs him to death.  Abu makes a second wish, to find Ahmad.  The cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the AllSeeing eye.  Abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye, battling a giant spider, then scaling the goddesss statue.  Abu gazes into the eye and sees Ahmad in a canyon.  He has the genie take him to Ahmad.  Ahmad uses the eye to see the princess.  She smells a flower and forgets everything at once.  Abu wishes they were in Bagdad, but the genie laughs and leaves; Jaffar tells the Princess that she is in love with him, omitting mention of Ahmad.  Ahmad tries to fight his way to the Princess, but Jaffar smashes the eye.  Abu finds himself in the Land of Legend, where the old men who rule want to make him their king.  He steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead, to hurry to save Ahmad and the princess.  The thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner, using his bow from the flying carpet, to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution.  Jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse, but another shot from the bow finishes him.  Ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his Princess; but when he tries to make Abu his vizier, the young thief refuses, saying that what he wants is adventure, not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be.  This fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer Alexander Korda.  The production was designed by Vincent Korda who was also art director, while Georges Perinal did the colorful cinematography.  The directors credited are Ludwig Berger and Michael Powell, with Tim Whelan, Alexander Korda, William Cameron Menzies and Zoltan Korda participating.  The extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of John Armstrong, Oliver Messel and Marcel Vertes.  The production, apart from its gorgeous and expensivelooking visual splendors, I claim is dominated by two other elements, the choral music of Miklos Rozsa and the performance by Conrad Veidt as the evil Jaffar.  Rex Ingram plays the genie with a curious accent, plus his usual intelligence and power.  June Duprez is lovely and effective as the Princess Mary Morris is a sad and beautiful Halima, and Miles Malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious Sultan.  As Ahmad, John Justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some; he is memorably good in his winning role.  This film has a spaciousness about it that is found, I assert, in other Korda works also.  Its imaginative content stands in contrast to verystrong realistic sets, costumes and setdesign elements.  This is one of the most memorable idealevel fantasies of all time, worthy to be enjoyed over and over.",

		"The storyline of The Thief of Bagdad is complex, owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together.  The screenplay by Lajo Biros and the dialogue by Miles Malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points.The young King Ahmad of Bagdad is angry at his vizier Jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas.  He discovers while in disguise that people blame him for Jaffars deeds and hate him.  He is imprisoned by Jaffar, where he meets Abu the young thief.  The two escape and take a boat to the city of Basra.  There the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the Princess of the city passing by.  Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden.  He tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss.  Then he is captured.  When Jaffar comes to win the Princess of Basra for himself, Ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns Abu into a dog.  Jaffar then asks for the Princesss hand, and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the Sultan of Basra.  The blind Ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace, accompanied by Abu as his dog.  The Prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her.  So Jaffar sends his servant Halima for Ahmad and the dog, in hopes the prince can rouse her.  He does awaken her.  She boards a ship to find a doctor to cure Ahmad, but she is captured by Jaffar who then throws the dog overboard.  She then allows Jaffar to take her in his arms, on his promise to restore Ahmads sight and turn Abu back into a thief.  The princess sees a vision of Ahmad; he is in a boat; Jaffar sends a storm to beset him and Abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island.  Abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle.  Abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel, then corks him in again.  For freeing him, he gets three wishes.  His first is for sausages.  In the meanwhile, the Princess pleads with her father to refuse Jaffar; but Jaffar shows the Sultan a new mechanical toy, one of whose six arms stabs him to death.  Abu find Ahmad The cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the AllSeeing eye.  Abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye, battling a giant spider, then scaling the goddesss statue.  Abu gazes into the eye and sees Ahmad in a canyon.  He has the genie take him to Ahmad.  Ahmad uses the eye to see the princess.  She smells a flower and forgets everything at once.  Abu wishes they were in Bagdad, but the genie laughs and leaves; Jaffar tells the Princess that she is in love with him, omitting mention of Ahmad.  Ahmad tries to fight his way to the Princess, but Jaffar smashes the eye.  Abu finds himself in the Land of Legend, where the old men who rule want to make him their king.  He steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead, to hurry to save Ahmad and the princess.  The thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner, using his bow from the flying carpet, to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution.  Jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse, but another shot from the bow finishes him.  Ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his Princess; but when he tries to make Abu his vizier, the young thief refuses, saying that what he wants is adventure, not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be.  This fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer Alexander Korda.  The production was designed by Vincent Korda who was also art director, while Georges Perinal did the colorful cinematography.  The directors credited are Ludwig Berger and Michael Powell, with Tim Whelan, Alexander Korda, William Cameron Menzies and Zoltan Korda participating.

		"The storyline of The Thief of Bagdad is complex, owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together.  The screenplay by Lajo Biros and the dialogue by Miles Malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points.The young King Ahmad of Bagdad is angry at his vizier Jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas.  He discovers while in disguise that people blame him for Jaffars deeds and hate him.  He is imprisoned by Jaffar, where he meets Abu the young thief.  The two escape and take a boat to the city of Basra.  There the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the Princess of the city passing by.  Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden.  He tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss.  Then he is captured.  When Jaffar comes to win the Princess of Basra for himself, Ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns Abu into a dog.  Jaffar then asks for the Princesss hand, and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the Sultan of Basra.  The blind Ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace, accompanied by Abu as his dog.  The Prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her.  So Jaffar sends his servant Halima for Ahmad and the dog, in hopes the prince can rouse her.  He does awaken her.  She boards a ship to find a doctor to cure Ahmad, but she is captured by Jaffar who then throws the dog overboard.  She then allows Jaffar to take her in his arms, on his promise to restore Ahmads sight and turn Abu back into a thief.  The princess sees a vision of Ahmad; he is in a boat; Jaffar sends a storm to beset him and Abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island.  Abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle.  Abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel, then corks him in again.  For freeing him, he gets three wishes.  His first is for sausages.  In the meanwhile, the Princess pleads with her father to refuse Jaffar; but Jaffar shows the Sultan a new mechanical toy, one of whose six arms stabs him to death.  Abu makes a second wish, to find Ahmad.  The cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the AllSeeing eye.  Abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye, battling a giant spider, then scaling the goddesss statue.  Abu gazes into the eye and sees Ahmad in a canyon.  He has the genie take him to Ahmad.  Ahmad uses the eye to see the princess.  She smells a flower and forgets everything at once.  Abu wishes they were in Bagdad, but the genie laughs and leaves; Jaffar tells the Princess that she is in love with him, omitting mention of Ahmad.  Ahmad tries to fight his way to the Princess, but Jaffar smashes the eye.  Abu finds himself in the Land of Legend, where the old men who rule want to make him their king.  He save Ahmad The thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner, using his bow from the flying carpet, to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution.  Jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse, but another shot from the bow finishes him.  Ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his Princess; but when he tries to make Abu his vizier, the young thief refuses, saying that what he wants is adventure, not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be.  This fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer Alexander Korda.  The production was designed by Vincent Korda who was also art director, while Georges Perinal did the colorful cinematography.  The directors credited are Ludwig Berger and Michael Powell, with Tim Whelan, Alexander Korda, William Cameron Menzies and Zoltan Korda participating.

		"The movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful, but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of Baghdad. the jailed prince meets a thief called Abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called Basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with, but unbeknown to him the evil wizard Jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her.  Jafa makes him This leads to the prince and Abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat Jafa, restore peace to Baghdad and marry the princess. during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic Genies that takes Abu on a flight through the clouds, a giant spider that is really hungry, and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen.This is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses, genies, flying carpets, and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs.  It does not have any cheesy moments and the love story is not a waste of time.  The production designs are just stunning in this movie.  From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter.  Even though this movie is over 40 years old, the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in todays cinema.  The music and songs are also well done.  Anyone who sees it will no doubt hail, I want to be a sailor sailing on the seas as one of the great musical moments in movies.  I am usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since I find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but I will be more than happy to make an exception for this movie.What sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you do not see in everyday life which is also the same reason why I love stuff like Two Towers and Silent Hill.  Way before todays modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic CGI to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place.  One of my favorite shots in Two Towers is the one where we see the trolls opening the Black Gates, the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor, and that is what I love about the Genie and other creatures in the movie.  They are just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they are all just fantasy beings.It is literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of Aladdin got their inspiration.  The characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative Genie right down to the flying carpet.  It is not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it is nice to know that I am not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie.  I first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week I still think it is amazing.  That is a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time.  Sure, the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40s so give it a break.  Not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under todays standard.If you ever wanted to see a live action version of Aladdin then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this will not be their cup of tea.",

One of my favorite shots in Two Towers is the one where we see the trolls opening the Black Gates, the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor, and that is what I love about the Genie and other creatures in the movie.  They are just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they are all just fantasy beings.It is literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of Aladdin got their inspiration.  The characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative Genie right down to the flying carpet.  It is not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it is nice to know that I am not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie.  I thought it That is a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time.  Sure, the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40s so give it a break.  Not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under todays standard.If you ever wanted to see a live action version of Aladdin then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this will not be their cup of tea.",
		"Outstanding film of 1943 with Paul Lukas giving an Oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to America from Europe as the Nazi menace deepened.The usual terrific Bette Davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of 1943.Encounting treachery around them, Lukas successfully deals with the situation.  He knows he Resolute, she knows that her older son, must follow him on his path to liberty.A wonderful film highlighting American positive propaganda against a wicked foe.",

The music is by Miklos Rosza, who is cinema historys best.  Sabu is the Thief.  Conrad Veidt is the grand villain.  I have a copy within reach, for the next trip down memory lane.  Whoa there!

		"I discovered Alexander Both Korda Technicolor films, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown on one never to be forgotten program.  The music of Miklos Rozsa enhanced both films.  The Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful!  THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made.  As the years passed, it became more difficult to enjoy the films color in the way it had originally been presented in.  True Technicolor gave way to a Eastman Color process in the middle 1950s.  Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video.  But the Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original Technicolor.  The Laser Disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it  nice, but not as it should be.  NOW comes the MGM DVD 3 Dec 2002 issue.  THE THIEF OF BAGDAD again has the wonderful Technicolor look to it on a DVD that is nothing short of STUNNING!!!  It was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the DVD once, I watched it a second time.  The only Extras are a Spanish Dubbed version, SubTitles in both English  Spanish, and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer.  Thank you MGM for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD release.  Now, one can only hope that Kordas FOUR FEATHERS and a restored version of Kordas JUNGLE BOOK to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation will soon follow on DVD.",

Indeed, I dare to say that he performs some songs better than Caruso check AVuchella from Tosti and La Danza from Rossini.  The MGM art and music departments also did a good job.  This movie could be perfect, were it not for the awkward presence of Ann Blyth; we see that she is trying her best, dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before 1920  unforgivable.  Lanza demanding productions Also notice that Ms.  Kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with Lanza, giving the wrong notion that Caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano.",
		"Mario Lanza, of course, is The Great Caruso in this 1951 film also starring Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath.  This is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary, worldrenowned tenor whose name is known even today.The film is opulently produced, and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by Lanza, Kirsten, Judmila Novotna, Blanche Thebom, and other opera stars who appeared in the film.  If you are a purist, seeing people on stage smiling during the Sextet from Lucia will strike you as odd  even if Caruso as wife Dorothy just had a baby girl.  Also it is highly unlikely that Caruso ever sang Edgardo in Lucia; the role lay too high for him.In taking dramatic license, the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of Caruso as life.  What was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire, yet this is never mentioned in the film.  These roles include Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in Girl of the Golden West, There is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga.  The reason for that photo?  His only shirt was in the laundry.  He was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the Victor TalkingMachine Company later RCA Victor.  He has him He had a hemorrhage during LElisir damore at the Met and could not finish the performance; he only sang three more times at the Met, his last role as Eleazar in La Juive.

In fact, from his sound, had he wanted to, Caruso could have sung as a baritone.  He is thought to have had some trouble with high notes, further evidence of baritone leanings; and the role he was preparing when he died was Othello, a dramatic tenor role, which Lanza definitely was not.  Lanzas voice deserved not to be compared with another.  He made a unique contribution to film history, popularizing operatic music.  He sings the music in The Great Caruso with a robust energy; he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career.  His acting is natural and genuine.

		"Since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio, I doubt we will ever get a real life story of Enrico Caruso.  But if everything else was in place it was no accident that no Hollywood studio attempted the task until MetroGoldwynMayer had Mario Lanza under contract.  No one else could have done it, I doubt whether it will ever be tried again.And why should it.  I think Enrico For his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on the earth.  To say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest.  Caruso, like the man who portrayed him, was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline.  He had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film.  His contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought.  He is shown in a recording studio once late in his life.  Actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor made the recording industry what it became.When Caruso and McCormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live.  But a lot of immigrant Italian and Irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men.  It is why both became the legends that they are.What the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by Mario Lanza, a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a Caruso to stick to opera.  The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design.Mario himself helped popularize the film with an RCA Red Seal album of songs from The Great Caruso.  Unfortunately due to contractual obligations we could not get an actual cast album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, and Jarmila Novotna also.Though Blyth sang it in the film, Lanza had a big hit recording of The Loveliest Night of the Year further helping to popularize The Great Caruso.If you are looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, this as not it.

		"Since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio, I doubt we will ever get a real life story of Enrico Caruso.  But if everything else was in place it was no accident that no Hollywood studio attempted the task until MetroGoldwynMayer had Mario Lanza under contract.  No one else could have done it, I doubt whether it will ever be tried again.And why should it.  I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen.  For his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on the earth.  To say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest.  Caruso, like the man who portrayed him, was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline.  He had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film.  His contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought.  He is shown in a recording studio once late in his life.  Actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor made the recording industry what it became.When Caruso and McCormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live.  But a lot of immigrant Italian and Irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men.  It had he The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design.Mario himself helped popularize the film with an RCA Red Seal album of songs from The Great Caruso.  Unfortunately due to contractual obligations we could not get an actual cast album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, and Jarmila Novotna also.Though Blyth sang it in the film, Lanza had a big hit recording of The Loveliest Night of the Year further helping to popularize The Great Caruso.If you are looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, this as not it.

The characters in the firm did not really enjoy their real lives, but they did enjoy themselves, i.e. what they were.  The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory.  A good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life.  Many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those.  Before Sunrise dealt with it in a nice way, which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film.  Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head.  It just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities.  This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas.  You would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story.  The end was not quite important after all.

		"I saw it Having saw it twice, I could not help but missing Before Sunrise, not because the sequel was not as great, but I felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did, every time I finished watching one of them, I feel the need and yearning to see the other.  So, I ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly, I will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly.  The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other.  It sounds so simple, the growing of the chemistry, I think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development, but to me  who does not believe in Nora Ephron  Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it.  When I saw it for the first time, about 8 year ago when I was 20, I already liked it.  But, I did not rate it as a great film, it still seemed to me like another thinking persons feel good movie, Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic, it was 10 minutes too long, the characters was too well fabricated, I thought I liked it because it was like a dream and because I enjoyed their conversations, etc. etc..  But now, thanks to Before Sunset, I feel that is more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before.  I saw the elements more clearly Jesse, Celine, Vienna, their conversations, everything.  How each of them are separated element by itself, and they have a chance to mix, the story is just a frame of time, I am no longer feel manipulated.  And the freedom that every scene has, as well as its refusal to be overly efficient, how blind I was that those qualities did not strike me as exceptional when I first saw it!  Now, 8 year have passed, the more movies I have seen, the more I realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending, even movies like Pulp Fiction or Linklaterss own Slackers included.  The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that, maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case, but Before Sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time, not a destination, every single scene has its own life.  I do not know whether Linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made Before Sunrise, but to me, one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other.  Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes, seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine, the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it.  Meanwhile, I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset, and Celines first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile I have seen in a beginning of a film, and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place I do not know with a sadness in me, no matter how beautiful Paris is, and no matter how happy I am that they meet again.

If you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about loveydovey romance, do not waste your time and money.  On the other hand, if you are into dialog, masterful story telling, thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie.  I recommend you It is truly fantastic.  I really mean that.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but, thankfully, the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural, warm and tender.  They act and feel each other out from the very beginning, making you feel as an intruder.In their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner.  I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but I may be underestimating their intelligence.  Still it did not ruin the movie.The overall story is very simple which I think gives the movie it is charm and ultimately it is power.BOTTOM LINE The movies flow is slow.  The dialog is fascinating.  The story builds gently, systematically and substantive.  The build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding.",

I seen it I, on the other hand, felt completely the opposite.  I was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else.  People I talked to said there was too much talking!  Plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters.  I found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the American moviegoing public seems to have a tendency to want easytofollow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused.  They also like to be spoonfed tidy endingshappy OR sad.  This disgusts me.  Nobody wants to be challenged anymore???  And as for the ending and I do not want to be a spoiler, I am totally content because I know in my heart that these two characters WILL see each other again.

Richard Linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of Vienna.

It is very intimate.  Plus, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life.  They must have improvised during some parts and it works well.  They have a great chemistry in their roles.  Their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses.  I get the feeling that this was a very personal work for Mr.  Linklater and I deeply respect him for getting this film made.  It definitely touched me and I hope it touches others just as much.

		"Ever since I can remember and I am only 18 my mother and I have been and continue to watch older movies because well I find them much more rewarding in the long run but hey do not get me wrong I do love the movies we have today just not as much as I love movies of the 40s and 50s Anyways, now I have to say the moment I started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the TV.  Of course my favorite character was the Grandmother played by Lucile Watson.  But I loved the way Betty Davis and her family was portrayed.  The children...did not act like children in the slightest.  But there is good reason for that, having had to hid and run most of your life, seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence.  So people saying oooo i hated how the kids acted...blah blah blah read between the lines and know they saw things children should not see.Paul Lukas...dear Paul did an amazing job!!!  Now I know many people are mad that he go the Oscar and Bogie did not but hey they both did amazing jobs so I think it could have gone either way.  But Lukas performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie I was reduced to tears.  I recommend it D",
		"Before Sunrise has many remarkable things going on, almost too many to fit into one review like this, but it is suffice to say that it is one of the most observant character studies of the nineties, maybe even in all of contemporary cinema, to be observant not about love, persay, so much as it is about a human connection.  How does one fall in love at first sight?  No one does, at least that is deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film.  And yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time.  Linklater gives us Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the town, in Vienna, until his plane the next morning.Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine, in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance, and in a sense is about the act of having conversations, of what it is like to watch people having one leading into another and another.  Here it is often about relationships and commitments, as Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential, or seemingly so, and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities.  We hear confessions of desires for other loves, or what were not really loves, of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you will love your life, of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form, or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul I loved the bit about the quakers in the church, and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism.  Jessie may be more responsible for that last part, but what is fascinating about the film is that it is never exactly cynical itself, just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives.Meanwhile, it is always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in these roles, where they are not incessantly annoying in that 90s GenerationX mode, but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film, which is not a bad one at all but a necessary one, one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere.  The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter, only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other, where sweet asides are actually acceptable I have to tell you a secret, Jessie says, and then leans in for a kiss, hoho, or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way.  I loved the scene with the poet, where it is very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal, or with the palm reader and how the reactions from Jessie and Celine are that we might share, but really are seeing them do it firsthand.  All the while Hawke and Delpy embody the roles interestingly we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives as it may lead off into the future...Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness, however selfcontained, as it may lead into something more.  Who is to say you cannot suddenly be attached to someone, if only for less than 24 hours, and be that much more attached than a married couple?  This is perhaps Linklaters thesis, but there is more to it than just that.  It is a very dense film, and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly.  One scene especially, which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking on the phone in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the others friend.  A",

The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter, only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other, where sweet asides are actually acceptable I have to tell you a secret, Jessie says, and then leans in for a kiss, hoho, or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way.  I loved the scene with the poet, where it is very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal, or with the palm reader and how the reactions from Jessie and Celine are that we might share, but really are seeing them do it firsthand.  All the while Hawke and Delpy embody the roles interestingly we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives as it may lead off into the future...Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness, however selfcontained, as it may lead into something more.  Who is to say you cannot suddenly be attached to someone, if only for less than 24 hours, and be that much more attached than a married couple?  This is perhaps Linklaters thesis, but there is more to it than just that.  It is a very dense film, and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly.

		"Before Sunrise has many remarkable things going on, almost too many to fit into one review like this, but it is suffice to say that it is one of the most observant character studies of the nineties, maybe even in all of contemporary cinema, to be observant not about love, persay, so much as it is about a human connection.  How does one fall in love at first sight?  No one does, at least that is deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film.  And yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time.  Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie, a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna, and on the way there start to talking about things, at first arbitrary, then personal Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather.  Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the town, in Vienna, until his plane the next morning.Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine, in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance, and in a sense is about the act of having conversations, of what it is like to watch people having one leading into another and another.

		"This is truly truly one of the best movies about love that I have ever seen.  Closely followed by none other than Before Sunset, which technically is not another movie at all, since it is about the same two people and the same romance.This is love in the real world.  OK, that is only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie.  Reading the other reviews, it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialogbased movies as well.  And this is what makes Before Sunrise so good.  The dialog is perfect.  It is so real, so engaging and funny.  It phone their It is PERFECT.  Brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life.I must say that if you have a choice, do watch Before Sunrise before watching Before Sunset.  If like me, you watched Sunset first, it is hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show.Once again, the greatest romantic movie in my books.  Wonderful acting, excellent script, and beautiful locations.  Young love, at it is best.",
		"First let me say that Before Sunrise, like all movies, is NOT a movie for all tastes.  It appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact, but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people.  For me, like most folks here, Before Sunrise struck a deep chord in me, I was truly stunned, moved, inspired by it.  This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing.  It creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine.  It is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings I got from it.The movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other.  It articulate responses It captures an honest, romantic, yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime Viennese milieu; it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world.  And what happens after that night is open for debate, but I never doubt that they will not each other again.The facile comments by RockytheBear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie.See it and it may change your way of life.",

		"Many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with The Mortal Storm or Casablanca.  Everyone chose Paul It does not strike me as totally wrong.  Lukas had a good career in film both here and in England  he is the villain in The Lady Vanishes, and this performance was his best one.  Bogart had more great performances in him than Rick Blaine for instance, he was ignored for Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Roy Earle in High Sierra two years earlier, both of which were first rate performances, and he would not get an Oscar for his greatest performances as Fred C.  Dobbs in The Treasure Of Sierra Madres, the writermurder suspect in In A Lonely Place, and Captain Philip Francis Queeg in The Caine Mutiny afterward  he got it for Charley in The African Queen.  I think that Bogie should have got it for the role of Dobbs, but it did not happen.  But Lukas was lucky  he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career.  Few can claim that.To me the film to look at with Watch On The Rhine is based on another playscript by Hellman, The Searching Wind.  They both look at Americas spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s.  The Searching Wind is really looking at the whole interwar period, while Watch On The Rhine, set in the years just proceeding our entry into World War II, deals with a few weeks of time.  Therefore it is better constructed as a play, and more meaningful for it is impact.  The film has many good performances, led by Lukas as the exhausted but determined antiNazi fightercourier, Davis as his loyal wife wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to Lukas being the center of the plays activities, Coulouris as the selfish, conniving, but ultimately foolish and ineffective Teck, Lucille Watson as the mother of Davis and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Coulouris wiser and sadder and fed up wife, and Kurt Katch, who delivers a devastating critique as the local embassys Gestapo chief about Coulouris and others who would deal with the Nazis.  It has dialog with bite in it.  And what it says is quite true.  It also has moments of near poetry.  Witness the scene, towards the end, when Coulouris is left alone with Lukas and Davis, and says, The New World has left the scene to the Old World.  Hellman could write very well at times.Given the strength of the film script and performances I would rate this film highly among World War II films.",

I think that Bogie should have got it for the role of Dobbs, but it did not happen.  But Lukas was lucky  he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career.  Few can claim that.To me the film to look at with Watch On The Rhine is based on another playscript by Hellman, The Searching Wind.  They both look at Americas spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s.  The Searching Wind is really looking at the whole interwar period, while Watch On The Rhine, set in the years just proceeding our entry into World War II, deals with a few weeks of time.  Therefore it is better constructed as a play, and more meaningful for it is impact.  The film has many good performances, led by Lukas as the exhausted but determined antiNazi fightercourier, Davis as his loyal wife wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to Lukas being the center of the plays activities, Coulouris as the selfish, conniving, but ultimately foolish and ineffective Teck, Lucille Watson as the mother of Davis and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Coulouris wiser and sadder and fed up wife, and Kurt Katch, who delivers a devastating critique as the local embassys Gestapo chief about Coulouris and others who would deal with the Nazis.  It has dialog with bite in it.  And what it says is quite true.  It also has moments of near poetry.  Witness the scene, towards the end, when Coulouris is left alone with Lukas and Davis, and says, The New World has left the scene to the Old World.  Hellman could write very well at times.Given the strength of the film script and performances I would rate this film highly among World War II films.",
		"Many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with The Mortal Storm or Casablanca.  Everyone is entitled to compare films they choose, but the similarities of The Mortal Storm and Watch On The Rhine are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the Nazi juggernaut, while the main comparative point brought out with Casablanca is the seeming unjust treatment of Humphrey Bogart in 1943 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science, because they chose Paul Lukas instead for the Best Actor Oscar.  It does not strike me as totally wrong.  Lukas had a good career in film both here and in England  he is the villain in The Lady Vanishes, and this performance was his best one.  Bogart had more great performances in him than Rick Blaine for instance, he was ignored for Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Roy Earle in High Sierra two years earlier, both of which were first rate performances, and he would not get an Oscar for his greatest performances as Fred C.
