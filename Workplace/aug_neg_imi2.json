		"Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig.  Starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy.  A formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane, violent mob by the crazy chantings of it is singers.  Unfortunately it stays absurd the WHOLE time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting.  Even those from the era should be turned off.  Shakespeare seem third grader On a technical level it is better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond.  Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.",

While I would like to see this extra footage I am not sure I could sit through a near three hour cut of Airport 77.  As expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions  interior design choices, I will say no more other than the toy plane model effects are not great either.  Along with the other two Airport sequels this takes pride of place in the Razzie Awards Hall of Shame although I can think of lots of worse films than this so I reckon that is a little harsh.  The action scenes are a little dull unfortunately, the pace is slow  not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as I reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly.The production values are alright if nothing spectacular.  The acting is not great, two time Oscar winner Jack Lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this, one time Oscar winner James Stewart looks old  frail, also one time Oscar winner Lee Grant looks drunk while Sir Christopher Lee is given little to do  there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too.Airport 77 is the most disaster orientated of the three Airport films so far  I liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly, the production  bland direction does not help though  a film about a sunken plane just should not be this boring or lethargic.

		"This film lacked something I could not put my finger on at first charisma on the part of the leading actress.  she shared leading man Even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play.  It could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors.  I just do not know.But could it have been the screenplay?  Just exactly who was the chef in love with?  He seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant, and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits, than of anybody or anything else.  He never convinced me he was in love with the princess.I was disappointed in this movie.  But, do not forget it was nominated for an Oscar, so judge for yourself.",

		"When I was little my parents took me along to the theater to see Interiors.  It was many movies It was many movies Since then I had never seen Interiors until just recently, and I could have lived out the rest of my life without it.  What a pretentious, ponderous, and painfully boring piece of 70s wine and cheese tripe.  Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors but Interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career.  In the unmistakable style of Ingmar Berman, Allen gives us a dark, angular, muted, insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce, estrangement, career, love, nonlove, halitosis, whatever.  The film, intentionally, has no comic relief, no music, and is drenched in shadowy pathos.  This film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature, using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a more pronounced depth of meaning and truth.  But Woody Allen is no Ingmar Bergman.  The film is painfully slow and dull.  But beyond that, I simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters.  Instead I felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling, whining, nicotine stained, martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity.  Amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked Brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room.  Everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes.  Everyone is lost and struggling, desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them.  It is never about resolution, it is only about interminable introspective babble.  It is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audiences ability to connect.  Woody Allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out.  And for that reason I found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining.  I see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through Prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance.  I highly recommend this one if you are feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death.  Otherwise, let us just pretend this film never happened.",

		"It appears many critics And for good reason they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of Bergman.  And let us not kid ourselves critics were mostly supportive of Allens Bergman pretensions, Allens whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding.  What I do not get is this why was Allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating Bergman, but the contemporaneous Brian DePalma was excoriated for ripping off Hitchcock in his suspensehorror films?  In Robin Woods view, it is a strange form of cultural snobbery.  I would have to agree with that.",
		"The second attempt by a New York intellectual in less than 10 years to make a Swedish film  the first being Susan Sontags Brother Carl which was made in Sweden, with Swedish actors, no less!  The results?  Oscar Wilde said it best, in reference to Dickens The Old Curiosity Shop One would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of Little Nell.  Pretty much the same thing here.  Interiors is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers.  I am afraid of my anger.  Looking into the middle distance I do not like who I am becoming.  The directorial quotations to use a polite term from Bergman are close to parody.  The incredibly selfinvolved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of strangulation.  I read other day It was in  I do not know  The New Yorker.  Oh.  That was an old poem.  I reworked it.  Far from not caring about these people, however, I found them quite hilarious.  Much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from Allens earlier films  only he is directed his actors to play the lines straight.  Having not cast himself in the movie, he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copy all of his thespian tics, intonations, and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing surrogate much like Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity.The basic plot  dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother  seems to be lifted more or less from Bergmans Winter Light, the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst.  It all comes through in the shopworn visualaural tricks the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach. etc, etc.Allens later serious films are less embarrassing, but also far less entertaining.  I will take Interiors.  Woodys rarely made a funnier movie.",

Much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from Allens earlier films  only he is directed his actors to play the lines straight.  he has poor Mary It all comes through in the shopworn visualaural tricks the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach. etc, etc.Allens later serious films are less embarrassing, but also far less entertaining.  I will take Interiors.  Woodys rarely made a funnier movie.",
		"I do clueless director It seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon that there was not enough left to really make a movie.  This could have been very entertaining, but there was a veil of timidity, even cowardice, that hung over each scene.  Since it got an R rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70yearold woman and not Angie Harmon?  Why does Sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships WITH TWO OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY ACTRESSES in the world?  If they were only looking for laughs why not cast Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead?  This was so predictable I was surprised to find that the director was not a five year old.  What a waste, not just for the viewers but for the actors as well.",
		"The film is bad.  There is no other way to say it.  The story is weak and outdated, especially for this country.  I do not think most people know what a walker is or will really care.  I felt as if I was watching a movie from the 70s.  The subject was just not believable for the year 2007, even being set in DC.  I think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end.  Most did not stay for the QA either.I do not think Schrader really thought the film out ahead of time.  Many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just did not know how to finish them.  He jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on.  I really did not get Woodys Carter private life or boyfriend either.  What were all the artistic male bondage and torture pictures from Iraq prisons about?  What was he thinking?  it was Woodys character I think Woodys character It did not work.  It did not even seem to make sense really.The only good thing about this film was Woody Harrelson.  He played his character Car flawlessly.  You really did get a great sense of what a walker may have been like say twenty years ago.  He was great and most likely will never get recognized for it.  As for Lauren, Lily and Kristin...  Boring.Do not see it!  It is painful!  Unless you are a true Harrelson fan.",

		"This film is one giant pant load.  Paul Schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay.  And his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process.  The worst though is Woody Harrelson, whom I ordinarily like when he is properly cast.  He plays social companion He could not have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick.  His southern accent is that off the rack version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers, as though the heat and humidity of the South is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has.  It is monotonous.  But, his is not the worst accent in the movie.  His boyfriend, played by Moritz Bleibtreau, attempts to affect some kind of a Mid East accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him.  He is incapable of rolling his rs in spite of the fact that in real life he is German, and speaks several languages  one of them being Italian!  That is kind of a good reason to cast someone else do not ya think?  From the story, to the screenplay, to the directing, to the camera work, to the performances by the leads, this movie is bad from beginning to end.  The only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall, and Kristin Scott Thomas.  Only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact.  In fact, all three are excellent, in spite of being trapped in a really bad film.  Ufortunately, no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws.  If you like these three actresses, watch them in something else.  This movie is not worth your time.",

		"The plot for Descent, if it actually can be called a plot, has two noteworthy events.  One near the beginning  one at the end.  Together these events make up maybe 5 of the total movie time.  Everything and I mean _everything_ in between is basically the directors desperate effort to fill in the minutes.  I like disturbing movies I like dark movies I do gritty scenes I do gritty scenes I like disturbing movies Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here.  And no, she does not get naked, not even in the NC17 version, which I saw.If you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch Descent, take a nap instead  you will probably have more interesting dreams.",
		"it hints related topics Plot is worth discussion Characters are interesting though sometimes.  Not realistic but interesting nevertheless.Development is slow like tea drinking ceremony.  Visuals not stunning, but good enough to ease the eye strain.  Good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed  nothing shocking too much, nothing overexciting.  Movie sitcom style.I liked Woody  excellent performance.  Had to fight the plot inadequacy and did the job pretty good.  The rest are bearable though very predictable.  The whole is watchable and better than most TV shows.",
		"This film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful mens wives.I thought The Walker would be thrilling and engaging, but I was so wrong.  The pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow, that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing happens much.  Seriously, the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes.  That is how slow it is.The fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom.  It is almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion.  Maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class?  It is strong cast Blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing.",
		"This movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years.  Not even woody Harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom.The murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not, nothing is of any interest.  The cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful , I just sat in utter amazement during this movie, thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining The producers of this movie were very clever.  They made good actors People will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think, Woody Harrison ,Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe this must be good and rent this movie.boy are they in for a horrible timeIf you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie, some people actually did enjoyed this movie but I like to watch a movie with meaning",
		"I saw this movie at a drivein in 1959.  Until Howard the Duck I considered this the worst movie I had ever seen.  This movie tried to combine all the genera in one; comedy, horror, teenage angst, and the hot rod that must have sired My Mother, The Car.  it is accurate reflection",

		"I rented this on DVD and I kind of feel bad since Dawson and Lugacy are so earnest about it in the DVD comments.  It is bad movie it is human nature It is human nature Plus, it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways, and the characters behavior often strains belief.  I would say its a film that you would get something out of if you do not have a lot of filmTVliteraturelife behind you to be honest, I have seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even.  Otherwise, its point has been made before and more artfully.  And that gets to the big problem, which is that it really does not have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point.  It ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling, and it does not really pay off.",

		"Summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what is the hottest movie of the week, given 99.9 of the screens dedicated to screening it.  OK, so I may exaggerate on the percentage, but you get my drift.  Besides stuff from Hollywood, Bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters, and from some of the trailers shown, I am hyped to watch them too.  I was low turnout Tashan was low turnout When I watched Jodha Akbar, it was a full house, but it was not for Tashan.After watching it, I knew why.  It was entertaining, but it was fundamentally weak.  Just like it is literal English title, which means Style, Tashan is all style, but little substance.  Not that it does not have the usual star power, but scenes felt forced, and some bordered on a tad ridiculous, even for Bollywood standards I must say.  Which is quite surprising given that Tashan is directed and written by Vijay Krishna Acharya, who wrote Dhoom and Dhoom 2, both of which I enjoyed tremendously.  In his rookie directorial outing with Tashan, while you cannot fault his direction, you would probably scratch your head over the plot, which was clunky at best.  It tried to force too many things into the story, though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation, but that came a little too late, and only toward the finale, which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a Thai action movie, with Hong Kongs wirework and Hollywoods ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil.  And in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink, you have an assortment of vehicles appearing, and the one that took the cake, in a Dhoom 2 homage, was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere.At best, Tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy, and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters.  Saif Ali Khan plays Jimmy Cliff, a call center executive who gives English tuition, only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material.  His playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with Pooja Singh Kareena Kapoor, who is not exactly who she seems, the meek and sweet natured hottie.  She engages Jimmys services for her boss, mobster Bhaiyyaji Anil Kapoor, who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken English and phrases must like how an ahbeng does it.  And to complete the quartet, Akshay Kumar plays Bachchan Pandey, an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by Bhaiyyaji to hunt down Jimmy and Pooja when they escape with money stolen from Bahiyyajis business.So begins a road trip of sorts, with friends who turned enemies, and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on.  Jimmy Cliff is probably the most implausible of all, because he goes from zero to hero, executing moves that would shame Rambo, in absolutely no time, which is quite out of character.  Kareena Kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men, and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes, and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee.  Every character has a backstory created, and I thought Akshay Kumars Bachchan Pandey was probably the best, the most touching and the most fun of the lot, even though his character seemed a lot like a nongreen Incredible Hulk with his gravitydefying leaps and power packing punches.  His wounds also heal automatically, which impressively puts Wolverine to shame.  And the best part is his theme song, which is damn alphamale and played in rara mode each time he takes on adversaries.But sad to say, that is the only tune that is memorable, something that cheers Bachchan PandeyBachchanPandey.  For most Bollywood movies I watch, I will usually be able to, despite the obvious language gaps, emerge from screenings humming a tune or two.  I was not able to do that after Tashan, because the songs unfortunately just were not catchy at all.  Usually the songdance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location.  That I enjoy, versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain, or atop jagged rocks on the beach front.Tashan probably did not take itself too seriously, but coming from Vijay Krishna Acharyas story, you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous, and for continuity to be a little more careful as well.  Billed as a blockbuster, now I can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one.  Despite Akshay Kumr stealing the show, Tashan could have been better on the whole.",

Not that it does not have the usual star power, but scenes felt forced, and some bordered on a tad ridiculous, even for Bollywood standards I must say.

Saif Ali Khan plays Jimmy Cliff, a call center executive who gives English tuition, only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material.  His playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with Pooja Singh Kareena Kapoor, who is not exactly who she seems, the meek and sweet natured hottie.  She engages Jimmys services for her boss, mobster Bhaiyyaji Anil Kapoor, who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken English and phrases must like how an ahbeng does it.  And to complete the quartet, Akshay Kumar plays Bachchan Pandey, an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by Bhaiyyaji to hunt down Jimmy and Pooja when they escape with money stolen from Bahiyyajis business.So begins a road trip of sorts, with friends who turned enemies, and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on.  Jimmy Cliff is probably the most implausible of all, because he goes from zero to hero, executing moves that would shame Rambo, in absolutely no time, which is quite out of character.  Kareena Kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men, and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes, and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee.  Every character has a backstory created, and I thought Akshay Kumars Bachchan Pandey was probably the best, the most touching and the most fun of the lot, even though his character seemed a lot like a nongreen Incredible Hulk with his gravitydefying leaps and power packing punches.

But this setup is not utilized to properly.  There could have been a better mix and match of their narrations.  Actions sequences are from the seventies.Cheoreography of the film is awful.  I think Vaibhavi Merchant just sleep walked through this film.  VishalShekhar have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film.  Why is there a sufi song Dil Haara in Tashan?  Why is the cool Hinglish song Dil Dance Maare not on Anil Kapoor when he is the one who is English crazy?  Akshay Kumar is the saving grace of the film.  But he is in his stereotyped self.

		"it is enormous star The film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and Akshay Kumar.  He has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations.The first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film.  That itself was a clear indicator of the directors vision.  Every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted.  Anil Kapoors gimmick of attempting good English falls flat most of the times.  And Saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie.In short It is THE BIGGEST WASTE OF RESOURSES AFTER JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM.  I would say that even Aaja Nachle was a better enjoyable movie than this.One cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved.  The most unwanted was the flashback sequence of Akshays love story.  After the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music.  Vishal Shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song.  The songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically.  Only one song Falak Tak Chal is somehow good of all in the lot.  An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar.Regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this  Akshay and Saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign Location probably Ladakh.  In the next scene they are searching for Kareena in Haridwar and then back in the hills with Kareena in the dicky of their car.  I am still thinking who wrote this.If you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts.  You can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are GOD.  Are we still seeing a 2008 movie with all these technical heights achieved?  So no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan.Dear Anil Kapoor  Akshay Kumar, If possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out.  As artists of such stature, you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers.  People still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively.  I think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie, the actors and the production house both.",

		"it had nice star I had nice star I had nice star Well, I was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I would say Dhoom 2 is very realistic.  When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt nice because it was put up in a nice way.  Well, the very first scene itself pised me off.  Then, the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences.  Me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights.  It was like Akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns!  Phew...you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are.The other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story.  It reminded me of some of the early 80s movies.Well, the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy Kareena, who looked really hot in this one.And for that, I give a rating of 2 out of 10.Guys, please..please...do not see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie.  Well, you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes.Thats all.",

		"it was call centre I had call centre The two fall in love and decide to run away but Pooja tells Jimmy that she cannot do this as she owes a debt to Lakhan Singh, who is also known as Bhaiyyaji.  But they decide and steal money from him and its only then that Jimmy finds out that Bhaiyyaji  Lakhan Singh is a Don.  In the meantime, Bhaiyyaji hires a man, Bachchan Pandey, to track down Jimmy and Pooja.Starring Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, the movie is directed by first time director Viay Krishna Acharya and is produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra.Tashan has to be one of the worse films that I have ever watched.  Yes!  The scenery is good and Kareena Kapoor and her much publicised weight loss looks good.  But plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other  hence why I have said at the beginning that I had expected more from this film as it was a Yashraj Production.  With reference to songs, unfortunately, there is not one song that I can remember now.There are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saif could have definitely done better while Kareena Kapoor played her part well.  But this cannot be said for Anil Kapoor  it did not suit him at all as a villain.  Lastly,never mind Aditya Chopra, who in the past has produced and directed good films such as Mohabbatein, what was Yash Chopra doing by producing such a trash movie?  Conclusion Bad movie, not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression.",
		"I had no idea what the film is about before I saw it because Tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted.  It is directorial debut It is directorial debut they said directorial debut their was proper trailer I understood proper trailer The story was extremely dum and even a 10 year old child can come up with a better storyline.  There was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it is difficult to figure out that who is killing who.  Also the action was daft  unrealistic e.g. 1 man with a handgun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns.While I was watching Tashan it reminded me of 3 filmsSin City During the opening credits.Koyla Anil Kapoors terrible English like Amrish Puri in Koyla.Jhoom Barabar Jhoom The outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny.I also heard the budget is 40 crores which is the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I do not know where all the money went to.  Anyway if you did not like Dhoom 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will like Tashan.  Race was hot on heels and that is a million times better.The only 2 good songs are Dil Haara  Challiya and both songs are shot in Greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film?  Even Anil Kapoors terrible English could not save this discomfiture.",

The humor was completely lost on the audience, and yes  Ghost in the Shell fans, this is NOT an action scifi or anything like that  its an attempt at slapstick comedy, and the humor just did not work after being translated.  It was a total chore to watch this movie, and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest, especially considering how excited I was and how open I was for anything  I was not expecting a Ghost in the Shell sequel, but I was expecting something entertaining, and it simply did not achieve this.  Yaaawwnnn...  Rent Kinos Journey instead.",

		"Tashan  the title itself explains the nature of the movie.This type of movies are actually made for flop.  What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces such movies those are worthless than Cgrade movies.  Or even some Cgrade movies have better and pleasing story than Tashan.  The much hyped and overconfidently promoted Tashan poorly bombed at the boxoffice which it certainly deserved.In my view, this is the worst movie ever made from honourable Yash Raj Films banner.  they handled new Vijay He tried to imitate Sanjay Gadhvis ways of making like Dhoom but he suffered at last.  The action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences.The story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences hearts.  In most scenes Anil Kapoor reminds me of southern Tamil star Rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions.  I am not a fan of neither Saif nor Akshay, but the award of Kareena should have finally gone to Saifs hand instead of Akshay.  Just from the starting point I expected of it, but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth.  Saif is the main behind the whole adventure, while Akshay joins in the midst.  In any movie, the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit.  And Tashan loses in this way, and unexpectedly failed to become a hit.Akshays has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies.  He seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again.  In between Saif did a great job in Race, and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie.  But he has fully developed himself in the acting field.  And last but not the least about Kareena.  She looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean.  But I myself do not think so, instead she became slim.  Yes slim!!!  it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people or say, male.  Beside them it is nice that Saifs son Ibrahim appears in the beginning  last as young Saif.  I hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career.Those who like this Tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood, or say want to be admitted in an asylum.  Thumbs down to debutante director Vijay Krishna Acharya who mishandled the project offered by Yash Raj Films.  In future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 years before going into practical directions.Sorry, I do not like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies.",

		"I just saw the movie in theater.  The movie has very few good points to talk about.  Kareenas beauty and a couple of songs may be.  Thats it.  The movie is a complete disappointment in all areas.  Anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed, even Mumbai Indians too just now Chennai has made it to semifinal.  But the worst I feel about the movie is the action scenes.  Now days Bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from Hollywood.  But they forget that Hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real.  But unfortunately Bollywood directors do not have that much of time.  They spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie.  Now such too stupid action scenes may work in South as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people.  But in Bollywood this is certainly not going to work.  All the action scenes I wish I could have forwarded.  At the end even some Chinese people appear from nowhere to beat Akshay Kumar.  This is height of stupidity.  Audience is such stupidity I think Bollywood now should forget about the action movies.  They cant make it.  The last good action I have seen was from Ghatak and Khiladiyon ka Khialdi.  The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me.  Does these people see their movie after completion?  Cannot they figure out that the slow motion action which is done using ropes is too unrealistic and childish?  Better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it.  I just want to go back to Amitabhs era where movie like Zanjeer and Deewar were having thrilling action scenes.  The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but visually it is much better than current era scenes.  This movie now should open the eyes of the Bollywood movie directors.  Please do not make any more action movies, until you acquire the art of making it realistic.",
		"The storyline was okay.  Akshay Kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie.  Kareena Kapoor looked bad.  There was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner.  I do bad role There was nothing much to do for him in the movie.  Just because it is a Yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is.  Said Ali khan was alright.  I think that it is high time that Indian directors and producers start thinking of Indian customers as intelligent lot.  What are we ?  fools!!!!  What do they think, they will show 2 men taking on a SWAT squad to teeters and we will believe them.  Is the Indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals.... they take an entire squad of 100  policemen and no one was there to surround the palace.  The action was crap and I have never seen such bad action.  Akshay Kumar was between a circle of 3040 policemen all shooting at him..... and he shooting back at them.  None of the policemens bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen.  Crap.  CRAP.I think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement.I strongly recommend NOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE.",

		"The storyline was okay.  Akshay Kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie.  Kareena Kapoor looked bad.  There was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner.  I do not know why the hell did Anil Kapoor accepted such a bad role.  There was nothing much to do for him in the movie.  Just because it is a Yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is.  Said Ali khan was alright.  I think that it is high time that Indian directors and producers start thinking of Indian customers as intelligent lot.  What are we ?  fools!!!!  What do they think, they will show 2 men taking on a SWAT squad to teeters and we will believe them.  Is the Indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals.... they take an entire squad of 100  policemen and no one was there to surround the palace.  I have bad action Akshay Kumar was between a circle of 3040 policemen all shooting at him..... and he shooting back at them.  None of the policemens bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen.  Crap.  CRAP.I think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement.I strongly recommend NOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE.",
		"he is weird film What kinda role it is?  What acting is he doing?  His first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts Then came Akshay who provided some nice scenes, but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff Childhood romance, overdose of childish Rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes The ending is another jokeVijay Krishna Acharya would have got 3 films more to direct, if this film had worked, thats the strategy of yashraj, only money nothing else So Vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers Music Vishal Shekhar is ordinaryPerformances Akshay Kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air, he actually provides some engaging moments Saif Ali Khan is irritating, Kareena is equally bad Anil Kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more Rest are okay",
		"If there is one film which is the worst of this year it is TASHAN The first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring Dhoom 2 style film, and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe Because of it being a Yashraj film Or maybe seeing the cheesy promo But this film gave me a shock, it was even worst then Dhoom 2 and what i expected First Saifs introduction which is boring Then Saif Kareena meet, Kareena is so artificial and then Anil Kapoor oh god, what he is doing in such a weird film?  What kinda role it is?  What acting is he doing?  he overacts nice scenes Kareena is bad Anil he overacts bad Anil",
		"Absolutely awful movie.  Utter waste of time.background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech.  they speak unintelligible.Camera work Hell you can slim down but you cannot gain grace.After spending three hours watching a movie I want to like it, but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure.  Please if you want to torture yourself, go ahead watch this.",
		"I had never thought the standard of Yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent!  The film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interest.Saif has over acted.  Kareena has good actress Akshay is good.  Anil is also good.  May I say the role was not good..Great deal of cheapness is filled in.  Wondered if that was supposed to be the comedy part of the movie.  Just because last few movies were flops does that mean Yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish?  It has a history of so many good films.  Overall, I was totally disappointed with the movie.",

		"This movie is horrible.  THe acting is a waste basket.  No crying, no action, hopeless songs.  Though the scenery is great.  I have great performance He was sensational in this movie.  For only this performance, Filmfare should introduce another award.  The toiletries award for the worst performance.  By the way the trophy should be a toilet seat.Kareena Kapoor.  She first of all is not comparable to her sister Karisma.  In acting, in looks, or in body.  She now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her.  She comes into this movie wearing bikinis and tank tops and short shorts.  I really wonder why Saif Ali Khan is letting his wifetobe dress like that.  But, she must have impressed some people dressing like that.  And if you ask how, then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie.  They are dreaming of having Kareena Kapoor in bed naked with a condom.  Including me.  Personally I think that she dressed like a whore, but I really liked it.I am forced to give it a 110, but I would really give this movie a 010.  An unachieved film.",

I do Japanese pop Other than that, I am Spanish, I eat paella and I like black humor.Good, with that point set, I can comment on the movie I have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the Japanese audiences, Mamoru Oshii is quite a good director despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of Talking Head, and even that was curious and somehow interesting and I am surprised he came up with this.  It may just be one of those lostintranslation cases, I am afraid it is, but as a European viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded English subtitles I just thought it was horrible.

The idea is great, and it is well exploited in those animated scenes.  However, the eyecandy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbojumbo speech over still pictures.  It just makes you want to fast forward to the next cutout hysterical characters scene.I read Mamoru Oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this.  The idea was good but horribly exploited.  Maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie, or maybe it will be more and more overnarrated scenes.  But hell, if you thought Talking Head was dense, Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters will give cause you a stroke.Of course, all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is European.

		"The sight of Kareena Kapoor in a twopiece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching Tashan  the megadisappointing, mindnumbing new film at the cinemas this weekend.  Tashan is bad film we see bad film Terrible because it takes its audience for granted, terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they have got big movie stars onboard.Written and directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya, Tashan is what you would describe as a road movie, but one that is going in all the wrong directions.  Saif Ali Khan stars as Jimmy Cliff, a callcentre executive who is hired to teach English to Bhaiyyaji  that is Anil Kapoor playing an ambitious UP gangster, desperate to go cool.  Jimmys got his eye on Pooja, the gangsters pretty young assistant played by Kareena Kapoor, who uses Jimmy to swindle her boss of 25 crore rupees.  Determined to recover his money and also to punish both Jimmy and Pooja, Bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job.  So you have Akshay Kumar as Bachchan Pandey, the gangsters faithful aide from Kanpur, who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that is hidden across the length and breadth of the country.Much like those bad eighties potboilers, Tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot.  But the treatments so overthetop, so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect.  Instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional threeact structure, you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed.  That garish item song in the desert, the bulletdodging action scene at a Rajasthani fort, Kareeenas bikini moment, even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks, a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala, and believe it or not, even a Dhannostyle horsedriven tonga.  In all fairness, not all these set pieces are badly done  the item song in the desert is quite neat actually  but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture, because you are just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really.  Little do you expect in a seemingly fastpaced road movie, to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts.You see the problem with Tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making.  What is more, I do not think they cared either  the film reeks of arrogance.  Arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work, Tashan is like an overcooked stew.There are films that kill you softly, and then there is Tashan, a film that kills you with excess.  Packaged snazzily with glossyfinish camerawork, exotic locations and fancy costumes, every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together, but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story does not hold.  Borrowing narrative from Tarantino and style from Stephen Chow does not help either because they do not blend with the films waferthin plot.  One may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging, but Anil Kapoors grating Hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists, and Saif Ali Khan fumbles through the film foolishly, unable to find his feet.  Kareena Kapoor, meanwhile, queen of overthetop delivery, does a decent job.  But of course, if Tashan is salvaged to some extent, it is thanks to Akshay Kumars irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character.  You cringe when he is cupping his crotch repeatedly, and you scowl when he delivers those doublemeaning dialogues, but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he is up there.Despite some good music from VishalShekhar, the songs seem like they are only prolonging your misery.  Well that is because Tashan is a test of your patience.  In case you did not know, Tashan means style.  I am sorry to say, this film has none.",

		"Such a long awaited movie..  But it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day..  it turned bad comedy But one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors, they have done their part of the movie very well.  Good acting, but i do not think that can save the movie..  India has been shot beautifully.  Kerala, Rajasthan, Ladakh?  were all saturated with color, alright.  Nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there ;Action sequences were shot very shabbily, no one could make out head  tail of the stunts, they have used Akkiakshay kumar very well but could have been done much much better..Animation is the worst i have seen in recent movies90s movies had better animation scenes i guessinitial scene where the car is falling off flying should be better word the road into lake.And the movies name has been mentioned nearly every 20 to 30 mins, just to make sure audiences do not forget the movie name i guess..",
		"I would have liked to write about the story, but there was not any.  I would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but hinglish is only funny for like 5 minutes, after that its overkill.  I would have liked to swoon over the keepuguessing suspense but it was as predictable as... um mm, a Yash raj movie ?.  I would have liked to talk of the edgeoftheseat action, but I do not like cartoons much. sighAll in all, this movie is perfect for 1. people attempting suicide  I promise it will push you over the edge 2.  Sadomasochists this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that Silas guy in the DaVinci code wore. 3.  People researching alternative ways Movie Piraters More power to them.  If any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch  this is it. 5.Barnacles, most types of plankton  green algae  Because almost all other living things would require an IQ factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers.  Afterthought The director of the movie, obviously, is a species of his own.   And i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind..one is enoughThings that could have made this a better movie 1.  A story 2.  A choreographer 3.  A Screenplay writer 4.  A stunt coordinator 5.  A story Did I already say that?  6.  A director  preferably one who is not mentally challenged although even one who was challenged could have done a better job 7.  Anil KapoorBubonic plague  Avoid at all costs 8.  A statutory warning  Watching Yash Raj movies is Injurious to your mental health ? Things I liked about the movie 1.  Kareena Kapoor  For obvious reasons 2.  The English subtitles  Mera Dil Kho Gaya becomes  My heart is in a void , Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya turns into Im a flirt, Im a lover, Im a vagabond ..priceless.In short, Tashan to me, is like the opposite of a Rubrics cube  The cube is supposed to increase the IQ of the player, Tashan promises to lower your IQ, and that.. in a mere 2.5 hours!  Woot! sigh..But thats just me.  I could be wrong You have been warned anyways.",
		"This is the biggest Flop of 2008.  Director has big disaster I don big disaster The songs have been added without situations, the story have been stretched to fill the 3 hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it is like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people.  Only the best performance was by Anil Kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking Hinglish...  Akki is also done a good job....  But the movieee just forget it.",

		"All the world said that the film Tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure, but this is not the case.  Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress Kareena Kapoor.  She was unbearable throughout the film.  Her tomboy look does not really goes well.  Even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all.  Everyone said that the Quetin Taratino of India is Vijay but its not at all Quetin.  The talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid movie.  Anil is large caliber Anil is large caliber Akshay Kumar has also been a victim of this film as all is Saif.  The Style and the Phoormola is not really good in this film i was disappointed",
		"I was 1st season I was political statement Screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes mens sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women.  The episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists.  Then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home.  I assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak, but is unclear because this is never revisited.  The episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah.It seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end.  The worst episode.  Well, except for chocolate.",

I personally think the script by Sam Hamm sucks, it takes itself far too seriously  I do not really understand why it is part of the Masters of Horror series, the horror that the filmmakers are going for in The Screwfly Solution is in the actual story itself  themes  ideas it brings up rather than on screen visual horror particularly the tenuous ecological message it sees intent on ramming down our throats whenever it is gets the chance during it is short 60 odd minute running time which I felt itself was a problem as the thing just finishes out of what could easily be interpreted as necessity rather than any meaningful attempt to wrap things up.  I was not happy with the inconsistencies with the story either, if men only kill when sexually aroused why does the flight attendant casually break that womans neck on the plane?  Was he sexually aroused, I think not.  Why does every bloke then think he is killing in the name of God?  I just cannot see every single bloke on Earth suddenly knowing the Bible  starting to believe in God, I just found the notion ridiculous  the show also states clearly that there is nothing religious about what is going on so what is the deal with everyone thinking they have a divine to murder any woman they see?  Then there is the fact people get turned on by different things, what about gays for instance?  Will they kill guys instead of women?  I know there is a brief scene which makes a joke out of the gay issue but it is conveniently brushed to one side  then there is the thing which annoyed me the most.  The fact that presumably every bloke on earth has turned psycho  killed all the women they go about their everyday business like nothing ever happened, it just felt so stupid, the plotting is rubbish  to round things off there is a ending which looks like it was taken from a rejected episode of The XFiles 1993  2002 with a bright neon alien.Director Dante on this showing definitely does not qualify as a Master of Horror as far a I am concerned, the story is badly paced, it is just so stupid considering it is played deadly straight  instead of trying to make a proper horror show he turns in more of a thriller with it is deadly virus on the loose situation  the subsequent mother  daughter on the run because of it, there is very little here in the way of what I would call effective horror  even less gore.  There is a scene when a woman is stabbed with a broken bottle, a brief scene after when a guy stabs his own groin with said bottle  another woman is stabbed in the stomach but nothing else to write home about.Technically like the other episodes it is really good  it does not have the look of a cheap TV series, the special effects are great as usual  it is well made.

		"A huge disappointment from writer Hamm and director Dante.  Their previous collaboration on the first seasons Homecoming was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways.  This poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered.  The supposed payoff showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing.  If the point of the story was an extraterrestrial cleaning of the planet of it is human infestation, why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion?  Why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la Stephen Kings The Stand instead of having the male population butcher the females?  I kept hoping the episode would improve as I kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous.  it was clear Sam I like a lot of both Dante and Hamms work but this was just unwatchable.",

Outside of the gore I really would not call this horror so much as I would science fiction.It is bleak, depressing and hopeless.  While I do not mind a less than cheery ending, I am really very tired of the humans suck clich? that is central to every movie.  I know you cannot get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of selfhatred as a member of the human race, but how is bout as a writerdirector we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the ALIENS KILLING THE HUMAN RACE are evil!  Right now, if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find a lake and swim til your arms are tired.  This way you will not be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me I deserve to die for being alive.  It is silly, not thoughtful, and boring.",

I do cheery ending I know you cannot get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of selfhatred as a member of the human race, but how is bout as a writerdirector we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the ALIENS KILLING THE HUMAN RACE are evil!  Right now, if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find a lake and swim til your arms are tired.  This way you will not be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me I deserve to die for being alive.  It is silly, not thoughtful, and boring.",

		"Warner Bros. made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast paced, economical and very entertaining.  I really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life.  This is one of Warners few hardedged melodramas that simply does not work.  Edward G.  Robinson plays tragic consequences Robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that do not cut the mustard.  H.B.  Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad acting of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second leads really hurts the movie.  Starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie.  In addition, the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of precode Hollywood.  LeRoys direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations.  Sol Politos camera work is strong.  Somehow, this piece of dreck got an Oscar nomination for Best Picture in a year that gave us M, Dracula and Frankenstein.",

		"A little girls dead body is found stripped of all possible means of identification.  When it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other, it is assumed to be the body of a couples missing daughter.  After this trauma, the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence.  All of this changes when one day, many years later, she receives a phone call from her daughter!  With the help of an excop and a reporter, she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is indeed alive.  Los Sin Nombre is a mess plotwise, moves at an achingly slow pace, and is completely unscary.  The saving grace is Emma Vilarasau, who does an outstanding job as the desperate mother.  I am sure it Beware of the English subtitles on the recent R1 releasethey are not very accurate.",

Now as an adult, I can see how the mighty had fallen with S2T See my review.  I have always heard of the backstory on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the originals director, Richard Donner from part II.  It must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously, now it is common Back to the Future and Matrix 2  3 for example.  Unfortunately, after finally seeing the Richard Donner Cut or, S2RD I still cannot fully recommend it.  Gone, was the great Superman change scene, the entire Paris rescue, as was the wonderful recap of part I in S2Ts opening.  In fact, they all but wrote the words Previously on Superman in S2RD.  The special effects were not great in either Part I or S2T , but S2RD, they were mostly downright laughable  such as Lois falling from the Daily Planet window.  I will admit, some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures, such as any scene in the honeymoon suite.  Overall, if you grew up on S2T as I did, and loved it as a child  not nitpicking as I do as an adult, you should absolutely see S2RD as it is almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes.  Spoiler alert Unfortunately, the worst change comes last gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from S2T replaced with the exact same ending as I.  This is not only a lazy, unoriginal copout, it does not make sense on why Clark would go back to that diner, if those events never actually happened.  And will he continue to turn back time for every confrontation?",

		"Superman II  The Richard Donner Cut should be a fans dream come true.  At long last, footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life.  A director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored.  It seems like a winning situation.  you realize real nightmare While it is entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project.  And it is only a very few times.You know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics.  But then we start seeing new footage alternates from Superman  The Movie for the trial and that first bit of hesitation fades away.  Hey, this is pretty neat!  Things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from STM intermixed with new effects for this project, and it does not convince at all.  And from this point on, it never ever lets up.  It is probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects, but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was You will Believe A Man Can Fly it is difficult to believe anything shown on screen here.  The best effects in this are from the original productions.Another issue with this recut.  A lot of it just does not make sense.  The only reason any of it really works is because we have all seen the theatrical version of Superman II, a movie that does make sense.  Lesters Superman II fills in the holes of this assembly.  Part of this could be because Donner did not get to complete shooting, the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little Lester material as possible.  What we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes Superman IV look airtight and coherent.After viewing this, one gets the sense that while Lester was faithful and comfortable using Donner material, Michael Thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by Lester.  The best scenes in The Donner Cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of Superman II.  That includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence, not ironically, both were filmed by Donner.  But anything else from that movie filmed by Lester is reedited in such a hasty fashion, that it now makes Lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing.  While Lester honored the Donner material, Lester here is thrown under the bus.So is there anything good in this release?  Well Marlon Brando is in it, and that is neat to see.  In fact watching any of the material shot by Donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as Superman  The Movie.  But that only highlights the problems of this release.  Any of the major scenes really just Lois jumping and scenes with Marlon Brando would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section.  Instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used sloppy edits and bad decisions.Watch the opening scene at the Daily Planet.  Why are we looking at Jackie Coopers back as he calls for Lois and Clark?  At the end why do we have Lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by Jackie Cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on?  I was initially confused by this, because I expected to see Lois.  The entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this.Battle scenes are a mess too, with no geography between cuts.  It is just random action.  Of course, the major action scenes were shot by Lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of Donner outtakes or alternates.  They should have used more of Lesters footage, but probably had too much pride to admit that.The sloppiness extends to the military missile as well.  As noted elsewhere, the missile shown in The Donner Cut bears the designation XK 10 while we all know it is the XK 101!  A blind man in STM knows that!  The producers of this assembly, who tried so hard to honor the original film, dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production.  For all the supposed care that was put into this, the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable.The entire affair would probably be easier to digest if Warners did not make this a separate release here in the states.  As it is, we are expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a Play All option.  It is really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes, but after that initial viewing, I expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else.  I know after my experience of watching this, I had new respect for Lesters version.  It is by no means perfect, but Lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief.  He managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so, while this new recut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history.",

		"Superman II  The Richard Donner Cut should be a fans dream come true.  At long last, footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life.  A director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored.  It seems like a winning situation.  And then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this esoteric dream is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence.  While it is entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project.  And it is only a very few times.You know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics.  But then we start seeing new footage alternates from Superman  The Movie for the trial and that first bit of hesitation fades away.  Hey, this is pretty neat!  Things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from STM intermixed with new effects for this project, and it does not convince at all.  And from this point on, it never ever lets up.  It is visual effects It is visual effects The best effects in this are from the original productions.Another issue with this recut.  A lot of it just does not make sense.  The only reason any of it really works is because we have all seen the theatrical version of Superman II, a movie that does make sense.  Lesters Superman II fills in the holes of this assembly.  Part of this could be because Donner did not get to complete shooting, the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little Lester material as possible.  What we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes Superman IV look airtight and coherent.After viewing this, one gets the sense that while Lester was faithful and comfortable using Donner material, Michael Thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by Lester.  The best scenes in The Donner Cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of Superman II.  That includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence, not ironically, both were filmed by Donner.  But anything else from that movie filmed by Lester is reedited in such a hasty fashion, that it now makes Lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing.  While Lester honored the Donner material, Lester here is thrown under the bus.So is there anything good in this release?  Well Marlon Brando is in it, and that is neat to see.  In fact watching any of the material shot by Donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as Superman  The Movie.  But that only highlights the problems of this release.  Any of the major scenes really just Lois jumping and scenes with Marlon Brando would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section.  Instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used sloppy edits and bad decisions.Watch the opening scene at the Daily Planet.  Why are we looking at Jackie Coopers back as he calls for Lois and Clark?  At the end why do we have Lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by Jackie Cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on?  I was initially confused by this, because I expected to see Lois.  The entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this.Battle scenes are a mess too, with no geography between cuts.  It is just random action.  Of course, the major action scenes were shot by Lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of Donner outtakes or alternates.  They should have used more of Lesters footage, but probably had too much pride to admit that.The sloppiness extends to the military missile as well.  As noted elsewhere, the missile shown in The Donner Cut bears the designation XK 10 while we all know it is the XK 101!  A blind man in STM knows that!  The producers of this assembly, who tried so hard to honor the original film, dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production.  For all the supposed care that was put into this, the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable.The entire affair would probably be easier to digest if Warners did not make this a separate release here in the states.  As it is, we are expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a Play All option.  It is really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes, but after that initial viewing, I expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else.  I know after my experience of watching this, I had new respect for Lesters version.  It is by no means perfect, but Lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief.

And then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this esoteric dream is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence.  While it is entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project.  And it is only a very few times.You know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics.  But then we start seeing new footage alternates from Superman  The Movie for the trial and that first bit of hesitation fades away.  Hey, this is pretty neat!  Things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from STM intermixed with new effects for this project, and it does not convince at all.  And from this point on, it never ever lets up.  It is probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects, but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was You will Believe A Man Can Fly it is difficult to believe anything shown on screen here.  The best effects in this are from the original productions.Another issue with this recut.  A lot of it just does not make sense.  The only reason any of it really works is because we have all seen the theatrical version of Superman II, a movie that does make sense.  Lesters Superman II fills in the holes of this assembly.  Part of this could be because Donner did not get to complete shooting, the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little Lester material as possible.  What we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes Superman IV look airtight and coherent.After viewing this, one gets the sense that while Lester was faithful and comfortable using Donner material, Michael Thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by Lester.  The best scenes in The Donner Cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of Superman II.  That includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence, not ironically, both were filmed by Donner.  But anything else from that movie filmed by Lester is reedited in such a hasty fashion, that it now makes Lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing.  While Lester honored the Donner material, Lester here is thrown under the bus.So is there anything good in this release?  Well Marlon Brando is in it, and that is neat to see.  In fact watching any of the material shot by Donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as Superman  The Movie.  But that only highlights the problems of this release.  Any of the major scenes really just Lois jumping and scenes with Marlon Brando would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section.  Instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used sloppy edits and bad decisions.Watch the opening scene at the Daily Planet.  Why are we looking at Jackie Coopers back as he calls for Lois and Clark?  At the end why do we have Lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by Jackie Cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on?  I was initially confused by this, because I expected to see Lois.  The entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this.Battle scenes are a mess too, with no geography between cuts.  It is just random action.  Of course, the major action scenes were shot by Lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of Donner outtakes or alternates.  They should have used more of Lesters footage, but probably had too much pride to admit that.The sloppiness extends to the military missile as well.  As noted elsewhere, the missile shown in The Donner Cut bears the designation XK 10 while we all know it is the XK 101!  A blind man in STM knows that!  The producers of this assembly, who tried so hard to honor the original film, dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production.  For all the supposed care that was put into this, the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable.The entire affair would probably be easier to digest if Warners did not make this a separate release here in the states.  As it is, we are expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a Play All option.

		"I was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in North Carolina.  Instead I watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the Duke family.  And this went on and on.  If Mr.  McElwees family had prevailed over the Dukes I doubt that Mr.  McElwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobaccorelated diseases.  I grew up near the area where Mr.  I expected continual focus I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the NC economy and the ramifications to the states economy by tighter regulation of tobacco.  The countless references to the movie Bright Leaves are out of place  So what if Gary Cooper played Mr.  McElwees great grandfather?  Does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film?  I did not.",

It does devious murderer It does devious murderer The plot is basically a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clich?s.

		"I figured that it is about time I let this one out.  Pok?mon fans are suffering in America these days.  Why?  we rely beloved series As far as the series goes, they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television.  So what is their problem when it comes to the movies?  Honestly now, I have seen all three Pok?mon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one.  They are excellent movies.  They are all enjoyable and fun to watch.  And, after seeing Pok?mon 2000 in theaters, I cannot help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts.  The way it appears, it seems that they read and see something that says Insert empty moral here in big bold faced letters.  It definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on MSB extreme sarcasm there and created this crap.possible spoilers from here onWell, I guess I should first talk about Pikachus Rescue Adventure.  My first gripe with this came with no narration.  I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pok?dex narration that plagued Pikachus Vacation, and, instead of going with a caring, gentle womans voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai, they just cut the narration all together.  This would not have been a problem, except for one thing.  Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute did not let Togepi go until the end?  Possibly the fans, but I am sure not the parents.  Then, there is the theme song.  I could not help but roll my eyes at this one.  The Japanese theme song was Tankentai wo Tsukurou and was sung by Japanese children.  It was fun and enjoyable.  This one nauseating.  Now, one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana.  Nice music, fun to watch.  That is changed with the Bellossom.  The music sucked for one, but on top of that, they had all the Pok?mon talk during the music, which turned out to be jumpy, annoying, and just unnecessary.  Oh, and then there is the Poliwhirl who thinks he is a Poliwrath.  You would think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are.  Basically, not much could save this little ill fated dub, which is very unfortunate considering its potential.  But, I have not touched on the worst of it yet.You would think that the warning signs would have been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power.  For some unfathomable reason, I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB.  My thoughts were well, they screwed up on the first movie, but the second is different as far as the theme goes, so they should do well.  That in mind, I just did not pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said, You will believe that one person can make all the difference.  With the way they said that at every turn, I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version.  Then comes Nintendo Power, in which I see all my fears realized in the words the main feature The Power of One.  At that point, I became a bit more uneasy.  The Power of One?!  Not a good sign.  However, I still kept some of my false faith.  Big mistake.Sitting in the theater, I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk.  I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle.  I can see a point in that since they did not pander this thing, repeating it over and over like in MSB.  However, it did more damage than anything else in this movie.  First of all, the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to Ash.  Ah hah.  So, Ash is the chosen one?  Whatever.  In the Japanese version, the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pok?mon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony.  This time, he is the chosen one.  A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia.  Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pok?mon movie.... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia.  In this one, Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash.  In the scene where they are flying back to the main island, Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugias existence, not that Ash is going to make all the difference.  Overall in this category, Ash was not really the one person that would make the difference, since he was helped by many along the way.A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking.  Fururas flute song was not nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one.  Jirarudans speech to them saying his collection started with a Mew card?  Ugh.  Even worse, Mistys outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held.  Why did not you put them in Pok?balls when you caught them?  This is like caging them to be displayed.

Not really to make me laugh out loud, but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach.  Well, that was officially the last American Pok?mon movie I am going to see.  I have imported the third one and find it very enjoyable.  I would rather not see another Japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two.  I will be importing the fourth one as well.  Forget you, Kids WB and 4Kids.  You have forsaken me for the last time.",
		"I figured that it is about time I let this one out.  Pok?mon fans are suffering in America these days.  Why?  Because we rely on Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies.  As far as the series goes, they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television.  So what is their problem when it comes to the movies?  Honestly now, I have seen all three Pok?mon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one.  They are excellent movies They are all enjoyable and fun to watch.  And, after seeing Pok?mon 2000 in theaters, I cannot help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts.  The way it appears, it seems that they read and see something that says Insert empty moral here in big bold faced letters.  It definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on MSB extreme sarcasm there and created this crap.possible spoilers from here onWell, I guess I should first talk about Pikachus Rescue Adventure.  My first gripe with this came with no narration.  I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pok?dex narration that plagued Pikachus Vacation, and, instead of going with a caring, gentle womans voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai, they just cut the narration all together.  This would not have been a problem, except for one thing.  Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute did not let Togepi go until the end?  Possibly the fans, but I am sure not the parents.  Then, there is the theme song.  I could not help but roll my eyes at this one.  The Japanese theme song was Tankentai wo Tsukurou and was sung by Japanese children.  It was fun and enjoyable.  This one nauseating.  Now, one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana.  Nice music, fun to watch.  That is changed with the Bellossom.  The music sucked for one, but on top of that, they had all the Pok?mon talk during the music, which turned out to be jumpy, annoying, and just unnecessary.  Oh, and then there is the Poliwhirl who thinks he is a Poliwrath.  You would think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are.  Basically, not much could save this little ill fated dub, which is very unfortunate considering its potential.  But, I have not touched on the worst of it yet.You would think that the warning signs would have been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power.  For some unfathomable reason, I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB.  My thoughts were well, they screwed up on the first movie, but the second is different as far as the theme goes, so they should do well.  That in mind, I just did not pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said, You will believe that one person can make all the difference.  With the way they said that at every turn, I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version.  Then comes Nintendo Power, in which I see all my fears realized in the words the main feature The Power of One.  At that point, I became a bit more uneasy.  The Power of One?!  Not a good sign.  However, I still kept some of my false faith.  Big mistake.Sitting in the theater, I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk.  I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle.  I can see a point in that since they did not pander this thing, repeating it over and over like in MSB.  However, it did more damage than anything else in this movie.  First of all, the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to Ash.  Ah hah.  So, Ash is the chosen one?  Whatever.  In the Japanese version, the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pok?mon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony.  This time, he is the chosen one.  A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia.  Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pok?mon movie.... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia.  In this one, Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash.  In the scene where they are flying back to the main island, Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugias existence, not that Ash is going to make all the difference.  Overall in this category, Ash was not really the one person that would make the difference, since he was helped by many along the way.A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking.  Fururas flute song was not nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one.  Jirarudans speech to them saying his collection started with a Mew card?  Ugh.  Even worse, Mistys outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held.  Why did not you put them in Pok?balls when you caught them?  This is like caging them to be displayed.

		"I figured that it is about time I let this one out.  Pok?mon fans are suffering in America these days.  Why?  Because we rely on Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies.  As far as the series goes, they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television.  So what is their problem when it comes to the movies?  Honestly now, I have seen all three Pok?mon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one.  They are excellent movies.  They are all enjoyable and fun to watch.  And, after seeing Pok?mon 2000 in theaters, I cannot help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts.  The way it appears, it seems that they read and see something that says Insert empty moral here in big bold faced letters.  It definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on MSB extreme sarcasm there and created this crap.possible spoilers from here onWell, I guess I should first talk about Pikachus Rescue Adventure.  My first gripe with this came with no narration.  I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pok?dex narration that plagued Pikachus Vacation, and, instead of going with a caring, gentle womans voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai, they just cut the narration all together.  This would not have been a problem, except for one thing.  Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute did not let Togepi go until the end?  Possibly the fans, but I am sure not the parents.  Then, there is the theme song.  I could not help but roll my eyes at this one.  The Japanese theme song was Tankentai wo Tsukurou and was sung by Japanese children.  It was fun and enjoyable.  This one nauseating.  Now, one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana.  Nice music, fun to watch.  That is changed with the Bellossom.  The music sucked for one, but on top of that, they had all the Pok?mon talk during the music, which turned out to be jumpy, annoying, and just unnecessary.  Oh, and then there is the Poliwhirl who thinks he is a Poliwrath.  You would think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are.  Basically, not much could save this little ill fated dub, which is very unfortunate considering its potential.  But, I have not touched on the worst of it yet.You would think that the warning signs would have been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power.  For some unfathomable reason, I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB.  My thoughts were well, they screwed up on the first movie, but the second is different as far as the theme goes, so they should do well.  That in mind, I just did not pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said, You will believe that one person can make all the difference.  With the way they said that at every turn, I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version.  Then comes Nintendo Power, in which I see all my fears realized in the words the main feature The Power of One.  At that point, I became a bit more uneasy.  The Power of One?!  Not a good sign.  However, I still kept some of my false faith.  Big mistake.Sitting in the theater, I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk.  I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle.  I can see a point in that since they did not pander this thing, repeating it over and over like in MSB.  However, it did more damage than anything else in this movie.  First of all, the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read the world turns to Ash.  Ah hah.  So, Ash is the chosen one?  Whatever.  In the Japanese version, the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pok?mon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony.  This time, he is the chosen one.  A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia.  Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pok?mon movie.... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia.  In this one, Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash.  In the scene where they are flying back to the main island, Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugias existence, not that Ash is going to make all the difference.  he was other stuff Fururas flute song was not nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one.  Jirarudans speech to them saying his collection started with a Mew card?  Ugh.  Even worse, Mistys outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held.  Why did not you put them in Pok?balls when you caught them?  This is like caging them to be displayed.  Much different from whining about him thinking Pok?mon are things to be collected like stamps.  If there were any real redeeming values in this, they came from Team Rocket.  Some pretty funny lines.  Not really to make me laugh out loud, but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach.  Well, that was officially the last American Pok?mon movie I am going to see.  I have imported the third one and find it very enjoyable.  I would rather not see another Japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two.  I will be importing the fourth one as well.

There is definitely better examples of both genres.More interesting is that The Ramrodder was filmed at the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and features not one, but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who was probably already in the can for murder at the time this hit the sodastained screens of the Pussycat Theater!",
		"OK so I hear about this new Justin Timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names.  I mean great actors Then we got Kevin Spacey, who I have been a great fan of ever since I watched American Beauty and The Usual Suspects.  Both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as I did when I heard the story.  Then enter a fresh faced Justin Timberlake.  I say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes have not hit him yet.  Well the reason for that , I might add, is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review.  The movie is so terrible that when i got into the first 15 minutes of it.  The characters were so one dimensional that it makes some Bible characters look like the Don Corleone.  They got the one liners and soundbite worthy stuff.  The token troubled black guy LL COOL J who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life.  The captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone.  And what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience.  Oh and lots of gun fire, i mean a whole lot.  SPOILERNOT!!!  THe kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who is crooked dead and the hero prevails.  They got flame throwers and rocket launchers, REally no kidding.Bottom line if you want to see Edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors, or a great fan of Justin Timberlake, to all the 13 year old girls out there, enjoy!!  I wish i had more hands, because then I would have more thumbs, because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening.MAY GD HAVE MERCY ON US ALL and save us from these terrible movies.  Well it could be worst, another RNB terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher, hehe check out IN THE MIX lol, or even Get rich or die trying.

Towelhead is human drama I have human drama The screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by Alicia Erian.  The famous Edith Wharton quote comes to mind I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the authors political views.  That observation is especially devastating for Towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic.  If there ever was a time when Towelheads white male villains, condescending portrayals of blacks, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc., were fresh, it is long past.For a more detailed review, please look up any of the many professional reviews available online.  Almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on.On the other hand, the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled.  As you read through the reviews in this and similar sites, you will frequently come across superlatives stunning, breathtaking, profound, shocking, ...  It embarrasses me to read them, but it does not surprise me.  Indeed, I have encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial, cultural, gender, or sexual issues as deeply moving, thought provoking, full of profound insight.  If you are such a person, by all means, rent Towelhead and be moved by it.  On the other hand, if you set your standards higher, you can safely pass on this one.",

		"I paid meaningless movie My points;Film is based on 2 things;1 Ethnical point of View As it happens on most of the American Films, the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about the Asian culture.  But unfortunately it is not enough.  Knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods does not make a person understand a culture.  For example shaving is the sign of clean life in Asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that.  Lebanese people are Christian Ok they got that and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arabic countries.  The main difference between eastern and western culture is we do not make ethnocentrism.  So we do not judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film. 2 Sexual revolution of a girl There is nothing much to say about this.  Show me 10 girls which had these on their sexual awakening than I will say that I am wrong.I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre.  Please watch Dr.Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor.  A black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it.  Where is the truth?

		"Hollywoods misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits.  For every Godfather II, there are dozens of More American Graffitis, Stayin Alives, and Grease 2s.  While the original Grease is not a great film, the 1977 adaptation of the longrunning Broadway hit does have songs evocative of the 1960s, energetic choreography, and an appealing cast.  When Paramount began work on a followup, the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster.Fortunately for moviegoers, Michelle Pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts.  Pfeiffer does tuneless songs Maxwell Caulfield, however, lacks even the skill to express embarrassment, and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic.  What romantic interest, beyond hormones, could the cool sassy Pfeiffer have in the deadpan Caulfield?  That dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory.  Only cameos by veterans such as Eve Arden, Connie Stevens, and Sid Caesar have any wit, although Lorna Luft does rise slightly above the lame material.Reviewers have complained that, because Grease 2 is always compared to the original, the movie comes up lacking.  However, even taken on its own terms, the film is a clunker.  After a frenetic opening number, which evidently exhausted the entire cast, the energy dissipates.  With few exceptions, the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960s, and the only nostalgia evoked is for Our Miss Brooks and Sid Caesars Comedy Hour.  The jokes fall flat, and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer Patricia Birch is clumsy to be polite.  However, worse films have been inflicted on audiences, and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters.  Unfortunately, Grease 2 is not even unintentionally funny.  Instead, the film holds the viewers attention like a bad train wreck.  Just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered, the next scene plunges into even worse carnage.",

First off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it was not really clever, not to mention they just used the same characters, but with different names and actors.  Tell me, how did the Pink Ladies and TBirds continue years on after the former gangs left?  Not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy, gee, what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these TBirds were just stupid and ridiculous.Another year at Rydell and the music and dancing has not stopped.  But when a new student who is Sandys cousin comes into the scene, he is love struck by a pink lady, Stephanie.  But she must stick to the code where only Pink Ladies must stick with the TBirds, so the new student, decides to train as a TBird to win her heart.  So he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the TBirds butts.  But will he tell Stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own?  Well, find out for yourself.Grease 2 is like a silly TV show of some sort that did not work.  The gang did not click as well as the first Grease did, not to mention Frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable, because I thought that she graduated from Rydell, but apparently she did not.  The songs were not really that catchy; I am glad that Michelle was able to bounce back so fast, but that is probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel, I would not really recommend this film, other than if you are curious, but I warned you, this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical.210",

		"When I was 11, Grease 2 was like crack.  It was addictive experience My sister and I would watch it, rewind it, and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another.  So, if you are an 11year old girl, and you reviewed this film as brilliant or fun or better than the original Grease, you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass.If, however, you are not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything but an inane, artless, slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production, distribution, andor consumption.For the sake of criticism, I will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows 1.  In a wellexecuted musical, the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters.  In Grease 2, with a few debatable exceptions, to the music is obscenely pointless.  Most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way Score Tonight, Reproduction, Do It For Our Country, and Prowlin without making one concrete statement about any of the films characters or themes.  Plus, all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance.2.  The Tbirds should be badass, and if not at least somewhat likable, but instead each of them is an annoying wussydufusloser.  In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred Tbird jacket and initiates him into the gang, Michael should kick it to the ground, spit on it, and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it.  But of course, he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads, there is no greater honor than to be one with the Tbirds. 3.  Since Michael is beautiful, smart, kind, resourceful, and above average in everyway his musical impotence notwithstanding, it is feasible that Stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask.  Stephanie, on the other hand, is a slovenly, slackjawed, bubble gum smacking, dirty sweatshirt wearing, gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat.  So aside from being pretty I guess, she harbors no likable characteristics, thus, audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of Michaels attraction to her.I could go on and on, but I did not want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair.  I will say this though, to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old times sake Grease 2 is an experience akin to reliving your first kiss.  Only you are 32 now and kissing a snotnosed 13year old kid with acne and slobby braces.  The magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed.  Trust me.",

		"I found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film.  I managed great fun.The The plot line is hugely over stated and dull, the acting is awful, especially from Justin TImberlake who should really stick to what he is good at looking daft and singing like a castrato.  Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and Timberlake meet.  Freeman and Timberlakes characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of fatherson relationship of sorts or something, which simply is not evident at all apart from the fact that; though Freemans character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of Timberlake, he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up.It would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line, which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion.Do not watch this film, it is a pure waste of time.",

		"I laughed rotten movie It is so unbelievable.  A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a breakdown in front of a real estate office.  What happens?  The office manager comes outside and offers her a job!!!  Hilarious!  Next thing you know the two women are going at it.  Yep, they are lesbians!  Nothing rings true in this Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do movie.  Clunky dialogue like I do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and did not take it does not help.  There is a wealthy, distant mother who disapproves of her daughters new relationship.  A sassy black maid  unbelievable that in the year 2003, a film gets made in which there is a sassy black maid.  Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave.  The woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids.  Sheesh!  No cliche is left unturned.",
		"They changed Unexpected Love The only thing worse is the film itself.  The script contains dialogue that would be laughed out of a third grade play recital.  At one point when the wife leaves the husband, a bad cover of All by Myself plays over the soundtrack!  No kidding.  The actors try but are defeated by the inept, unbelievably terrible script.  Direction is staggeringly bad.  No wonder Lifetime has such a bad reputation.  How do things like this get made.  I am turning off the television before it is over!",
		"homosexuals are unhappy marriage It almost seems as if Kates gender preferences turned on and off like a switch, making this film seem a little simplistic.Also, as is common with films that are trying to push an agenda, it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval over the gay lifestyle were labeled as bigots.  And there was no happy medium.  It was either Kates friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally shunned her.  This is not typical of interactions between gay and nongay relatives and friends.  It is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play.  It is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily condoning the choices they make.  Sadly, the movie showed none of these types of interactions.  For a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance, it struck me as very intolerant movie!  Then at the end, Kate apparently decides after all these years she wants to be with Mac and everything is hunky dory  is that what being gay is really all about?  Come on!",

I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto, morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set.  The answer is subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it.The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies.  Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face.The main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent.  Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA.  Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse, and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment.The sets are excruciatingly bad.  The production designers budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint Precinct 707 on a cardboard wall.Since the actors were obviously unpaid nonprofessionalsa sad assortment of European emigres possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands, bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middleaged womenand since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuinelooking police uniforms.  Sadly, they could not afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental.More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him.  One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he is the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies.  The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated.The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her.  Do not ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommels logic and enjoy the absurd ride.After much prolonged handclawing out of strawcovered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance.  They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor makeup generously airbrushed around their eyes.  Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Eurotrash techno into the soundtrack.  We are talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise.  Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.Unlike other zombies, Lommels girls speak and function as normal... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified.  This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog.  Yes, a golden shower it is.I will not spoil anything by revealing the shock ending.

		"This movie is a joke.  I mean funny joke Why?  Because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh I got at the sheer ridiculousness of nonsensical, inane plot and horrible acting.  Wow! Within this movie there are so many unanswered questions... for example; why do these women become zombies and how?  Why are there four black women who are zombies caretakers and what is their purpose?  Since when does 6 people make up a nation of Zombies?  And is smeared black eye mascara scary to anyone, anywhere?  Even a 2 year old? And lastly; Why was this movie made at all?  Why?  why?  why?  No answer?  That is what I thought.On the demand channel they actually issued this comment after the synopsis of the movie We apologize for this movie in advance LOL.  At least they had the decency to do this much!",
		"I cannot believe that this movie was ever created.  I think artistic piece I think artistic piece The zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup.  The zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes.  Finally, there are maybe five or six zombies total, definitely not a nation.  The best part of the movie, if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished.  Again to reiterate other user comments, the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie.  Also, there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all.  It is never explained.",

		"Seriously crappy movie.First off, the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehousefurniture store.  The bad cop takes a girl, which they had pulled over, into the warehouses attic, while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there.  everything is bad cop he thinks bad cop he asks bad cop But eventually people start to catch on, which took awhile considering how fing obvious it was.  One girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies, like ya do.  Now, the bad cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch, and then he gets rid of the duffelbagged body.Since she had the oogeyboogey magic put on her, she comes back with lots of eyeshadow on, which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie... also, the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become eyeshadow monsters.  Some of the girls meet up with a dude, who is apparently a currency specialist, and he offers them a ride they look normal to him apparently.  But when the girls see other people, such as the one girls husband, he freaks out because she is hideous some people freak out, but others do not even notice.... massive plot hole.So, to wrap it up, the eyeshadow monsters kill the bad cop, who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene.  It was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel!  Like anyone would want to see part 2 of this cow dropping.",

		"I cant believe blockbuster carries this movie.  It was SO BAD.  I was totally fooled by the box art.  Do not BE FOOLED!!  Its not worth your time I promise you.  I do positive reviews I am so disappointed.   The description on the back of the box does not even match!  The girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper.  The synopsis on the back says she is only 17.  Did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it!?  Those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be.  If anyone actually liked this flick then I have lost all faith in humanity.And do not even get me started on the story compared to the title.  Or the fact that the entire movie was done all in 2 locations.  Or that the cops did not even have close to real uniforms.  Why would i even say that??  Who cares about the cops uniforms!?  Compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on.  This movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans.",

		"I stopped by BB and picked up 4 zombie flicks to watch over the weekend.  Now, I understand that the effects will be cheesy, the acting will be subpar, and the sets will be suspect.  So I am not expecting much.  But it should at least have a story.  Stories do new wave The picture of the zombie on the front cover NEVER appears in the movie.  It was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre.The running time is only 81 minutes but it felt like 2 hours.  According to my wife who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room, it sounded like zombie porn....which if you think about, sounds kinda gross.....but it was not even that good.The only suggestion I can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess.It ended up being a free rental and I still feel ripped off.  I rated it a 1 out of 10 because IMDb will not allow me to use decimals.",

Which does not say much.The Cover Art was good but very deceiving...as was the Main Menu of the DVD...great artwork and music.DONT BOTHER!",
		" REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS  I will make this review short and sweet.  I bought top actors How bad could it be, right?  Well, it is pretty bad.  Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at Edisons Police Force.  LL Cool J is Deed, a cop within the force on a special force team called F.R.A.T.  First Response Assault Tactics.  He is teamed with an ontheedge bad cop named Lazerov Dylan McDermott.  In the opening scene we see Lazerov  Deed taking on some bank robbers, but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs.  I do not want to give to much away, but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs.  Pollack, who works for Ashford Morgan Freeman goes to a trial involving Deeds  Lazerov.  He suspect foul play and with the help of Ashford, does some investigate that turns ugly.  Wallace Kevin Spacey who is all within the F.R.A.T. team joins with Ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice.You can tell from the beginning that Freeman and Spaceys performance are pretty lackluster.  The only person that give a all out performance is Dylan McDermott.  He is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me.  LL Cool J is terrible in this film.  He says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion.  He was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea  Any Given Sunday.  The film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film.  The ending is far from satisfying.Do not waste your time with this film.  I am putting it on Ebay this weekend.",

I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman.  How bad could it be, right?  Well, it is pretty bad.  Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at Edisons Police Force.  LL Cool J is Deed, a cop within the force on a special force team called F.R.A.T.  First Response Assault Tactics.  He is teamed with an ontheedge bad cop named Lazerov Dylan McDermott.  In the opening scene we see Lazerov  Deed taking on some bank robbers, but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs.  I do not want to give to much away, but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs.  Pollack, who works for Ashford Morgan Freeman goes to a trial involving Deeds  Lazerov.  He suspect foul play He suspect foul play Wallace Kevin Spacey who is all within the F.R.A.T. team joins with Ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice.You can tell from the beginning that Freeman and Spaceys performance are pretty lackluster.  The only person that give a all out performance is Dylan McDermott.  He is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me.  LL Cool J is terrible in this film.  He says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion.  He was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea  Any Given Sunday.  The film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film.  The ending is far from satisfying.Do not waste your time with this film.

		"OK its not the best film I have ever seen but at the same time I have been able to sit and watch it TWICE!!!  he stopped silly name",
		"If ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating it is this pile of crap.  I love bad ones I actually began to feel angry watching this film because it is so insultingly poor, I cannot believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable.There is no plot and the nonplot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking.  The people do not react, act or in any way resemble human beings.  The entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be.  The whole thing is one pointless mess, it does not go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and do not do very much.I could make a better film than this, so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before.  It is pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time.Honestly, the very worst movie of all time.  You will note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a 1010 and urge you to BUY the DVD.  I cannot imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film, it is terrible.010 and that is generous.",

Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that is not true; the idiot who directed this junk is the WORST director ever.The American cop has a German accent!  The police station was a desk in a warehouse with a sign Police Station hanging on the wall.  There is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about TEN FEET.This cop pulls women over, cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse.  He tells his cop partner to wait in the car.  Then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag.  The cop partner thinks maybe something is not right, that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women, but he is not sure if that is what is happening because  he is a moron!  The dialog is totally stupid, the acting is awful, and the characters act in the stupidest manner I have ever seen on screen.  It is totally obvious to the cops partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it, and yet, the partner, who is there all along, does not know what is happening!  The director of this film is a total hack.  I stopped the movie at 30 minutes because I could not take it anymore.

		"Zombie Nation 2004 RHey, I was bored.  I looked little box Zombie Nation?  Hey, I love zombie movies.  Says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description.  Funny how it does not warn me not to watch this film.  I could have used that advice.Zombie Nation is just like Troll 2 in that it is completely misnamed.  It has little if anything, depending on your point of view to do with zombies, and takes place all within one city.  This film revolves around a crooked cop, who acts as badly as possible he has to be trying to suck this much, while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them.  Yup, he is a serial killer cop.  Not only is this film flawed in thinking that it is a zombie flick, it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong.  Serial killers enjoy killing, they live for it and they get down and personal with it.  This guy knocks out the women, and injects them with some poison.  He does not even have sex with the corpse or dismember it.  Talk about boring!  Eventually, one of the whopping five women he kills has Voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason, all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy.  They were all buried or tossed into the ocean, but you would not know it buy the sharp clean clothes they are all wearing.  The women then act very poorly and take their revenge.  Oh yay.This film was crap in every category.  Crap acting, crap writing, crappier sets, and crappier makeup effects.  The women do not look zombielike, unless you count really dark makeup around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie.  They can all talk, behave, think, and act perfectly human.  The gore is weak compared to even many PG13 films and the nudity is beyond brief.  You see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence...  Then the exact same breasts later!  Go figure.  Guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite.  The police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they are obviously filming in.  You can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse setup and even, unless you are blind, you can see the director failing.  Steer clear, it is a waste of time.110",

		"he is unseated fellow This film is as shoddy and laughable as the bestworst of EW.  I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto, morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set.  The answer is subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it.The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies.  Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face.The main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent.  Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA.  Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse, and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment.The sets are excruciatingly bad.  The production designers budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint Precinct 707 on a cardboard wall.Since the actors were obviously unpaid nonprofessionalsa sad assortment of European emigres possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands, bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middleaged womenand since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuinelooking police uniforms.  Sadly, they could not afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental.More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him.  One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he is the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies.  The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated.The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her.  Do not ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommels logic and enjoy the absurd ride.After much prolonged handclawing out of strawcovered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance.  They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor makeup generously airbrushed around their eyes.  Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Eurotrash techno into the soundtrack.  We are talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise.  Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.Unlike other zombies, Lommels girls speak and function as normal... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified.  This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog.  Yes, a golden shower it is.I will not spoil anything by revealing the shock ending.

		"German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible he is unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made.Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium.  This film is as shoddy and laughable as the bestworst of EW.  I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto, morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set.  Lommel dug international nobodies Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face.The main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent.  Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA.  Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse, and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment.The sets are excruciatingly bad.  The production designers budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint Precinct 707 on a cardboard wall.Since the actors were obviously unpaid nonprofessionalsa sad assortment of European emigres possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands, bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middleaged womenand since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuinelooking police uniforms.  Sadly, they could not afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental.More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him.  One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he is the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies.  The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated.The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her.  Do not ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommels logic and enjoy the absurd ride.After much prolonged handclawing out of strawcovered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance.  They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor makeup generously airbrushed around their eyes.  Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Eurotrash techno into the soundtrack.  We are talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise.  Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.Unlike other zombies, Lommels girls speak and function as normal... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified.  This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog.  Yes, a golden shower it is.I will not spoil anything by revealing the shock ending.

		"BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is, he loves his crap.I have never seen a Ulli Lommel film but I was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful.  Like the movies I said in the beginning do not even equal a six when added together!  After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy really is.  He is pathetic movie The acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots.  The editing is easily the worst.  This movie made no sense and I unbearably could not take it anymore as it would not end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie.  I could not take it anymore.  I wasted 45 minutes of my life.DO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP!",
		"I rented last week I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it, so it seemed promising.  And it was, until Justin Timberlake came on scene.  He is a really bad actor and should not be allowed to make a movie ever again.  I mean, he is one of the most boring, uninspired actors I have ever seen.  He puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever.  Why the hell was he cast for the role of Josh Pollack?  I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice.Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment.  His character is so dull, it seems like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en.  It might sound cool, but believe me, it is not.Now, Dylan McDermotts acting is very good.  It is about one of the very few good things about this movie.  He is just inspired.Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special.  He has some really cool lines though.About the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good.  I was expecting a big twist when Lazerov Dylan McDermott was killed, but nothing really happened.",

It looked like a movie that my friends and I could have put together on our own.  The case the movie came in is definitely a disguise.  Nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case.  It appears that the director or makeup artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie.  The credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie.  Which watching the credits was the best part of the movie.  This was honestly an awful movie and I could not believe how badly it was put together.  Scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like whats going on?  The audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teens joking around making a fake fight scene.IF you are considering renting or buying this movie I would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show is how awful it truly is.  I wish i would have watched it before i rented it.",

		"Yet another early film from Alfred Hitchcock which seems to have been done out of contractual obligation.  Hitchcock had little interest There is almost no style or craft to it at all.  The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young married couple, who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage.  Emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted, wealthy man who falls in love with her, but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband.  This might seem more believable if Fred were not made out to be a completely insensitive, pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman.  The couple ends up staying together, but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene.  The third act goes in a completely different direction, with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian fishing boat.  Joan Barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband.  That is about all you can say for this one.",

Only they are not active participants in the resolution, and except for the fate of a friendly cat, nothing about the ending resonates.At least you get some enjoyable views of London in the early 1930s, and a chance to see Hitchcock when he was still working for food.

		"Granting the budget and time constraints of serial production, BATMAN AND ROBIN nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any cliffhanger list, utterly lacking the style, imagination, and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor, BATMAN.The producer, Sam Katzman, was known as King of the Quickies and, like his director, Spencer Bennett, seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement.  Unfortunately, this team also produced the two Superman serials, starring Kirk Alyn, with their tacky flying animation, canned music, and dull supporting players.  Robin Rescues cheap Halloween Batmans cowl, with its devils horns and eagles beak, fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes.  His utility belt is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments, from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments! In any case, the lead players are miscast.  Robert Lowery displays little charm or individual flair as Bruce Wayne, and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as Batman.  He creates the impression that he would rather be somewhere, anywhere else!  John Duncan, as Robin, has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue.  He is too old for the part, with an even older stuntman filling in for him.  Out of costume, Lowery and Duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink, without one ounce of the chemistry evident between Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft in the 1943 serial.Although serials were not known for character development, the earlier BATMAN managed to present a more energetic cast.  This one offers a group going through the motions, not that the filmmakers provide much support.  Not one of the hoodlums stands out, and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever, The Wizard.  Great name!  Actually, they are led by someone sporting a curtain, a shawl, and a sack over his head, with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing.  The prime suspects  an eccentric professor, a radio broadcaster  are simply annoying.Even the established comic book regulars are superfluous.  It is hard to discern much romance between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne.  Despite the perils she faces, Vicki displays virtually no emotion.  Commissioner Gordon is nonetoobright.  Unlike in the previous serial, Alfred the butler is a mere walkon whose most important line is Mr Waynes residence.  They are props for a drawnout, gimmickladen, incoherent plot, further saddled with uninspired, repetitive music and amateurish production design.  The Wayne Manor exterior resembles a suburban middleclass home in any sitcom, the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel.  The Batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing.  The costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet! Pity that the filmmakers could not invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure.  While the availability of the two serials on DVD is a plus for any serious Batfan, one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box.  They capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of BATMAN AND ROBIN combined.Now for the good news  this is not the 1997 version!",

It was Blue Peter They would always say things like; Go into your loft and you may find this.. or Go into your back garden tonight and...   what about us scummy working class kids who never never had a loft, and a back garden which was nothing more than a 1 meter square of balcony on the 14th floor of a council block?  Public service broadcasting  yeah right!  And on top of that, it was awfully depressing to see those stupid, middle class, uptheirownbackside kids mess about with bits of old plastic having fun... do me a favour, and why do not you go and slit your wrists or do a coke overdose on Mama and Papas money... you make me sick",

		"I can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is.  I was entertaining action I can honestly say I would rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again.  The acting was so awful that it was almost funny.  The story was insanely weak, with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an F117 through them.  The script was so poor, if I found out that a 10 year old wrote it I should not be in the least surprised.  The direction and production is so amateur, I would not even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video.  Utter Utter drivel.  Those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art, and they should be ashamed of themselves.  Steven Segal should never ever show his face in public again, I cannot imagine what made him agree to star in this, the worst film I have seen in my entire life.",

Seagal does have some sweet action sequences, specifically in the store, and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife.  Next time give me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people, and do not even bother with a story line, because the storyline not only stunk, but so did the acting, the fact that F18s and F14s somehow changed into F16s, and also the fact that the Stealth was as fast as an F16.  Also the Stealth never had to refuel???  And since when is Afghanistan considered hostile territory from an Air Force stand point. last I checked, Afghanistan has no Air Force, we USA control the skies.  Also, this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room, yet the Admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret.  Also, how did Seagal go from the bottom of the truck, to the top?  PLease tell us why they jailed him, Since when are Air Force pilots great commandos unless they are Owen Wilson?  And since when are their drunks in Arab countries, considering Muslims do not drink alcohol?  Also on top of that, since when do Arabs listen to orders from females like the 2 in charge?

This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again.It was released only on video I cannot imagine why and I suspect the workers that had to make the DVDs had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling.",

		"STAR RATING  Saturday Night  Friday Night  Friday Morning  Sunday Night  Monday Morning The American military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other.  A renegade pilot Steve Touissant steals it and plots to hold the US government to ransom with it.  So they are forced to send in their best man John Sands Seagal, who else?  to stop him, in exchange for his freedom from a detention centre where his mind was to be wiped of all the incriminating information he is learned over the years.I skipped Attack Force because I could tell from the cover and all the post production tampering that had occurred that it would be crap and when all the negative reviews and low user rating came pouring in it just confirmed what I thought.  Seagal was favourite action Seagal was great film Oh what a fool I was.Dubbing, horrendous stock footage of aerial stealth fighter jets, awful camera work, cheap production values, risible, unconvincing fight scenes that have become Seagals trademark and a boring, sleep inducing plot that does not go anywhere.Thankfully his next film, Once Upon a Time in the Hood which I will be skipping, apparently marks the end of his contract with Sony, meaning no more of these awful European lensed action films and his next film Prince of Pistols might mark a return to theatres.  Hell, he is done it before and Stallone will have managed to do it before him Rocky Balboa.  This is not a Flight of Fury.  It is not even a flight of fun.  It is a flight that fails to even take off the ground. ",
		"you are horrendous excuse I mean its not just bad, its barely coherent.The Acting  Unbelievably wooden.  Literally seen better acting in pornos.  Ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a lesbian love scene which is utterly cringeworthy.Special Effects  would not look out of place in a 60s sword and sorcery flick.Unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures, do not make the same mistake as i did and buy this DVD, as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back.",
		"he killed few people The story is not interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story, characters of movie as a whole such as the lesbian interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet is not even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it did not need to.In short a terrible script with bad dialog, delivered by subpar actors, boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes, and nonrelevant parts that only serve to achieve the nearimpossible and make the movie even worse.Save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss, even if you are Seagals most ardent fan.",
		"I just watched this movie on Starz.  me go special effects It also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie.  Apparently back in 2007, when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for 75 million.  Nowadays those things cost about 3 billion and they cant go invisible.  Apparently you can fly from the US to the middle east in an hour.  There was a completely random lesbian scene, which I did not mind, but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it.  The camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes.  Oh yeah, since its a Steven Segal movie, its predictable as hell.  All in all I rank it right up there with Snakes on a Plane.",

		"Nobody could like this movie for its merit but, if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their MST3 quality, then this is for you.  It ranks preposterous characters The bad writing really cracked me up I want you to dust those guys off instead of . . . dust those guys.  F14s take off from the carrier but, when they get into formation, they are F16s!  Without a hint of anger or skepticism, Segal goes back to work for the general who, only minutes before, was overseeing a covert mind wipe on Seagal.  Segal runs out of bullets and resorts to a knife to kill the guards.  So naturally, the guards all drop their guns and fight with knives too!  The hand grenade is a dud but explodes anyway.  The little stealth fighter can fly all the way from California to Afganistan without refueling.  Then Segal flies it back to California  the long way, i.e., by way of Europe  even though there is a carrier giving him air support 20 minutes away in the Arabian Sea.  The CIC in the carrier consists of 3 black PCs, 2 flat screen TVs and pictures of gauges and maps on the walls.  What a hoot!",
		"First of all, f117 is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft.Secondly, the f14s and f18s cannot change their appearances; they are not transformers.  Thirdly, the f16 has only one m61 cannon, not two.  Last but not the least, at the end of the film, Seagle selected sidewinder missile.  But somehow when he pulled the trigger, the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick.  As I have the experience of seeing f18s and f14s being mysteriously transformed into f16s, this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me.  I have bad work Now I think for the sake of properly marking this film, IMDb should seriously consider adding a 010 option.  Otherwise, it is not fair for those who receive 1 out of 10...",
		"Over the years I have seen a bunch of these straight to video Segal movies, and every one holds the same amount of entertainment; unfortanetley, the entertainment level is at a low.  Sure, the action sequences were amusing, but that was pretty much it.  Seagal was good use Just when the movie seemed to just drag on, a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter.  I honestly believe that more of Segals movies would do better if he was not the only one that fans recognize in the movie.  Supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing, and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses, maybe the movie will get more popular results.",
		"You have other faults You have good taste If you pick a Seagal movie, chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it.  And usually, they do not function as mere eye candy; they get involved in the action and fight, shoot guns, kill with knives, etc.  Flight of Fury offers the duo of Ciera Payton who has a very sexy face, with luscious lips to match Angelina Jolies and Katie Jones, and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight AND a little lesbian fondling!  And if it seems like I am spending a little too much time talking about them, it is because the rest of the movie, although passable, is so unexciting that it is hard to find much else to talk about.  Ironically, the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself, who looks as if he cannot even be bothered to try to pretend to care.  This being a militarytype actioner, there is very little fighting in it, and he does not fit into his role a stealth fighter pilot, the best in the world, of course very well, which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking. 12",

And usually, they do not function as mere eye candy; they get involved in the action and fight, shoot guns, kill with knives, etc.  Flight of Fury offers the duo of Ciera Payton who has a very sexy face, with luscious lips to match Angelina Jolies and Katie Jones, and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight AND a little lesbian fondling!  And if it seems like I am spending a little too much time talking about them, it is because the rest of the movie, although passable, is so unexciting that it is hard to find much else to talk about.  Ironically, the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself, who looks as if he cannot even be bothered to try to pretend to care.  he does offensive sleepwalking",
		"If you watched this movie you know why I said Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.  Hehehe!!!  Every time they said Jesus, Jesus, Jesus...  I laughed thinking Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this movie?  I cannot believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen.  WTF is Timberlake?  Dreaful acting!  I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job!  I am big fun And his girlfriend was shallow, hollow and annoying as hell.  I was happy when they both were popped in the street.The story was OK and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his bad guy role very well.  The movie was entertaining but I think Timberlake ruined it all.  It would have been much enjoyable without him.By the way, the music was OK, but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a MTV video clip with flashes, low motion and things like that.  Something misplaced for this cops movie I thought.  Maybe they wanted to make a MTV video clip for Timberlake.",

		"Following the appalling Attack Force, chances were that Seagal could only have a step up with Flight Of Fury.  To outstink Attack Force would take some doing.  Flight Of Fury is a marked improvement overall, but still in the grand scheme of thinks, mediocre.  Mediocrity is sad insight Where Attack Force was a hodgepodge of plot lines altered drastically from conception, to filming, to post production, Flight Of Fury keeps the plot line more simple.  Someone steals a hightech stealth fighter, planning to use it to fire chemical weapons which we later, bizarrely discover, will destroy the whole world in 48 hrs.  Seagal has to get the plane back.  It is that simple, no annoying subplots, and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works.  That is not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though, it is pretty poor.  The introduction to side characters is badly done for example.In filmic terms FOF is bad.  It is badly acted by all involved, and Seagal looks bored to tears almost.  He is just got the look of a toddler who is been forced to perform the school nativity against his will, and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness.  Can we blame Seagal though when the material is so unambitious and cruddy?  Not really.  This is the final film of his Castel Studios, multipicture deal.  The producers cannot be bothered to make anything remotely good, promising a 12 or so million dollar budget, and after Seagals obligatory 5 million probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves If the film was made for the remaining 7 million, then I am Elvis Pressley!.  So in that respect why should Seagal put the effort into a film that is already got distribution sorted before it is made.  Fans though may argue, he at least owes them the effort.  He is seriously looking jaded, and the continued use of stand ins and dubovers is further indication of this.  Michael Keusch directs with some efficiency, while the cinematography is quite good, but in all technical areas and as usual with Castel, a bog standard stunt team there is nothing more than mediocrity, and nothing to help the film rise above its material, and bored leading man.  Again there is a few action scenes focusing on characters other than Seagal, which in all truth we do not want to see.Overall the action is not too bad.  It is nice and violent, and on occasion we are treated to a few vintage nasty Seagal beatings, but overall nothing special.  Partly due to a poor stunt crew, and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting.  For me, Shadow Man was a more enjoyable film, because while ignoring the incoherent, jumbled, plot line, there were more vintage Seagal moments, and more of him in centre stage.  He never disappeared for long periods during the film.  Seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here, and reappears after, with little explanation.  There is far too much stock footage used.  Using stock shots is not an entirely horrendous thing, but using it as a crutch is.  We are treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships, all the time, which get annoying.

Flight Of Fury is a marked improvement overall, but still in the grand scheme of thinks, mediocre.  Mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for Seagal these days, a sad insight into his movie careers decline.  Where Attack Force was a hodgepodge of plot lines altered drastically from conception, to filming, to post production, Flight Of Fury keeps the plot line more simple.  Someone steals whole world Seagal has to get the plane back.  It is that simple, no annoying subplots, and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works.  That is not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though, it is pretty poor.  The introduction to side characters is badly done for example.In filmic terms FOF is bad.  It is badly acted by all involved, and Seagal looks bored to tears almost.  He is just got the look of a toddler who is been forced to perform the school nativity against his will, and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness.  Can we blame Seagal though when the material is so unambitious and cruddy?  Not really.  This is the final film of his Castel Studios, multipicture deal.  The producers cannot be bothered to make anything remotely good, promising a 12 or so million dollar budget, and after Seagals obligatory 5 million probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves If the film was made for the remaining 7 million, then I am Elvis Pressley!.  So in that respect why should Seagal put the effort into a film that is already got distribution sorted before it is made.  Fans though may argue, he at least owes them the effort.  He is seriously looking jaded, and the continued use of stand ins and dubovers is further indication of this.  Michael Keusch directs with some efficiency, while the cinematography is quite good, but in all technical areas and as usual with Castel, a bog standard stunt team there is nothing more than mediocrity, and nothing to help the film rise above its material, and bored leading man.  Again there is a few action scenes focusing on characters other than Seagal, which in all truth we do not want to see.Overall the action is not too bad.  It is nice and violent, and on occasion we are treated to a few vintage nasty Seagal beatings, but overall nothing special.  Partly due to a poor stunt crew, and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting.  For me, Shadow Man was a more enjoyable film, because while ignoring the incoherent, jumbled, plot line, there were more vintage Seagal moments, and more of him in centre stage.  He never disappeared for long periods during the film.  Seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here, and reappears after, with little explanation.

		"he has 4th rate I watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does.  When he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong.The plot is unbelievable as a movie, and even if you excuse the visuals, and had read this story as a novel, you would be left wondering why you had even picked up the book.Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation.  He shows no effort and no enthusiasm, and in some scenes he does not show up at all.I hate to repeat other peoples comments, but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic.  The condition of those scenes chopped in, is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time.  The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner.My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie, it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds.

		"Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to be in this film, and be forced to play a partMexican or he would have been suspended.  Believe me , he made the wrong choice!  they made present Miriam Randolph Scott, and as a singer to really make things bad, because she proved one thing, and that is she cannot sing.  The story was not too bad, but with Bogie clearly miscast also, it turned out to be a poor Western that was overlong, and on a low budget, but in fairness, color would not have helped.",
		"It has been said, a city on hill cannot hide itself and Virginia City, Nevada, perched on the side of Mt.  Davidson at 6200 ft. west of Tahoe, is a prime example, or in the context of the movie, should be.  Virginia City exploded in the American dream as a shower of gold and silver, suspiciously the same year the Civil War began.  It was American letters it was famous writer It was famous writer It was also the birthplace of the great Hearst fortune, and the launching pad of John Mackay, who became the wealthiest man in America, the third wealthiest man in the world.  Hey, they should have made the movie about him!  In the 1860s Virginia CIty was THE boomtown of all boomtowns, the home of the big bonanza, at one time the largest metropolitan area west of St.  Louis and East of San Francisco.  But Virginia City the movie misses all that and is more about a hogwash NorthSouth duello between the characters played by Errol Flynn and Randolph Scott.  Flynn is Capt.  Kerry Bradford, a Union officer who is a POW in a concentration camp run by a mean Confederate commander named Capt.  Vance Irby, played by Scott.  These two are always getting in each others way.  Bradford escapes and then tries to stop a shipment of gold bullion being snuck out of VC by who else other than . . .  Irby!  Hey, what is he doing here!?  Horrible.  Bogart plays a laughable Mexican bandit who cannot decide who is side he is on.  Miriam Hopkins plays a murky character named Julia Hayne, obviously a historical lunge at the towns first lady, Julia Bulette, who in real life a celebrated prostitute.  She goes to Washington and talks Honest Abe about saving BRADFORD not Irby from hanging and blah blah blah.  Go figure.  They shoulda hung the writer.  In real life Twain reports that on the last day of the War, the setting sun caused the American flag atop Mt.  Davidson to appear to the puzzled residents to be weirdly on fire, kind of like the movie.  Three days later they discovered that on that day the South capitulated.  One interesting quirk in the film is how sidekicks Alan Hale and Guin Williams flick their pistols forward when they shoot, like they are fishing, or trying to make the bullets go faster.  Not a bad idea for the movie.  The same kind of goofiness is lathered over sap and corn throughout the movie.

		"It has been said, a city on hill cannot hide itself and Virginia City, Nevada, perched on the side of Mt.  Davidson at 6200 ft. west of Tahoe, is a prime example, or in the context of the movie, should be.  Virginia City exploded in the American dream as a shower of gold and silver, suspiciously the same year the Civil War began.  It was the birthplace of the dean of American letters; it was where a young reporter named Samuel Clemens began using the name Mark Twain and went on to become Americas most famous writer.  It was great Hearst Hey, they should have made the movie about him!  In the 1860s Virginia CIty was THE boomtown of all boomtowns, the home of the big bonanza, at one time the largest metropolitan area west of St.  Louis and East of San Francisco.  But Virginia City the movie misses all that and is more about a hogwash NorthSouth duello between the characters played by Errol Flynn and Randolph Scott.  Flynn is Capt.  Kerry Bradford, a Union officer who is a POW in a concentration camp run by a mean Confederate commander named Capt.  Vance Irby, played by Scott.  These two are always getting in each others way.  Bradford escapes and then tries to stop a shipment of gold bullion being snuck out of VC by who else other than . . .  Irby!  Hey, what is he doing here!?  Horrible.  Bogart plays a laughable Mexican bandit who cannot decide who is side he is on.  Miriam Hopkins plays a murky character named Julia Hayne, obviously a historical lunge at the towns first lady, Julia Bulette, who in real life a celebrated prostitute.  She goes to Washington and talks Honest Abe about saving BRADFORD not Irby from hanging and blah blah blah.  Go figure.  They shoulda hung the writer.  In real life Twain reports that on the last day of the War, the setting sun caused the American flag atop Mt.  Davidson to appear to the puzzled residents to be weirdly on fire, kind of like the movie.  Three days later they discovered that on that day the South capitulated.  One interesting quirk in the film is how sidekicks Alan Hale and Guin Williams flick their pistols forward when they shoot, like they are fishing, or trying to make the bullets go faster.  Not a bad idea for the movie.  The same kind of goofiness is lathered over sap and corn throughout the movie.

		"it look tiny budget The movie is ostensibly an episode of a live Japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off danger zone and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them.  The survivor, if there is one, wins fame and fortune... everyone else just winds up dead.  The main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad.  None of the real people seem real at all.  The actors playing the killers are kind of fun... because they are portraying cheesy and overthetop caricatures of popular modern horror movie types... and that is exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show.  The movie pretends to be done all in one take... there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the danger zone and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera... but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly to hide the cuts from one take to another, I would imagine.",

		"I have various aspects One thing I see, over and over, is annoyance with Megan, the idealistic political scientist, trying to change the world.  I loved her character.  Maybe, because I am a 23 year old political science student and I think I am going to change the world too, so I relate to Megan.  Besides, she is cute.  She is no super model, but more of a cute girl next door.OK, so she cried and screamed a lot.  It is very dramatic, and seems overdone, but does not it fit her character?  She goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point.  She thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick.  I think she made her argument very well.  Of course, being a young naive girl, she is terrified of what she is about to face.  I think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear.  Furthermore, I think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in.As for the movie in general, other than Megan, it was pretty much what I expected.  It had excellent gore scenes, by microbudget standards.  The plot maybe took a quick thought, hardly any contemplation.  It is basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film, which the name implies.  I love the sadism of the doctor.  He kept ripping Megans shirt off, not just for the cause of sleaze though largely so, but also to torment her, before he kills her.  The Chainsaw hick was hilarious.  For slasher film lovers, he was probably the best character.I give this film 4 out of 10.  It had a good setting, almost no plot, and a mix of good and terrible acting.  I would recommend it for a cheap thrill, but hardly a diamond in the rough that is microbudget horror.",

		"A typical Lanza flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify Lanzas MGM contract at the time.As reported by member Lastliberal above Grayson could not stand Lanza because of his obscene advances towards her off and sometimes on camera.  In addition, his gutter mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were intolerable.  After doing their second and last film together, Toast of New Orleans, the normally quiet Grayson stormed into Louie B.  Mayers office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with Lanza again  period.  Mayer felt that Grayson was much more valuable to MGM then Lanza, so Graysons statement stuck.  Grayson went profitable musicals Later in life when asked to compare Lanza and Keel her reply was that there was no comparison between them, and that Keel was great to work with and had much more appeal to the real people in the audiences.",

		"I really did not expect much from this film seeing as it has people from Parkersburg WV, which is were I live, acting in it.  This town is dull and so is this film.  I was crappy landmarks This movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there was not any.  Unless you are from Parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday, then stay away from this movie.  The dialog will put you to sleep, the acting will bore you to tears and Steven Soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this.  Its a predictable movie with no surprises.  What you see is what you get and that is a 73 minute tour of Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a narrator.",

I am from the area and I experienced the film as Just the way people in California think we are!  I have minimum wage We laughed a lot, we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age; the young people went out together at night.  The older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families.  The area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else.Aside from the if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed condescension, the story lacked any elements of charm, mystery or even a sense of dread.Marthas character was the worst drawn.  It is doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church, but if she had, she probably would have made friends there.  I have read reviews that seem to assume Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was younger, prettier and thinner but if this is the case it is not shown.  All we actually see is Martha learning to dislike Rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender.  We see Martha feeling left out during smoking sessions, left out of the loop when social plans are made, used but not appreciated, and finally disrespected and hurt.Just one more thing Are we supposed to suspect Kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks?  Please.  This takes stigma against mental illness to a new level.",

		"When thinking of the revelation that the main character in Bubble comes to at films end, I am reminded of last years Machinist with Christian Bale.  The only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters.An understated, yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life.  The title is cause for contemplation.  Perhaps, we, the audience are the ones in the Bubble as we are given no payoffs in the films slim 90 minute running time.  Audience reactions were often smug and judgmental, clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves.  people refer second term.It This film has it is merits, and is deserving of consideration for the things it does not say outright.",

The originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance, they were framed and paced better.  But the acting is fun and we get to see James Hong and other luminaries.The white boy intro was pointless.  I think the filmmakers did not know what to do with it, so they left it loosely structured and cut it down.  The father is an odd attempt at a Berkeley liberal  really, folks, everyone knows it is not groovy to live in the ghetto  but his segments are the most humorous.  They threw away some good opportunities.  Educated and embittered on the West Coast, a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in New York.  They are equally intolerable but always distinguishable.  That would have been interesting; this was not.The Hunters Point intro was the most disappointing.  It was the most derivative of the three, and stylistically the most distant from San Francisco.  You have seen it done before and you have seen it done better.  Even the video game was better!  Despite the generic nonlocality and aimless script, these characters have potential, the actors have talent, and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction... about ten minutes before the ending.

I have lived in SF my entire life, and folks here do not talk or act the way these actors did.  Everything was overdramatized, and the only cat I saw from the Bay was JT the Bigga Figga with his little cameo as a rapper.  No shock that he was the only one in the film who really dressed like cats out here ie his Warriors jersey.  Not once did I notice anyone wearing any Giants or 9ers gear; instead he fitted them in some cheesy madeup SF or Oakland jerseys that are not even sold around here.  HP has Asian gangbangers HP has Chinese gangster Further, while there now is a significant yuppie community that has invaded the Mission, all that was shown was some white dude and a selfproclaimed 100 West Coast Boriqua.  This is NOT New York!  Puerto Ricans here are few and far between, and the Latinos in the Mission are very, very different from the ONE that was shown here, who was without a doubt from NY.  Also, HP is not the only black neighborhood in the City.  An accurate depiction would have shown the drama between HP sets in their own hood as well as vs.  Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc.  This film could have been much better if Lee had done some more homework and had a better storyline to work with.",

I have instant he The voice is crap, the face is a bad ripoff of Legolas, the posture is horrible, and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them.  Said to say, I was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco, because I was hoping from then on it would be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only.  Too bad I was wrong.  These two and also LL Cool J give a very decent performance, and they are the main reason I give this a 4.  I see many upcoming movies with the little Timberlake cast... and cannot believe it.",

		"The championship game is only a couple of days away, but things in New Orleans are not as they should be.  From players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose, life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable, wonderful time.  Can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined?  Despite what you might think when you first read about Superdome, this is not a football movie.  In fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought.  Instead, Superdome is another of those lousy soap operaish 70s madeforTV movies populated with Hollywood has beens and those that never will be.  The cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good.  The best or worst example is Van Johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he is there.  The plot is dull, uninteresting, and unbelievable.  Donna Mills as a hitman?  Yeah, right!  It is about as believable as the affair she has with the liquor soaked David Jansen.  The movie also lacks any pace.  Trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow Superdome might have had.  With no drama or suspense in sight, Superdome ends up being a very poor example of a 70s madeforTV movie.  The lone highlight for me was the voiceover work from the late Charlie Jones  a sportscaster I miss listening to.  The eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and overhypes the atmosphere in New Orleans is pure cheese at its finest.Like most others who have seen Superdome, I also did so courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000.  it is early start So even though I have only rated Superdome a 210, I will give this episode a generous 35 on my MST3K rating scale.",
		"Comparison with American Graffiti is inevitable so save your money and time by renting that timeless classic.  Speaking of timeliness, there was an episode of Cheers where Norm and Cliff competed on who can find the most anachronism in a movie.  They would have loved this movie everything from some of the songs and some of the clothing were wrong.  There were sly reference such as they paved paradise to put up a parking lot.  The filmmakers hoped to elicit some smiles from us but basically made me groan.The characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially astute for teenagers.  they wrote darn movie Very little of what the characters said were believable.  Combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail.  Although, there were two exceptions Kelli Williams liven things up as the future flower child and, despite what another reviewer said, Rick Shroeder was quite good.  Showing that brooding characteristic that would come to full boil in his eventual appearance in N.Y.P.D.  Blues.",

I was appalled that Noah was involved in anything of the sort, especially his role.  Nobody with a fully functional brain would actually accept all that crap about the Vietnam War.  If anyone really wants to know how Communism was like, sit down and read a book on it.

		"No wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie.  It is just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch.  Bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a Disneyland attraction.  Students fistfight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue.  The Watts riots with a cast of...ugh...10??  he makes annoying smile Sardonicus.  Noah Wyle reads Bob Dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift.  Drunken virgin Rick Schroder sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service.  Silly, giggling school girls dress up in leopard stretch pants and walk on the set of Shindig, sing horribly off key, and actually make it big in the music business.  And who wrote this compelling dialog?  I am going to Burkley and wear flowers in my hair....I think I found someone to buy Sticks woody!.... These people are animals!  These people are my family!  as the Shirelles sing Mama Said.  Oh brother, What a mess.  This is like a Reefer Madness of the 60s except it is not even funny.",

		"MAJOR LEAGUE BACK TO THE MINORS 1998 ½ Starring Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Daggett, Written and directed by John Warren 100 minutes Rated PG13 for language and some violence By Blake French \tBelieve it or not, in the new John Warren comedy MAJOR LEAGUE BACK TO THE MINORS there is one funny scene.  It consists of a sequence where an infuriated coach throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him only to have it hit the cement and bounce back and smash him in the face.  It is not much, but with the exception of a few oneliners, it is all this film has to offer...enough said.  This movie is not only structurally impaired, characteristically undeveloped, predictable and badly written, but also just plain bad.

Last years we saw this same material in Air Bud Golden Receiver, and as bad as that film was, this is even worse.  At least Air Bud was family oriented.  Major League Back to the Minors is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a Sunday afternoon.  It is too childish for adults.  So who is this film for?  Teenagers?  Elderly?  People who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this?\t The film, like many others like this, has one basic point it tries to make teamwork conquers all.  Yes it does, and what a great moral to try to prove.

I cannot think of a more useless waste of money than this man shelling out for this pointless production.  It is fitting that he had such a useless role.There is very little poker in this movie.  Most of the time is spent on useless side characters whose plots are not resolved in the slightest.  Queen Momma does have a showstealing scene where she throws her loser boyfriend through a window and tries to shoot his brains out.  Also the nameless Arabs in the convenience store also give brilliant performances when they debate whether to beat up or kill an older lady who robs them.  Their subtle performances are easily among the films highlights.  It makes you wonder why they bothered getting all these white people to play the leads.In conclusion, complete nonsense.  Plan 9 from Outer Space has slightly more coherency.  If you play poker though you might want to have a laugh.  Also if you are Christian you might enjoy some of the heavyhanded religious conversation that pepper the movie like pointless pepper.  I hate movies made by religious people.  Especially ones who think they know something about things they know nothing about.  It is sad that Jennifer Harman and Scotty Nguyen got involved in this travesty as I cannot help but think less of them.  They must be envious of Johnny Chan for getting in Rounders.",

		"Murder By Numbers is one of those movies that you expect is madeforTV but is not.  Considering the only actor of any note is Bullock although Michael Pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things, it is not a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things.  Like... remembering to lock your front door when you go out.  you come personal issues Together with her new partner a wetlooking Ben Chaplin, she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman.  Nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they have planned and executed the perfect murder.  As the investigation continues, a battle of wills emerges between Cassie and the main suspect Richie Haywood Ryan Gosling.The crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless.  Bullock, though she is very nice to look at, is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as Rodney Dangerfield actually, he would be better!.  Chaplin, for his sins, is a complete nonentity and I feel sorry that he has to put this film on his CV in his attempt to break into Hollywood.  At least Gosling and Pitt, as the conniving sneering suspects, acquit themselves adequately.  As if dodgy leads were not bad enough, a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable but illogical ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run.Murder By Numbers has absolutely nothing going for it, even a pointless nude scene by Bullock would not redeem it.  Well, just a little but still not enough to save it.  Forgettable, predictable and redundant  this is one film that is not going to move the cop genre forward.  As Cassie probably says on her next case, there is nothing to see here people.  Move along, keep moving...",

Also, there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning  in other words  they had things within the movie that did not seem to fit the movie itself.  AND the title... no where in the movie does the title fit the movie...I suppose the title works for the previews....  Actors did well with what they had.....if they had a better director and writer, maybe this would have worked out better.  But it did not.  So now there is a new terrible movie coming out this Friday....  My opinion!.... do not waste your time or money.",
		"So, I am wondering while watching this film, did the producers of this movie get to save money on Sandra Bullocks wardrobe by dragging out her before clothes from Miss Congeniality?  Did Ms.  Bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the before Gracie Hart?  As many reviewers have noted before, the film is very formulaic.  Add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest.The two bad boy serial killers have been done before and better in other films.  As has the good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence character been seen before.  In fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes.One last peeve  using the term serial killer is false advertising.  it is premeditated murder You may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer.",

The whole thing is pretty much blown by the cop side of the story, where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplins homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on.  Although Bullock is strong in her role, it is not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing.  he did small you Anyway, the plot really is not even a factor in this movie at all.  The two teen killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie.  Their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well.  It is too bad they were not in a much better allaround film.  Barbet Schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker.

		"Hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once did the majestic and very funny Maitresse 1976, and now only seems to do by the numbers Hollywood thrillers.This is very lightweight John Grisham material, crossed with the plot of a TV movie.  Bullock is serial killers Ben Chaplin is her reserved police partner Sam Kennedy, and together they make an uncomfortable duo.  Not good, when two unbalanced college maladriots Gosling and Pitt decide to send them on a wild goose chase  by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene.Fair enough, but while Bullock and Chaplin fail to create any sparks, we also have to endure a several dull overlymelodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in Casss history.  Then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliffside log cabin where there is absolutely no doubt the OTT ending will be set.  Oooh... the atmosphere.Watch any episode of CSI instead.  It is to the point and far more exciting.",
		"Except for acknowledging some nice cinematography, I can hardly say anything positive about this movie.  The single real issue is the protagonists dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life.  Abundant emotionally powerful scenes do not go with this plot and, because of bad acting, they also fail to create the intended atmosphere.  The director only manages to introduce Anthonys dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution.  The characters do not seem to evolve, although it is difficult to speak of any characters... perhaps except for Sonny.  Beside him, actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to, they come off as selfindulging amateurs.  I wonder bad acting",

		"They must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the Hollywood bus station.  They then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived.  You know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot, four young boys playing in grainy slow motion, accompanied by voice over narration.  Next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion.  Once they are grown, it is easy to spot the writerdirector among the four.  He is the quiet, contemplative, longhaired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants.  This means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from Hickville to Hollywood.  Only there is no writing, or directing talent on display here.  And if you still cannot figure out which one he is, heres a hint The auteur and his character have the same middle name.  It took over an hour to figure out that these twentysomething men were supposed to still be in high school.  What looked like a prison was apparently a high school, the warden turned out to be the principal.  Once more, the poor, misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement, murder and pillage, but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father.  How about hitting back, kid, like you do everyone else?  Numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose.  Howlingly bad dialogue.  Many scenes badly out of focus.  Cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras, drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience.  Overacting in the extreme.  And if you do not quite get the selfimportant speeches, or the slowmotion scenes, just listen to the overbearing music.

		"I feel bad review But after sitting through 96 minutes of it, I feel I have to do so.  Where the heck is the plot in this film?!  I must have missed it, I was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened.  Sure the ending was somewhat shocking but they did not build up to it.  I forgot who was who half of the time, so they did not really develop the characters.  The acting was soso, most of the time it was believable, but I was able to see through it most of the time.  So... without giving anything away, I must say that unless you like the actors in the film, there is no real reason to watch this movie.  I could be mistaken, but I just did not understand why there was so little, or too much of the film.  I cannot decide which one that would be, so I say judge for yourselves.

		"Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good together in THE MUMMYS HAND, return for this very minor Universal Horror offering.  But this time, instead of having Wallace Ford as the comedic sidekick Babe, we get Fuzzy Knight substituting as a silly buddy named Stuff.  But the results are nowhere near as charming, and the scare level is virtually nil.Dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle.  Peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride.  But there is a tall and skinny John Carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as The Phantom who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himself.This phantom is not very mysterious, and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness.  It is perky Moran It is forgettable misfires",
		"A horribly pointless and, worse, boring film.  Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes, and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way.  Will Ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to Jim Careys Truman Show, and substitutes his usual shouting routine admittedly very funny if you discount Talledega Nights for, well, pretty much nothing.  Emma Thompson is no more than mildly irritating that some reviews I have read here are talking her up for an Oscar nomination is laughable whilst Maggie Gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of Harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy.

		"Spoilers containedI would heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific.  What I did not expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go.  What starts off as a typical cowboyindian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic comedy about Honus Soldier Blue of the title played by Peter Strauss and Cresta Candice Bergen who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the Cheyenne.  The majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit.  Donald Pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason.  They then escape and both turn up separately at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base.  As Cresta used to be married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them.  So far so ordinary.  Then comes the ending.  After enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will theywill not they get together storyline, the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head.  Similarities can be drawn with the Wild Bunch at this point of the film but the Wild Bunch kept the same tone throughout and did not resort to extreme gratuitous violence.  In some ways, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perrys Last Summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending.  I did not hate Soldier Blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending.  you want disturbing slaughter",
		"Soldier Blue is a movie with pretensions pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on mans inhumanity to man, on the white mans exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples; a biting, unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of Vietnam.  Well, sorry, but it fails miserably to be any of those things.  it appears different movies What it is basically is a lame, clich?d, poorly acted odd couple romance  Strauss and Bergen overcoming their prejudices about the others lifestyle and falling in love ah, bless  bookended by two sickening massacres which would not have been out of place in a Lucio Fulci splatter flick.There is no excuse for the repulsive, prurient, goredrenched climax, in which cute little native American children are variously shot, sliced, dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic closeup, and largebreasted native American women are molested, raped and strung up  no excuse, that is, except box office.  The massacre itself, whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention, is very badly staged and shot; a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them, intercut with a few specialeffects sequences of beheadingdismemberment  dismemberments, incidentally, which utilised real amputees in their filming.  Now that is what I call exploitation.Forget all the pap you have heard including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie about this being a protest, an indictment of American brutality towards the native peoples.  This film does not give a stuff about the plight of the Cheyenne; had it done so it would have featured some involving native American characters, would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless, faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax.  Instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of Bergen and Strauss lousy actors both, in this at least, with plenty of blood, guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious.Which is a terrible shame, because there is a movie to be made about the Sand Creek massacre, about all of the real life massacres the US and Britain, and all socalled civilised nations have participated in over the centuries Iraq?.  this just is not that movie.",

		"First of all, this film can be divided into three segments.  A promising opening, with the ambushing of some cavalry by the Cheyenne.  This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section, with the totally miscast Candice Bergen and Soldier Blue traveling together to reach the safety of an Army garrison.  Miss Bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth, and looks like she just walked out of a 1970s Jack Nicholson movie.  I mean she maintains zero interest, with zero believability.  The third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an Indian village.  This is so obviously overdone to lay on the antiwar propaganda, that it comes across as simply long, outrageous, and contrived.  Not recommended.   MERK................................

		"it did actual depth Also on board the wagon she is traveling in is a shipment of government gold, cash the Cheyenne need to buy guns with, so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and Cresta flees to the hills, accompanied by Honus Gant Peter Strauss, the lone surviving cavalryman.  Calling Gant by the snarky nickname Soldier Blue, Cresta demonstrates that her years among the savages was time well spent, outstripping Gant in survival skills, common sense, and sheer balls, and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements, a band of hostile Kiowa, an unscrupulous trader  played by Donald Pleasance, here giving one of his most ridiculous performances, and that is saying something  and, in the tradition of many previous westernset romantic comedies, each other.During the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably  and predictably  attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on  while Gant has a freshly treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg, no less  in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that was not filled with rattlesnakes, mountain lions, or who knows what, to say nothing of the Cheyenne, who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment there I go, thinking in NYC real estate terms again.  Realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave, Cresta leaves Gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge will not spare a couple of men so they can rescue Gant; the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby Cheyenne village, and once Cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubbytobe and makes a beeline straight to the Cheyenne to warn them of what is coming.  What happens next is what gained the film its infamy; it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a leadin to a hideous reenactment of the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre, an orgy of rape, torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of keeping the country clean, and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty.  Children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets, unarmed people are beheaded  a nice effect, I have to admit  women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes, then raped and mutilated  in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight, so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts, which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act  and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered, their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs.  No joke, this scene would instantly garner an NC17 rating if released today, to say nothing of possibly spurring Native American interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted.I am all in favor of westerns that do not shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won, or stolen if truth be told, but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be; one minute it is a heavyhanded pseudohippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up well, DUH! , then it is a lighthearted battle of the sexes farce wherein Cresta proves herself five times the man Gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho with no undies, but that all goes out the window when Donald Pleasance shows up with an unintentionally ?  hilarious pair of bucktoothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a subplot that goes nowhere, all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax.  Any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film, but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the films promotion and poster imagery.  But by trying to be all things to all audiences, SOLDIER BLUE ends up as an incoherent, preachy Mulligan stew of presumably wellintentioned political correctness, but if they were going to tell the story of the Sand Creek Massacre, would not it have been a good idea to have some Indian characters who were more than just walkons with Murphy Brown acting as their mouthpiece?  We get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing the most savage film in history.

		"When Sam Peckinpahs superlative THE WILD BUNCH 1969 opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultraviolence, it did so with a talented if whiskymarinated hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth, but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by Peckinpahs epic, and SOLDIER BLUE definitely falls into that category.SOLDIER BLEW, er, BLUE tells the story of foulmouthed New Yorker Cresta Lee Candice Bergen a blonde protohippie chick who is been rescued from two years of captivity among the Cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she will be reunited with the fianc?e she only wants to marry for his money.

		"I have recent days The first was Charles Laughtons Rembrandt.  It was so lousy that I shut it off.  This one I am afraid is not very much better.Flora Robson is as ugly as ever as Queen Elizabeth.  Perhaps, her performance as the virgin Queen was good for 1937 standards but when you compare it to that of a Helen Mirren, it is absolutely no match.  In robotic fashion, Robson states her lines.  Her battle message to the English troops is so lackluster in spirit.Even a dashing Laurence Olivier cannot save this utter piece of boredom.Future wife Vivien Leigh is in a supporting role here and she does not really convey anything here.  To think, that Scarlett was 2 years later! It is a shame that history with the Spanish Armada is made out to be so boring in this film.",

		"I remembered the title so well.  To me, it was a Flora Robson movie with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting roles.  And it had Vincent Masseys voice from behind whiskers.  Well Flora Robson was great.  Her next signature, for me, would be 55 Days at Peking.  The same role but with different sumptuous gowns.  And the same voice.  As for the Armada, it was a subtext.  I like blackandwhite films Was everything done in Elizbethan times at night?  It was talky and difficult to fathom, at times.  I could not tell which was the love interest.  Was it the Spaniard or was it Vivien Leigh?  And I do not believe that Elizabeth I would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the Armada.  Apparently it worked for the Empire, but not for the script.  This might have been more accurate, historically, but Bette Davis had more engaging scripts.  And I missed daylight!",

I disliked this movie.  To be more specific, I disliked the concept of this movie.  The cinematography was good.  The mood was nice.  And the acting was satisfactory.  However, the story is fatuous, unacurate and misleading.  It is personal level First of all, he is a black guy.  And this is not a racist remark, I swear.  The thought of a White, Hispanic or even Native American swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents.  The katana represents the soul of a Samurai, imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the Samurai.  For Ghost Dog to use his guns instead of the Katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside, and where the heck did he get a Katana anyway?  It must be one of those replicas, which insults the Samurai caste even more.Also, Ghost Dog showed no honor.  Near the end of the movie, he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain.  Not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy, it is more like a ninjas way; silent assassins; a group that samurais deny exists, but hates nonetheless.Then he tries to kill his boss, when he finds out his boss is a baddie.  You know what a true Samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable?  He kills himself, to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master.Everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all Samurai adhere to Bushido.So, we have great cinematography, good ambiance and soso acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise, which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it , making it an unsatisfactory overall film, and an insult to everything a honorable bushisamurai holds dear. 2.510 Bleah",

This was a huge disappointment considering the great cast, not just Marilyn.The story was just nothing, certainly nothing like described on the VHS box, of course.  There simply was no suspense, precious little excitement and too many dull spots, most of them trying to show why Nellie Monroe was so messed up.  This was not a good role for Monroe, even though I did not need to see this character to know she could act.  Some Like It Hot alone was good enough evidence for me.  it was popular films.It it is popular films.It Summary it is not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.",

The only reason you would root for her is because you want to see Madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the films end.

Like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail.Finally, neither of the leads is convincing in their roles.  Madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky.  Fleming flips fiery tomboy The only reason you would root for her is because you want to see Madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the films end.  The way that Madison tames Fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blowup dolls.  Even if you do see them as dolls, the total lack of suspense will bore you.Total waste of time.  Even the scenerys kinda dull.  Give this one a big miss.",
		"This is a wellworn story about a man who marries to escape the hangmans noose, then sets about taming his reluctant bride.  It manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time.  We never find out, for example, why a woman who won the respect of an Indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband.  Or why the members of her team are so eager to get a real man in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own.  This only made sense in fifties Hollywood.There is a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whipthe second timethen yanks her off her horse.  Never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye, which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip!  Then, he prevails in a fight against her Indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp.  That is some second wind.  Later, he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty Indians as they all are in these flicks after they reject her now she is his squaw.  Never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and she is been negotiating with them for years.  And the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on himyeah, right.  Like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail.Finally, neither of the leads is convincing in their roles.  Madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky.  Fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot, but is totally unconvincing as a fiery tomboy.  Madison get runaway horse you want runaway horse The way that Madison tames Fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blowup dolls.  Even if you do see them as dolls, the total lack of suspense will bore you.Total waste of time.  Even the scenerys kinda dull.  Give this one a big miss.",
		"To be honest i had heard this was pretty bad before i decided to watch it, but i am never one to let others influence my viewings, in fact i am more likely to watch something out of defiance!.  Bullwhip had gorgeous eyes The picture is not very good, and is in fact very morally dubious, all the characters are corrupt and shifty in one way shape or form, all motivated by greed or egocentric victories, this is all well and good if the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a taut climax shuddering picture.  Sadly it does not, and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you cannot help shouting out that you have been cheated into watching a pretty bad film, nobody in the cast come out with any credit, with lead man Guy Madison painfully wooden in the extreme.Not even the lovely Rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone, 310",

		"I saw last night I am last night I do not think I will be watching again.  The acting was totally wooden, the plot completely predictable, the ending totally unrealistic  I mean who would believe a 30 million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer?  The lead actor Victor Garber seemed so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his role  perhaps he realized how bad the writing was!!  I fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor, but they can surely find better writers.  Maybe they are outsourcing the writing to India or China!!  I will bet we will not be seeing this one next season!",

		"Frankly I am rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to Steven Smith I wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering.  Have they all been written by his pals?  The action clunks along, the music is irritating and over used, the script is simply dire and the actors with the exception of the gardener mediocre at best.  I do young filmmaker I do same actors Yes, it is his first film, low budget etc.   I get it, but it is also out there for members of the public to purchase and it is just not up to scratch.",
		"it is good feel It is sound design There is continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout.  And finally last but not least the acting is appalling.  For a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this.",
		"I will keep this short; thanks to Greg for helping me to put this succinctly Captivity is about a guy who drugs a girls drink, imprisons and tortures her, then poses as a captive to have sex with her.  That is the single twist and punchline of the film.  It is slow motion And, it is not even a good movie.  It is not so bad it is good; it is just bad.It should also be mentioned that among critics, there is a spoiler code that they dare not break, even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile.  Why NO ONE had the cojones to step up and say, this is garbage, and this is why, is beyond me.Do not give your money to these pooppeddlers.",

		"The only reason I give it a 2 is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment on.This film is asinine.  It is 21st century The gore is gratuitous and simply revolting.  I did not care about any of the characters, but I did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap I would complain about the money I spent, but my date and I wisely left after 40 minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining Live Free or Die Hard, which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because I endured the utter poop of Captivity for 40 minutes.",

		"Absolutely fantastic.  Now, before a legion of cinema purists choke on their latt?s, allow me to elaborate.  I have impressive claim I remember big screen The two leads Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst.  Of course, they were not helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne  Celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the OJ defence.  The plot to stretch the term slightly was thin to nonexistent and the gore scenes, whilst undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and laughably formulaic.  What plot there is revolves around a twentysomething model Cuthbert who is abducted, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical.  The torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience.  Whilst there really are very, very few positives to draw from this film, its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film.  I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema.  Within twenty minutes, the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout.  For my part I came out flushed with laughter, buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling filmmaking.  Whichever way you look at it, this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film.P.S.  I omitted to mention that I managed to get in to the film free...so I can afford to laugh about it.  I was still tempted to ask for my money back...it really was THAT bad.",

		"The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor, a holocaust survivor, part of Mengeles experiments on twins, consisting primarily her version of what happened at Auschwitz, and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments.  The movie obviously had great reviews.  It is large part One of the user reviews on IMDb by Eric Monder obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum could only find the sweetest nectar.  In one of the many dramatic sequences, as a group of Jews argue with Kor at a Jewish center, the meaning of the word forgive is even debated, but the isolated and outnumbered Kor holds her own But by this time, the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that I could see clearly once more.  After the strongwilled Eva Kor forgives her Nazi captors the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about, at least from the viewpoint of Kor.  The movie goes about following her, past her public statement forgiving the Nazis and into new territory.  To me, this was the meat of the movie, surrounded by inedible fat of her act of forgiveness.  Obviously, it was a very sick cow.On a mission to test her theory of forgiveness, in order to heal wounds of the past, she makes her way to the promised land to meet with some Arabs, to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with Jews in the US on her act of forgiving the Nazis, including one at a Jewish center in Chicago.  From then on, anyone not so teary eyed that they cannot see the screen will find it hardpressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements.Firstly, you immediately notice her body language, defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of Arab scholars and teachers.  Her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time, effort and money the entire act was.  A rather annoyed Dr Sami Advan Professor of education at Bethlehem University gets it just right when he tells Kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment.Finally, the debate at the Jewish center in Chicago, where she is grilled on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so, in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts.I will cut to the chase.  By the end of the movie, I was hoping I had not chosen to watch the movie.  The movie was badly made, failing to delve deeper into anything about Auschwitz apart from the purely trivial, just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears.  It showed that Kor, the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion.  Her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness at best to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate.Lastly, is everyone so retarded today that they cannot notice the difference between making peace and forgiving?  Quoting another IMDb user, I do not see her forgiveness as being weak quite the contrary, she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul, she wanted the suffering to be over, so she let it go.  That would be the perfect laymans definition of MAKING PEACE.I guess, in a world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness, there is no room to question those that have gone through more than the human mind can fathom.P.S.  The dictionary certainly should go into all those Bookstobuy lists everyone keeps making.",

Quoting another IMDb user, I do not see her forgiveness as being weak quite the contrary, she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul, she wanted the suffering to be over, so she let it go.  That would be the perfect laymans definition of MAKING PEACE.I guess, in a world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness, there is no room to question those that have gone through more than the human mind can fathom.P.S.  The dictionary certainly should go into all those Bookstobuy lists everyone keeps making.",
		"This movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning, but never fleshed out to it is expectations.  The director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas typical of the Asian directors, but does not know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it.  The story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film, never finding a solid, explainable, interesting angle.  Basically, the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases.  The acting was very good, however.  All the actors gave good performances, and Jude Law was outstanding as he is always is.  he chose weak film It is bad he",
		"LL Cool J performed much better in this movie that I expected!  He did renegade cop From the very beginning, he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he is in.  He acts as a sort of gentle giant  a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody, yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start  and he does an amazing job.  He was quite clearly the best character in the movie.This was certainly a performance that will not win Morgan Freeman any awards.  After starring in powerhouse films like the Shawshank Redemption this film was certainly a step down.  His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor  and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner.  There are so many ways his character Moses Ashford could have taken a more pivotal role.  That he did not was disappointing and a true letdown.  I was hoping to see more from him in this film.Timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry.  His portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive.  This movie is a typical action movie that at least initially bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs LA has experienced in the past.  Being an action movie, it has its share of shootemup scenes, blood, and guts.  These scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable.  Watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end  think of what you would typically expect in a goodcopsbadcops conflict  and it bears little resemblance to a REAL police shootout.What irked me most was the way Timberlakes character behaved during shootout scenes.  He starts out having guns and not using them.  Then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he is been firing a gun his whole life.  Then he runs out of bullets and does not have a gun  and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything  suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns AND extra ammo?!  Little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me.If what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay, then you will probably love this movie.  Personally, it does not matter to me what KIND of movie it is as long as it is realistic.  Make me believe that the story is true.  This story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that I came away feeling unsatisfied.",

		"I love all types of films, especially horror.  That being said, Survival does not live up to ANY of the hype surrounding it.I cannot give it any points on originality.  There is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes, or remaking what others have done.  It has crazy family On those lines I have to compare it with the likes of Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn though the twist in that one is obvious, and others.  Survival falls up way short against comparable films.  The plot was just not original in ANY way.  Some films can get by with a weak and way overdone plot with superb acting, special fx, or a slew of other factors.  Survivial does not have any of that to bank on.  If you will, note the following The acting in the movie never took off.  I do not knock or blame the actors for that, nor the director.  The dialogue was at best mediocre, and the actors involved never showed not saying did not HAVE the talent to pull it off.  I mention 2 standouts.  The leading man in this film certainly has the look, but I seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film.  The actor who portrayed Greg also had potential, but we never got to see any of it watch the movie to see why, you will not believe it...The grainy film look.  Ah yes, that little tidbit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of Grindhouse films.  In todays film making, that has become a gimmick.  It either works or it does not.  In this case it just does not work.  There are too many other flaws going on, so it winds up distracting from the film, not adding to it.  That being said, I think they did a good job of adding that grain.  That is some good, quality grain.  I think with a different script, better direction, and possibly actors, they should try another Grindhouse attempt.  They will probably pull it off.As far as the tech aspects, in my opinion, they never quite gelled for me either.  Better care could have been taken with audio sounds like it was fed directly into the camera, but there is nothing wrong with that and for being shot on DV, it was too soft for my taste.That is all I have to say about that.....",

		"This movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together.  it was white guys it looks white guys It is almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves.  The movie has no plot.  It simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath.  There are some funny scenes and comedic bits.  But they do not redeem the flat monotony.The graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do, and not done very well at that.  Anything that cannot be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation.I went to see this film after seeing the trailer, which makes it look like a Tarrentino piece.  Well, the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get.  Ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane, inane comedy.  It works at times, but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over.  It is more like a string of Satuday Night Live skits than a movie.  It is a hityouovertheheadwithit kind of comedy.  I can see where the story idea is intriguing.  But, in this film post apocalyptic America is much like Medevil England.  In fact Wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era.  He plans to make a Part 2.  I guess he thinks he is Tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing.At the opening in LA, Wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2.

		"This is the biggest pile of crap I have ever watched.  DO NOT RENT!  The makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie.  It starts with some what of a plot, then fades fast to nothing.  I think I would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover.  The actors were awful, the plot faded fast, filming left to much work to be done.  Not one good thing to say about this crap movie.  If you rent this movie you will waste your money.  I really enjoy National Lampoon movies, but this was a waste of time.  Learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce, and learn to direct.  I feel rental cost",

It had wooden acting But that was at the end!  The rest of it I had to wait and hope that something meaningfull would happen but it did not.  This movie is about a couple that tries to find out the changes going on in the world like places in China where there was an earthquake and end up at a convent run by eight nuns and a priest.  The convent end up being the key to the misshappenings.  The whole movie is missleading and boring.  One of Lees worst.",

So they leave and go to the party !?!.  Moments later he finds out that China has suffered a major earthquake.  From there, the movie goes... nowhere!  Yes, Christopher Lee is in it, but that really does not help much.  Besides, Lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in Howling II.

She hangs out they are on their way to a dinner while he discovers a message from space Major Earth Disruption, repeated over and over.  He says something about it being the first message from space he is ever been able to decipher; his wife tells him they are going to be late for the dinner party.  So they leave and go to the party !?!.  Moments later he finds out that China has suffered a major earthquake.  From there, the movie goes... nowhere!  Yes, Christopher Lee is in it, but that really does not help much.  Besides, Lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in Howling II.  it has stupid elements Plus, there is lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed.",

		"SpoilersWow, END OF THE WORLD is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience.Here is the full story a scientist is getting messages from space a la INDEPENDENCE DAY.  The messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in China.  He starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so he is trying to figure out who is receiving the messages and who is also sending out messages in space.  He and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent.  They visit it.  Everything looks bored Christopher But the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent.  So he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens, disguised as priests and nuns.  They are held against their will and the alien played by Lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet.  Once the alien get the special element, the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform.  Lee, being the last alien left, tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens.  Lee walks in the transporter and he is gone.  The couple, looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world, decide to follow the aliens.  Because earth is doomed, the couple does not see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear.  The last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding.  The end.That is it.  I have never seen such a dull movie in my life.  It is the most underwhelming movie I have ever experienced.  The scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen.  They do not care about anything.  They see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide what the heck, who needs earth anyway?  They do not even try to stop them or do something to make things better.  This kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent.  The actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces, so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work.  I was not expecting much with this movie because it IS a Charles Band production, but I did not expect it to be this bad.Christopher Lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned STARSHIP INVASIONS.  Well, I am sorry Chris but STARSHIP INVASIONS was actually goofy fun.  STARSHIP INVASIONS is terrible but terribly entertaining.  END OF THE WORLD is MUCH, MUCH, MUCH worst it is beyond dull and inert, with NO entertainment value whatsoever.",

		"The Earth is destined to be no more thanks to Father Pergado and a bunch of Nuns.  he was great actors The cast are not too bad, though most have now retired from acting.  The film has terrible sound effects mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems and it ridiculously pondering at times  showing a scene of the sky, for instance, for what feels like hours at a time.  Despite this the story is pretty humorous in a worldisdoomed sort of way and the production is adequate.  Interestingly one scene features Albert Band and wife Jackie; Meda Band; Writer Frank Ray Perilli and Charles Bands assistant Bennah Burton.  Despite its plodding nature I genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it.",

The New York City location scenes are the main attraction, after all these years.  The panning of the prisoners behind bars is memorable, because nothing else seems able to make the cameras move.

		"Wow.  I have pivotal role I do pivotal role Justin Timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that Edison had.His acting was PAINFUL to observe.  The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even LL Cool J was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on.  How the director and movie company figured that Timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend.His character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass, and he is supposed to be the hero...  I would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video.  MAYBE if you have HBO and have NOTHING else to do at 2am on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, this may be OK.Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human Kermit the Frog act in a Hollywood Blockbuster, just did not work at all.",

		"This movie had to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen.  The acting was terrible, Horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot!  I will never watch this movie again nor will I recommend this movie to anyone.  What a waste of time!  First, as soon as the movie began I realized what I got myself into.  All they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie.  The prank phone calls, halloween night, a psycho, and one knife!  Its absolutely ridiculous.  I was not scared at all during the movie, which I thought horror movies were supposed to do.  As for the making of the movie, its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary.  I mean Scary Movie At least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie.",

Let us put in something else.  us smile little bit But come ON, at least get some decent actors!  Every once in a while in a movie, if the acting is bad and the movie is not going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting, I can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they are overor underdoing their lines.  But I can only take so much.  Crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter, there was no delivery for their lines... amateur does not even come close to the acting in this film.Anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some REALLY good drugs while they were watching the movie.  It is the most pointless thing I have ever had the displeasure of watching.  DO NOT WATCH OR BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!",

		"When it comes to horror movies, I am more than willing to suspend disbelief, ignore subpar production values, and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare.  This movies simply has no good scares to offer.  It cannot even be enjoyed as camp.  Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad direction, the kills were predictable and poorly staged, the music was annoying, the camera work was wretched, even the costumes were bad.  I felt obvious lack I doubt they got any rehearsal, either.  It is embarrassing to watch, and so boring than making it through to the contrived surprise ending requires tremendous endurance.  It is quite easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen.I do not normally write reviews, but this one was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others.  This movie is a complete waste of time.  If you must watch this movie, do not miss the Making offeaturette.  The writerdirector seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold, daring move.  Seen it.  He and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it is a newage Citizen Kane.  It is like listening to a group of thirdgraders take you behind the scenes of their Christmas pageant.  They truly think they have created something of substance.  It is sad, really The only reason I gave this movie a 2 is because I think 1 should be reserved for true atrocities, like Manos Hands of Fate and Space Mutiny.  So American Nightmare is not the WORST movie I have ever seen, but I would have to say that it is somewhere in the bottom fifty.",

		"The premise is amazing and the some of the acting, notably Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, is charming... but this film is near unwatchable.  it comes free online Most of the singing is offkey.  I think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it...  The dialogue is really stupid and trite.  The movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical subplots.  I found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering when is it ever going to end.",

Someone needs to refund the 4.95 I spent at Blockbuster to rent this homemade mess.  it is complete waste What I do not get is why did this get distributed in the first place???... somebody MUST have been doing some heavy drugs the night that deal was made.  I have seen better films come out of film schools and I have been to film school so I can say that as a fact.  The quality of this work is also just SO VERY bad to view...shot on DV???  Nuff said.  The songs are not songs but just banter that sounds the same in every section.  Want to see a good musical?  THEN Do not RENT THIS MOVIE.",
		"This movie was so terrible it was almost good... almost.  We love musicals, but not this one.  Even with the terrible sound quality, poor cinematography, and many actors who cannot sing or dance, Anthony Rapp actually managed to give a good performance especially toward the end.  The character Marjorie, a drunk lady, was enjoyable to watch, too.  The plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music.  Admittadly, some of the songs fantabulous are pretty catchy but not in a good way.Open House is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful!  We think excellent actors",
		"Normally, I have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but I was so disappointed with this movie that I spent an hour registering with IMDb just to get it off my chest.You would think a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a bankable bet... well, this movie was just terrible.  It is nigh on impossible to suspend disbelief; I tried, really, I wanted to enjoy it but Justin Timberlake just would not let me.  Timberlake should stick to music, what a dreadful performance  NO presence as an actor,NO character.  Cannot blame everything on Justin The movie also boast a dreadful plot  badly timed editing; its definitely an F.After seeing this, I have to wonder what really motivates actors.  I mean, surely Morgan actually read the script before taking the part.  Did he not see how poor it was?  What then could motivate him to take the part?  Money?  Of course, acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work.  he gets poor script Meanwhile, the audience goes What the hell is going on here?  You expect me to believe this crap? In short, apart from Justin a great lineup badly executed  very disappointing.",

I kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that Carly Pope could play the lead in this movie!  The woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance.  Baransky was whole thing Probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with.  Maybe I am expecting too much for a Lifetime movie played 15 days from Christmas but I sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting JJ with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie.",

JJ, aghast at this turn of events, then blackmails restaurant owner, Alex, to entertain her mother in exchange for maybe reviewing his dying restaurant.  Alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother.  There are numerous problems with this movie, the characters are universally 2dimensional.  JJ is hateful character JJs colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic.  The underlying message of an over50 woman unable to make it on her own, without male assistance is bad, bad, BAD.  The acting is uniformly dull, the script uninspired.  The films only saving grace is the setting of New York City.  I would so NOT recommend this film.",

Apparently the writers of tripe like this do not understand that it is NOT the common thing for PARENTS to act like children, and then be treated AS children by THEIR children.  That is just more of the societal baloney that Hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we, their public, were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings.This is a sad movie with a stupid ending.

The opportunist young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive, physically.There was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter who was an uptight, selfish, selfcentered btch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect to the mother  a woman who was kindhearted, sweettempered, humorous, and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend.  Of course the mother had her own flaws... she had reacted to her husbands demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter.Regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed, this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually LIKE baloney.

The daughter is not believable in her job role ... she gets a promotion she does not deserve a great opportunity and drops that ball too, but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver, the writers shoot her down as an opportunist, when she was just doing what any careeroriented person would do  taking advantage of a wideopen opportunity created by the lack of selfdiscipline of her coworker, a girl who apparently does not understand the concept of honoring her promises to her boss, in this case.The daughter grudgingly allows her mother to stay with her, on a temporary basis, but then treats her mother the woman who gave her Life and raised her to adulthood like a pariah.  Apparently the writers of tripe like this do not understand that it is NOT the common thing for PARENTS to act like children, and then be treated AS children by THEIR children.  Hollywood keeps stupid ending If the young male restauranteur had been real and not a twodimensional tv character, he would have stayed with the MOTHER, who was not that much older than him and quite attractive.  But in the end he falls for the daughter, a shallow, rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth, but in an ordinary, bland way.  The opportunist young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive, physically.There was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter who was an uptight, selfish, selfcentered btch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect to the mother  a woman who was kindhearted, sweettempered, humorous, and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend.  Of course the mother had her own flaws... she had reacted to her husbands demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter.Regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed, this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually LIKE baloney.  Where is the mustard?",
		"I hate to sound like an old person, but frankly I have not seen too many movies that I like that were made after 1960... generally, movies just seem to get worse and worse although I quite enjoyed the Scott Baio vehicle The Bread, My Sweet, except for the de rigeur sex scene which added NOTHING of value to THAT movie.

		"Having seen men Behind the Sun I guess I hoped for an evolution in style  technique to match the larger scale of this movie.  someone make Japanese atrocities I was Japanese atrocities I was Japanese atrocities This plays like a bottomtomid tier European Nazi exploitation movie from the 70s  e.g.  SS Experiment Camp etc perhaps more like Deported Women of the Special Section actually.  Granted it has a greater scope and more people running around, but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lots of hapless nonactors limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots, spiced up with the occasional poorly executed shock sequence.  The admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power.  Watch channel 4s The Holocaust aired recently still running? , as of 1 No 2006 for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the evils of war featuring excellent incontext use of actual footage.  This is the type of treatment the horror of Nanjing deserves, not this hackneyed exploitation garbage a better executed exploitation movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine, but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie.

Looking back, I guess I could call it a loselose situation.  On one hand, I still do not get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called Please Do not Eat The Babies, and on the other hand, Island Fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful, pointless, boring, unwatchable piece of garbage.  Yeah, definitely loselose.I am not even sure what genre they are going for here.  Just early 80s badness, with a flashback that might actually be longer than the nonflashback.  First up, two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys, once caught, the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string, around her neck, and somehow, these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere.  And this is where things start to get weird, somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island, years earlier, when they were only 10.  I guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is.  So, now, we are in the past, while the girls try to retrace their steps, so these bad guys do not kill them, although, I would not have minded if they had.  In the flashback, the 10 year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends, eventually stopping by an island for some air, they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents.  Any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up, but the flashback was undeniably better than the present, which, still, is not saying much.For a while there I had forgotten about the original story, At one point, I Ithought maybe the director had too, and when the flashback ended, that would be the end, which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a halfhour shorter.  This pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end, and real stuff does happen, but it is stupid.  I guess I did not exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured, or anything like that, but I did expect some form of outlandish Bentertainment, mostly just a confusing, inept storyline, unsure of its genre.  My advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like Attack Of The Beast Creatures.

		"Roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on.  All that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family.This one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that I started feeling bad for poor Hank Worden who truly deserved much MUCH better.  I did same DVD The DVD also comes with 1978s Barracuda",
		"This is available on a Drive In Double Feature from Dark Sky Films, and since I just had finished up Barracuda, I watched this too.  This is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time.We begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town, but where exactly are they?  They stop Chinese vendor They stop Aztec dancers And all the while, these girls are being followed by two guys, who eventually drop whatever stealth they did not have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town, and they finally catch them.It seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck, and these guys want to find the loot, and where did she get it?  So, in flashback, we go back to find out.  And how did they know she had this coin?  Hard to say, really.Now, back in the day, when these two women were 10 years old, they were out with their sisters and their sisters boyfriends on a boat, and after stopped to get air in their tanks, they tow this young boy back to his home dock, only to have his grandpa come out  invite the young uns up for herbal tea with granny.  But not everyone has the tea, Todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls, and then when they are away from it, the boat blows up, and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared.  Well, it seems as though these kindly folk raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell, and serve it herbal tea.But the girls and Todd did leave the island, but now, they are returning, escorted by their captors, and they are there to find the treasure, despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was BEFORE.  There also seems to be someone else on the island, and the thugs mysteriously begin to die, one by one, and since there is only three, it does not take long.  And there is even a sort of happy ending, which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film.The two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues, and combined with no acting ability they are borderline hilarious.  The hillbillytype family is also devoid of acting ability, despite the fact that the grandpa is Hank Worden, who appeared in many films and TV shows.  The action is confusing, the locales are even more confusing, and the island looks like Southern California.So what the hell IS this?  I am not sure, but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think or say, huh?  4 out of 10, very bizarre.",

		"I do last time I got so emotional I wanted to scream in anguish, destroy the screen, readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism.  Timberlake is horribly miscast; in fact, casting him is like casting Andy Dick to play the lead role in Patton, or Nathan Lane to play Jesus.  But that is almost beside the point.Timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role.  I used to have problems with Ben Afflecks acting talent, but Timberlake makes Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench.  With his metrosexual lisp read lithp, his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like The 25 Clich? Expressions for Actors, he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly, and no matter how you slice it, I do not and will not buy his role as an amateurturnedcrusaderforjustice journalist.  It simply will not fly.However, Timberlake alone is not to blame for his failure.  Director David J.  Burke puts him not only in the essentially primary role, but also places him aside Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and I am surprised he was as good LL Cool J.  I can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with Timberlake.There is an upside to this of course the moment any of these actors interact without Justin there it feels like a double relief.  A pleasure, if you will.  Freeman and Spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together, but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our socalled hero.  Dylan McDermott is also a breath of fresh air.But enough of Timberlake bashing  words are not enough in this particular case to do the trick.  Edison is a very, very runofthemill corruption story.  It is plot ranges from clich? to simply preposterous.  I do, however, admire the motivation behind making it, which I interpret as an homage to films like Serpico, or Donnie Brasco, or maybe even Chinatown.  Do not get me wrong  Edison is not even in the same ballpark as these films, but I can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence, perhaps to justify my sitting through it.The script, in and of itself, features some surprisingly bad writing.  Yes, it has some decent interchanges, but any conversation between Piper Perabo who is wasted here and Timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a Dawsons Creek episode.  It is your typical fartooglibforreality, let usimpresstheaudiencewithhowwellwearticulate and fail dialogue.  This dialogue, mind you, is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments  sometimes it feels like Edison wants to morph into a music video, where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting, but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds read slowmotion.Thinking about it, Edison is a curiosity.  It is sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by Timberlake who simply does not work.  In film as in most art, if one thing is off, the whole thing feels off.  Directors must make tough choices.  David J.  Burke missed the mark here.  Some of the scenes play well in and of themselves, but as a whole, they do not seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture.  And it is not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with.",

		"When a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible, the cause can invariably be found in the book either it was pointless to start with, or the point is one not easily conveyed to film, or the movie missed the point, which is the most frequent of these results, and the easiest to happen, especially when the point is one not easily defined.  The book Morvern Callar has a point; every reader of the book must have felt this, and felt as if he had gotten it; but I suspect most of them could not state it in words.  I am sure I I am sure I I am sure I No doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition.  But the important fact is that there is a pointpossibly the sum of the entire story is the pointand that this would have been the main thing to keep in view, and to carry over, in adapting the story to film.  The maker of this film evidently missed the point, and does not substitute one of her own; and so the film is about nothing.This is not the usual complaint of a booklover that his favorite text has been violated.  The merit of the book is something I conceded grudgingly in reading it I found it a bloody nuisance, and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly.  The narrative is supposed to be the work of the halfeducated Morvern, but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect, as if the author were poking at her with his pen; there are inconsistencies of style and tone, as if different sections had been composed at different times; and any conclusions I could reach about Morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not for instance, despite Morverns own selfcharacterization as a raver, am I wrong that in the end she remains essentially a workingclass Scots girl, and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past?  In any case, despite my irritation at the author, I could not deny that his book stuck with me; and what I could not get out of my head was his characters attitude, her angle on the world, which was almost as vivid as a Goya portrait.  Morvern is the kind of person who is always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible; occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her, like flies, so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful sloggingthrough, unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophicaland that does not begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough.  The complex of incidents and of Morverns responses to them are the substance of the book, and its achievement, in exposing a crosssection of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise; for all my dislike of the book, I can see this.The Morvern just described is not the Morvern of the movie; or if it is, most of her is kept offscreen.  An actress who might have been a good fit for the character, had she been the right age at the right time, is Angharad Rees, from the old TV series Poldark.  Samantha Morton, then, would seem like good casting she is rather the same sort of actress, and in one of her earlier movies, Jesus Son, she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one.  Unfortunately, as the film turned out, she does not have the character from the book to play.  For one thing, the book is one that, if it is to be dramatized, virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience; without her comments, her perspective, her voice, the story loses most of its meaning.  It has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty, and so Morverns responses whether of amusement or distaste, depending on her mood are missing too, and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story.  In short, the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk, edgy seriocomic novel into a genteel art TV film, and chose as her typical image one of Ms.  Morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy; as if the outing Morvern signs up for were a tour of the Stations of the Cross.  This is not at all what the book, or the Morvern of the book, was about.  For another thing, the Morvern of the movie is not Scottish the actress said in an interview she had not had time to study up the accent, and she ought to be it is important that she, her family, and her mates are all from a single place.  And finally the film is missing the end of the story Morverns spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness it is winter, the dam has frozen, the power has gone out, and the pub is dark.  Minus this, and minus all of the rest, what is left is a failed art film, a dead film, about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal, or native inability, ever to give in to being dead.",

Ramsey cannot bring Callar to life.  Her attempts are too arty and oblique.  Repeatedly her camera lingers on long silent shots of the agonizing actress as if Mortons obliterated gaze alone could supply character.  We are Warholian hell We are Warholian hell But how will it do so if she rarely speaks?  Without the novels interior monologue, the celluloid Morvern Callar is nobody.  Small wonder Ramsey has Morton undress often.That said, the first ten minutes were so impressively acted, shot and edited that my hopes were soaring.

I really do not care what young lassies from Scotland do these days, who thy screw, what drugs they take.  Andalucia was high point The nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend.  As the movie came to a close I had two thoughts... 1.  That is all there is?  2.  Now I see why her boyfriend killed himself.  Rename it.  Bare Bitch Boredom, or What I did on my trip to Spain.  I am such a sucker for sticking these things out.",
		"My dad is a fan of Columbo and I had always disliked the show.  I always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is.  But he goes on watching it none the less.  That is his right as an American I guess.  But my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that Spielberg had directed the premier episode.  It was then that I was thankful that my dad had bought this show that I really cannot stand.  I went through his DVD collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college.  he started low tier Spielberg knowing low tier I did low tier And that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along get the pun, HA,HA.  Like Spielberg did.  It is like Jesus before he became a man.  Or thats at least what I think that would feel like.  Any ways if your fan of Columbo than you would most likely like this, even though it contains little of Peter Falk.  I attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet.  This episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of Columbos investigation, as many later episodes would do.",
		"I am arty movies I am pretentious drivel Agonisingly slow to develop a nonexistent plot based on a promising premise, the experience is, shall we say, trying.  Even after bad movies I feel that I learn something, or enjoyed some aspect, but there there was nothing to appreciate.  The premise was not uninteresting, but the movie starts and ends there.  The acting was OK, though the characters were utterly boring.  For the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal, she is mightily empty.  Pity.  I usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic, but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content.",

		"it depicts mathematical modeling In the episodes that Charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models, I thought that my profession was being joked about.  I am not a mathematician, instead a chemical engineer, but I do work a lot with mathematical models.  So I will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to makebelieve of fairy tales.First, choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task.  Charlie Eppes is shown as a genius, but even him would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model, specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future.  Individuals are erratic and haphazard, there is no modeling for them.  Isaac Asimov even wrote about that in the 1950s.  Even if there were a model for specific kind of individual, it would be a probabilistic stoichastic one, meaning it has good chance of making a wrong prediction.Second, supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found, the model parameters have to be known.  These parameters are the constants of the equations, such as the gravity acceleration 9.8 ms2, and often are not easy to determine.  Again, Charlie Eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses.  And after the model and the parameters are chosen, they would have to be tested.  Oddly, they are not, and by miracle, they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted.Third, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected, not only by Numbers, but also by scifi movies the computational effort required for solving these models.  Try to make Excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a Herculean job.  Even if Charlie Eppes has the right software to solve his models, he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow.  And even with the right softwarehardware combination, the model solution might well take days to be reached.  He solves them immediately!  I could use his computer in my research work, I would be very glad.As a drama, it is far from being the best show.  The characters are somewhat stereotyped, but not even remotely funny as those in Big Bang Theory are.  The crimes are dull and the way Charlie Eppes solves them sometimes make the FBI look pretty incompetent.For some layman, the show might work.  For others, the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow!",

		"The math aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this TV show apart from the millions of other cop shows.

In order to catch a fugitive, the mathematician uses some theory about bubbles.  So, he gives this long explanation that, if we have seen the suspect in places A, B and C, then we can use bubble theory to calculate where he might be.  He does this all on a chalkboard, or maybe with a stick in the dirt I cant remember.Anyway, when you look at the finished product, he basically took three spots, and picked a point right in the middle and said Ok, mathematically, heres where we are most likely to find the fugitive.  At which point, one other character points out Oh, that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live.  Is that math?  Its not even connectthefkgdots!!!

The rest of the movie is forgettable.  The score and songs are more interesting than the script.  Ditto the sequel.  Which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all.

I could not get involved with Treat Williams portrayal of Cooper, either.  He should have been fascinating, but he was not in this movie.  It is also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of folk hero, but I admit I wound up rooting for the guy, too.Not everything was disappointing.  it is oneofakind story",
		"people thought stinking heap Shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty, disgust and stupidity, There is Something About Mary leaves little reason to stay until the end.  Sure, Cameron Diaz is very pretty, but that is never going to be enough to save a movie.  Ben Stiller tries hard to work within the plot, and is obviously very talented, but the movie is a loser.Not once were any of the scenes believable.  The shots were badly timed and poorly framed.  The Farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs.  I check IMDB to see what they are working on just so I know what to avoid.210; the bonus is from the one time I smiled.  It is not like I am immune to humor or alone in my opinion.  My wife hated it, too.  The next day we saw Rush Hour and laughed ourselves silly.  This movie just stunk.",

It also show is how people give the Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype, by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad Muslims out it does not mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time, like how hard it was for Amair to get on a plane and how he used words like Blow up or Yaser saying we will blow away the competition, and people took it the wrong way.  Being a Muslim i know that stuff like this do not usually happen, but they do and many people think bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq, its not right things are not like that. people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act.  I am glad a show like this came on the air.  There are many shows that Piotr Muslim people as terrorists,many people do find them funny to my opioion it is OK to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair, but it is done to often and really gives Muslin people a bad name.",

		"Up until this new season I have been a big Little Mosque fan.  However, the new season had absolutely RUINED it.The new Christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show.  It has always been about living together to overcome prejudice.  The new vicar ruins that premise and shows Christians in a very bad light.I am neither Christian or Muslim, but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between Amar and the Reverend.  Not any more.Just cancel it and be done with it.  It is old format",
		"Who likes awful comedy shows like Little Mosque on the Prairie?  The only two kinds of people I can think of who watch this are One, Muslims and selfproclaimed Liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about Muslims that it does not even matter if the show is good or funny at all which it is not.  Two, old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable, badly written, stale jokes.CBC needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is.  they keep old people I would be curious who even writes for this show?  Do you think it is actually Muslims, or hip, funny young people?  No, I bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC shows since the 1960s.When you look at the CBC comedy shows there are, Air Farce was only finally just taken off the air thank goodness!  but we still have lame ducks like This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Rick Mercer that we are paying for, not to mention this poor excuse for comedy Little Mosque on the Prairie.  It is supposed to be offencive and funny?  Only the CBC would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny.

		"This movie is one long chiche after another.  First of all, though they did their share, there is a unwarranted dope scene where John sniffs weed like an idiot.  The wigs and accents are terrible.  They sound old Beatle John is the nasty, envious, closet homosexual, slave to Yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited Albert Goldman book.  They even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation it was always just the Two Of Us!  John would not have been mean to his fans like this either.  Like his death showed us he was too nice if anything.  The one funny scene is where a dumb Beatle fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Pauls Yesterday.  An insulted John says something along the lines of Sure and while I croon why do not you get down on your knees, put on your wifes wig, and lick my liggin.  That made me laugh for days.  Really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous.  John and Paul also did not sit pontificating all day, they were funny light hearted guys who even during The Beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here.  Forget it.",

		"I was Indian Candians The producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it is getting talked about!  I was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason, they are usually true.  But there really was not anything funny about these stereotypical characters.  The fresh of the boat dad, who does not understand his daughter.  The radical feminist Muslim daughter who by the way is a terrible actress, and the young modern Indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can he is a pretty good actor, i only see him getting better.it is very contrived and the dialog does not flow that well. there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed, and do not really care to watch another episode.I did however enjoy watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again, she is always a treat and a natural at everything she does, too bad her daughter in the show does not have the same acting abilities!",

		"Once again Canadian TV outdoes itself and creates another show that will go unwatched after its premiere episode.  Last time I remember sitcoms were supposed to induce a reaction we in the business call laughter.  How funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people thinking that all Muslims are terrorists?  OK maybe one joke just to stick it to the masses.  But not 30 minutes.  It is called beating a dead horse.  Even SNL would know to give up after a commercial break.Also, let us have a little conflict in these scripts.  Will she or will not she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast on Ramadan?  When will Ramadan start?  Ohhhhh this is Emmy winning stuff here.  And the characters!  What characters?!  They are all cardboard cutouts without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to the next.  That is the point of the situation comedy.  We need to have strong, interesting, dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the TV set each week.  We have to care about these characters to worry about what trouble they are going to get into next week.  If I never see these characters it will be too soon.  Thankfully I cannot remember any of their names note to CBC  that is not a good sign.And the acting is so bland.  It is more so a problem in casting than in the actors.  None of these people actually embody the characters they play.  They just seem to act their part as though they were working on a movie of the week.  Sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character  make us fall in love with them  where they become inseparable from the character the portray.  Watch any American sitcom and you will see how easily identifiable characters are.  Part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as though it might be a platform to bigger and better things instead of being their one big character of a lifetime for whom they will spend the next 8 years portraying.  That level of disinterest in the characters and the project shows.  But to be honest, considering the lame concept and the horrible writing, there is not much for the actors to do but say their lines and try not to bump into any furniture.  As another commenter mentions, this seems like a TV movie and not a sitcom.And the directing or lack there of!  What can I say, Canada has so much talent, look at what the Comedy Channel is doing with Puppets Who Kill and Punched Up.  Look at the Trailer Park Boys not the movie cause it bit the big helium dog.  Look at any American show to see the potentials our talent as that is where many of our stars go to find decent work.Give credit to the CBC, they really know how to build publicity for a nonevent.

		"This show is a perfect example of how the CBC should stick to either news, sports, or satirical sketch comedy.  As a developer of situation comedy, CBC has shown it can combine the pizazz of King of Kensington with the belly laughs of The Beachcombers.  they have lame production.I It is lame production.I To start, half of the concept is a direct attempt to ripoff one of the few sitcom successes in EnglishCanadian history, Corner Gas.  The rest of the conceptthe cultural clashis far from being original and is too often used as a crutch for screen writing laziness.  The selection of the Muslim religion as the basis for the fish out of water characters seems to be a desperate attempt to be edgy and topical, but comes off as forced.  Some of the jokes that are based around the locals reaction to the newcomers are cringe inducing and thoroughly insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved, especially the audience.This show is a perfect example of how CBC just does not get it when it comes to creating Canadian content, especially when presenting Canada as a multicultural environment.  Cultural diversity in Canada does not have to be presented in such a heavyhanded and forced way.  It would be a refreshing change to see CBC introduce diversity into a television show without making the show all about said diversity.  I doubt that CBC has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle.  A comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in Corner Gasi.e. the aboriginal characters are not set apart by their ethnicity nor is their heritage used to generate story lines.  More realistically, their lives and the other characters lives intertwine in a way that makes ethnicity no more significant than any of their other personal characteristics.That being said, even as a formulaic fishoutofwater comedy this show fails.  The acting is weak, the comic pacing all over the map, and the story premises that I saw were too far beyond the suspension of belief, even for a comedy.  The only saving grace is the talented Derek McGrath, who is horribly wasted here.  I doubt that even the addition of guest stars Colin Mochrie, for example, as an Anglican archbishop can save this dog.  I decided to give the show a chance once the CBCs hype had died down; but two episodes were all I could standI could almost feel my braincells shutting themselves down with each failed punchline.  The timeslot would be better served by airing more Coronation Street, Air Farce reruns, or Dr.  Who.  Even an infomercial would be an improvement.",

		"I think good concept But the execution was poor.  The script is poor and acting is bad.  There were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way, like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard.  The show cannot be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably.  I should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of Muslim community to some extent.Till now second season is worse than the first one.  I had my hopes high regarding this show, but I was kind of disappointed.  Still I appreciate CBC for putting up such concept in front of the viewers.  Anyway I wish best of luck for the future.",

I am huge fan I am Strange Days I had Strange Days But the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration.  In all that time, it barely went beyond its two line synopsis, and I would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere.  On top of that, I do not think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular ATeam episode.  As for Alba, yes, she is gorgeous, of course, but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie pouty and surly, makes me also get bored of her gal wit an attitude schtick pretty soon.

		"What was an exciting and fairly original series by Fox has degraded down to meandering tripe.  During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly must see list, and not just because of Jessica Alba.Unfortunately, the powersthatbe over at Fox decided that they needed to finetune the plotline.  Within 3 episodes of the season opener, they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see Jessica Alba!.  I found second season The new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin.  On one of the second season episodes, they even had Max sleeping and dreaming  where the first season stated she biologically could not sleep.The moral of the story the one that Hollywood never gets If it works, do not screw with it! azjazz",

The movie is just destroyed in the third act.  Why?  The murders, twists, turns and characters have all been revolving around NUCLEAR MATERIAL?  What the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that?  The way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history.

		"Hammer is true sociopaths Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put pieces together to solve the mystery, Hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth.  This film turns Hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well, too dumb to get away with anything.  One is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack.Other parts of the movie are right out of the Three Stooges play book.  Veldas dance at the barre, for instance, or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back.  And the continuity breaks are shameful Frau Blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she is way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot.  The worst break, however, precedes the popcorn attack.  The bad guy stalking Hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero, except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy.To be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting, and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen, which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10.",

		"Saw this film ran in the wee hours on TCM.  Several problems with the film were apparent from what I saw.  First, the adults did not age when the children did for 10 years.  Several parts of the film had continuity problems  for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the 10 years passed.  The copy I saw was missing about 20 minutes or so, at least a huge gap with black screen appeared.  It is too bad, because even though the script left something to be desired, Bergman  Russell both did fine in the film in their roles.  It is large chunk It is large chunk The script makes little sense in that Bergmans character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults?  Some of the time lines do not make sense either.  There is a stock market crash that resembles 1929 but the kids grow up to fight in World War 1.

Hollywood thought foreign accent Bergman plays foreign accent Just about everyone in the movie is so goodygood it is a relief when Susan Hayward as the villainess enters midway through  she is about the only watchable person in the movie even though she is clearly channeling Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; it is also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles  but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous.

		"You would think that with Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter that this film would have been a lot better.  Sadly, the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brainaddled.The film begins with Ingrid Bergman coming to work for the Stoddard family.  Everything is so very peachy and swellthe family adores Bergman and things could not be more perfect.  Well, that is until the mother Fay Wray dies, the stock market crashes in 1907 wiping out the familys fortune and Bergman is forced to go back home to France.  This portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet, but not bad.Later, after the familys fortunes have improved, Bergman returns.  The four boys are now all grown and there is not really a conceivable reason why they would hire her once again as a governess.  But, briefly, everything is swell once again.  But, when WWI occurs, the four all go to wargosh!  In the midst of this, one of the sons David brings home his new wife Susan Hayward.  Miss Haywards character is as black and white as the others, though while they are all good and swell, she is obviously a horny shedevil.  To make things worse, she comes to live in the family home while David is at war.Now here is where the movie gets really, really dumbbrainachingly dumb.  Hayward begins an affair with one of Davids brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers, Bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her, not Hayward with Jack!  WHY?!  Why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman?  This was exactly the sort of excuse Bergman needed to get rid of the guttersnipe once and for all!  This is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad...and most likely did the same to the audiences back in 1941.The rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for Haywards evilness to be exposed.  This just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess.  everyone is wonderful family Haywards affair made no senseat least in how it was handled.  And, having characters who are so goshdarn good or evil with nothing in between sinks this movie to the level of a secondrate soap.  The only thing that saves it at all is the actingthey tried as best they could with a turgid script.  Suffice to say that the Columbia Pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken!",

I am sorry, but I cannot believe the kids need a governess now.  Hayward is quite right when she confronts her that it was not the kids who brought her back.

This movie, however, ruined that excitement for me.  Meg was fizzy curls I am fizzy curls In the movie, she has straight hair and no glasses and is the sporty type with a deep voice.  This is not how Madeleine LEngle pictured Meg to be at all.  In fact, Meg was based on Madeleines character and depicted the way she felt when she was young.

		"We all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books.  While not particularly accurate adaptations, these movies were nonetheless excellent films.  Some great examples are the Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and, to a lesser extent, almost every Disney film ever made.  However, I must regretfully announce that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those movies.  Not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of Madeleine LEngles fan base, it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting, acting, special effects and, ultimately, respect for the audience.  Mind you, I am not trying to be mean; on the contrary, I went into this affair with an open mind.  I figured that a madeforT.V. movie would make up for its lack of razzledazzle in its script.  After all, the Star Wars spinoff Ewoks was decent, if a little silly.  Come to think of it, the original Star Wars was made on a lunch money budget, and look where it took George Lucas!  However, from the first scene onward, disappointment started enveloping me as if I would gotten too close to the Black Thing while tessering.  The same way Greedo shooting first became the symbol of the Star Wars Special Edition of 1997 a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic, Mrs.  Whatsit has personal symbol The reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief.  Aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting Alfre Woodard Star Trek First Contact and Radio as our favorite starturnedmentor, the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow.  That is right, a crow.  Moreover, the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eightyearold; the majestic halfman, halfhorse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle.  Had I been five, this would have psychologically traumatized me for life.  The worst part is the fact that when it spoke, it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync, resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single, unmoving cheek, thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than E.T.Having gotten the most painful part out of the way, I must go on to the tearinducing one the characters, the acting, and the story.  I, personally, had always imagined Meg to look somewhat similar to Moaning Myrtle from the Harry Potter films plain hair, glasses, and a figure most supermodels would find laughable.  She was always a slightly anxious, humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of Nicaragua.  In the film, she is an unpleasant knowitall for whom I have no sympathy whatsoever.  In fact, she makes me feel sorry for poor Mr.  Jenkins, her school principal, who continuously has to deal with her.  Calvin, the kind, intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has becomea jock!  The irony is horrible.  As for the memorable Happy Medium, they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is above gender and likes to look at funny things, such as girls falling off of swings.  The only three people I can think of who did a decent job are Charles Wallace, Mrs.  Whatsit and the Man With Red Eyes nicknamed the Dude With Red Eyes due to his complete reinvention as a character.The story is a mess.  A good comparison to this aspect of the movie is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which did not do a good job of retelling the story found in the book, yet kept the sole of the original work.  Here, the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with Hades down in the underworld, apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed.  As the Dark Lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen, the flatnosed wookies of Ixchel who replace the wondrous beings who hold Aunt Beast among their ranks tear the spine up.  As the God of the Dead notes how subtle the terror of the Earthlike Camazotz was, the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil.  I am very sorry that this film exists.  I do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad.  It is the way the characters are written that ruins it.  A Wrinkle in Time deserved to be adapted by Lawrence Kasdan, directed by George Lucas or Steven Spielberg, enhanced at Industrial Light and Magic, scored by John Williams, given its sound at Skywalker Sound, edited by THX and marketed by Twentieth Century Fox.  In its current state, the film is unworthy to be shown to selfrespecting people.  Even Madeleine LEngle thought it was bad.

The same way Greedo shooting first became the symbol of the Star Wars Special Edition of 1997 a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic, Mrs.  Whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is A Wrinkle in Time.  The reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief.  Aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting Alfre Woodard Star Trek First Contact and Radio as our favorite starturnedmentor, the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow.  That is right, a crow.  Moreover, the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eightyearold; the majestic halfman, halfhorse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle.  Had I been five, this would have psychologically traumatized me for life.  The worst part is the fact that when it spoke, it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync, resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single, unmoving cheek, thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than E.T.Having gotten the most painful part out of the way, I must go on to the tearinducing one the characters, the acting, and the story.  I, personally, had always imagined Meg to look somewhat similar to Moaning Myrtle from the Harry Potter films plain hair, glasses, and a figure most supermodels would find laughable.  She was always a slightly anxious, humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of Nicaragua.  In the film, she is an unpleasant knowitall for whom I have no sympathy whatsoever.  In fact, she makes me feel sorry for poor Mr.  Jenkins, her school principal, who continuously has to deal with her.  Calvin, the kind, intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has becomea jock!  The irony is horrible.  As for the memorable Happy Medium, they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is above gender and likes to look at funny things, such as girls falling off of swings.  The only three people I can think of who did a decent job are Charles Wallace, Mrs.  Whatsit and the Man With Red Eyes nicknamed the Dude With Red Eyes due to his complete reinvention as a character.The story is a mess.  A good comparison to this aspect of the movie is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which did not do a good job of retelling the story found in the book, yet kept the sole of the original work.  Here, the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with Hades down in the underworld, apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed.  As the Dark Lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen, the flatnosed wookies of Ixchel who replace the wondrous beings who hold Aunt Beast among their ranks tear the spine up.  As the God of the Dead notes how subtle the terror of the Earthlike Camazotz was, the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil.  I am very sorry that this film exists.  I do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad.  It is the way the characters are written that ruins it.  A Wrinkle in Time deserved to be adapted by Lawrence Kasdan, directed by George Lucas or Steven Spielberg, enhanced at Industrial Light and Magic, scored by John Williams, given its sound at Skywalker Sound, edited by THX and marketed by Twentieth Century Fox.  In its current state, the film is unworthy to be shown to selfrespecting people.  Even Madeleine LEngle thought it was bad.  The book was Good, the film was Bad, and Mrs.  Whatsit was Ugly.Score 0.110 If I could ProsThey got the names right.  It had horrible problems Oh, and the main coverposter has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle.  Some might say that this symbolizes high adventure.  I say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who did not even bother to Photoshop Megs arm on properly.",
		"This movie barely followed the story line of the movie.  All of the fascinating points in the book did not even exist in the movie.  They ended cheesy tween It was so bad it should have been Hillary Duff playing the part, or one of the likes.  This movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book.  I cannot believe Disney could even get away with making such a cheap, basic rendition.  If you have ever read the book, I think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of Lord of the Rings equivalence.  This movie should have never been able to use the title of A Wrinkle in Time.  Poorly done.",

		"I only recently found out that Madeleine LEngles novel had been turned into a TV movie by Disney and ordered the DVD.  I read several times.Despite I was several times.Despite The first half hour is promising enough, doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene.  Unfortunately as soon as the nonhuman characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart.  Alfre Woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric Mrs Whatsit think Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright instead and Kate Nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive, she must have visited Faye Dunaways plastic surgeon in recent years.  For some reason they make her Mrs Which look like Glinda from The Wizard of Oz when she should have resembled a benign Wicked Witch of the West.In the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction.  I understand that this is a TV movie, but the CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier.  Mrs Whatsits centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the Chewbacca like suit for Aunt Beast, who in the novel is a velvety, elegant creature instead of the ungainly Big Foot like thing shown here.  I could go on and on, nearly every artistic choice is a disaster, presumably because there was not a large enough budget to do this justice, but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement.This really would have needed the sense of wonder Spielberg brought to his early films.  What a shame that with the current popularity of adapting childrens literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting A Wrinkle in Time and it is sequels for the big screen, giving it the scope it deserves.",

I kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie.  Well, it was not just me.  Nearly every single one felt the same waycheated out of the great story that Madeline LEngle had so skillfully created!

There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs.  Ws as added tension, there is enough tension in the story without that.  There was no reason to remove Megs glasses... that deprived us of what could have been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg that happens in the book.I could nitpick for days about little things, but I also think larger things, like the art direction was a off.

It has people on it that look like humans.  The skies are blue, the grass is green, and there are children playing.  But something is a little bit off.  The directors chose to make Camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie.

The direction was weak.  I had hard time There was not a real connection with the viewer about what was going on.  The dialog did not explain adequately what was happening.  It just seemed slapped together and rushed through.  All in all I was very disappointed with the movie.  I suppose if you have not read the book, it might be ok by itself.

It was campy fun it was complete disaster It was complete disaster The colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them.  The plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing  what a stretch!  Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre.  Just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this.ejames6342",
		"This movie is such a bad work!  Nothing seems to even try and be realistic.  Plot is 1st year What a flop!  What a waste of time, money and effort to all concerned including the audience.  Well, as in any thriller, here too are murders, corpses and blood.  Just imagine someone who 5 minutes ago, committed a murder with a knife, and came out calm and smiling, not to mention clean as a whistle, as if slashing ones throat is done by a virtual agent.  Also, this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male, and she cut his throat!!!  Did she ask him, politely, to bend down for her?  Much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one.  Continuity is another huge problem as for instance The eagerhungry groom is lying in bed, waiting for his virginbride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while, falls asleep!?!.  Next scene opens with the young couple entering the receptionarea, asking for guidance to scenery spots!  NOT A WORD ABOUT LAST NIGHT???  Such a waste of time even to try and write about this lowlow supposedtobe movie.",

		"As a writer I find films this bad making it into production a complete slap in the face.  Talk about insulting.  I was 8th grade Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing and when added all together the result is complete and total failure.  The only thing this movie manages to accomplish is tricking the unsuspecting consumer into wasting their time.  Who would green light something so poorly written?  It is not artistic, clever, smart, suspenseful, mysterious, scary, dramaticNOTHING.The characters are flat and boring with no development.  The plot is as recycled as an aluminum can.  They somehow managed to cast a few very familiar actors who all must be pretty desperate for work or hoping one of these low budget independent movies will turn out to be the next Pulp Fiction.  This script should have been used to line a bird cage, not a movie.  Oh and last but not least, a 52 105 lb woman of course has the strength to kill men and women twice her size without a struggle and in a single blow.  Avoid this bomb like it will infect you with an STD.",

		"I regret single second Unhappily, I always find it hard to switch off a movie once I started watching it.  Especially, when it is such a classic or what people use to call a classic.  I think that this is one of those movies every movielover should have watched at least one time, so that was why I watched it.  Do not get me wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall both as a couple and as actors, but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion.  No really good plot, neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story.  Well, not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres.  Only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether Bogey and Bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another.  I think To Have and Have Not is very overrated and Bogart was in many better films during the 1940s.",

It does not, so he cannot be a cynic; Hawks wanted it both ways a character who is both the cool lone cynic and yet a wellmeaning humanitarian.  I do not think so...  Bacall does her nonchalant cool babe routine for the first time, and there are plenty of overrated, not alltoo interesting socalled sexual innuendo exchanges between her and Bogey; these dialogues sound silly by todays standards.

Her bony face, with its sharp features, is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de Havilland, the cuteness of a Myrna Loy, let alone the likability of an Irene Dunne.  Bacall was more suited for playing vampires, not femmefatales.  In real life she is very much like her face a Hollywood bitch.

		"I saw secondrun theatre I did secondrun theatre I enjoyed secondrun theatre I was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the Tenniel drawings.  But to me, the cast was largely squandered, their personalities muffled by the masks, while the direction I think of as being unusually static, and the photography murky.  The rating jotted down at the time was a nought, which means not worth sitting through even once.Still, I too would jump at a chance to have a second look.",
		"This is one of those films that I could only sit through once.  Charlotte Henry is fine  in fact, all the actors were fine.  The problem was in the script, the dialog, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects.  Granted, this was 1933, but it really creaked.  Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C.  Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming.  The movie just clumped along with no cohesion.  Much of Lewis Carrols spirit, humor and continuity are missing.  What a pity!  It is great book I would recommend Disneys 1951 version.",

		"While the premise behind The House Where Evil Dwells may be intriguing, the execution is downright pathetic.  I have many problems I am many problems I suppose I will just number a few of them 1.  The Acting  When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure, and Susan George and her teeth are the stars of your movie, you know you are in trouble?  Not that it matters much to me, but these are hardly AList names.  Susan George may have been in a couple of movies I enjoy, but I have never considered her the greatest actress I have ever seen.  And in this movie, her acting is embarrassing.  As for the other two, the less said the better.2.  The Ghosts  The ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride.at Disney World.  And, they are about as frightening.  And why did they have to be so obvious?  Subtlety is not a characteristic of The House Where Evil Dwells.3.  The Plot  How predictable can one movie be?  The outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters.  If you could not see where this movie was headed after about 15 minutes, you need to see more movies.4.  The Convenient Priest  What are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of Japanese monks?  Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over, knocks on the door, and asks if you need help removing evil spirits.  Absurd is a word that comes to mind.5.  Everything Else  It is very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about.  I suppose I will give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the houses architecture.  That is a sure sign of a winner  noting the architecture as a highlight of any film does not say much about the actual movie.I will stop.  You should be able to get the idea from what I have already mentioned.  And, I have not even mentioned the annoying little girl or the Invasion of the Crabs or a multitude of other problems.

Just picking up a 16mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie.I guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director did not pick up someones camcorder...Second, indie films are supposed to be about real people.

		"I do classic ghost I do classic ghost This does not really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film does not tack on one of those happy endings.  Story is about an American couple who travel to Kyoto, Japan so that Ted Fletcher Edward Albert can write a book and he brings along his wife Laura Susan George and their daughter Amy Amy Barrett.  Their friend Alex Curtis Doug McClure who works at the American Consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted.  About 140 years earlier in the same house a Samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide.  Their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the Fletchers arrive it does not take long before strange things start happening.SPOILER ALERTAt times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the Fletchers and they start to act like the Japanese people that they were before and Laura starts to flirt with Alex which leads to an affair.  Meanwhile, Ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of Amy he goes to ask a Monk for help.  Unfortunately the ghosts get Ted, Laura, and Alex to play out their death scene like it happened 140 years earlier.This film was directed by Kevin Connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with McClure on some of them.  While this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that I liked.  First, it does not have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons.  Instead, it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts.  Secondly, it has Susan George in the cast!  I have always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch.  Also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she does not have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and it is one of the reasons why she was so popular.  But after appearing in silly films such as this I think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically.  This is not a bad film but it is never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the Monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two.  The bottom line is that this is silly and I hope George decides to resume her career.",

While this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that I liked.

		"Dull haunted house thriller finds an American family moving into a 200 year old house in Japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred.  Novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of Motel Hell.  The film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall.  One obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned.  The monk recounts the history of the house which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence and then the film simply cuts away to something else.  Earlier the monk had offered to help.  Well, where is the help?  things get very end",
		"The film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional Japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads KUSHIATA KYOTO, JAPAN 1840.  he is Masanoris teacher Shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other.  His honour destroyed the enraged Samurai brutally murders both Otami and Masanori before committing suicide.  Over a century later and Ted Fletcher Edward Albert arrives in Japan on a working holiday with his wife Laura Susan George and their young daughter Amy Amy Barrett.  Their close friend Alex Curtis Doug McClure who works for the American consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay, you do not need me to you where!  He jokingly says it is going so cheap because it is haunted, to which both Ted and Laura laugh off as they obviously do not believe in ghosts, at least for the time being that is.  Almost immediately the film goes into clich? mode.  Lights turn on and off by themselves, Laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local Zen Monk Henry Mitowa gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it is too late which they ignore, of course.  The spirits of Otami, Masanori and Shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a Majyo witches Tsuyako Olajima curse put upon them.  But there may be a way they can break the curse, unfortunately for the Fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage, daughter and possibly even their very lives.  Directed by Kevin Connor I thought this was a pretty average film, OK to watch once if you have got nothing better to do but after a day or two you will probably have completely forgotten it.  Nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there is nothing particularly good about the film either.  The script by Robert Suhosky from the novel by James Hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly bythenumbers, a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction does not help things.  There are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get Amy and her babysitter, Noriko Mayumi Umeda.  And there is a scene where the Zen Monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in, however that is until Ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in, some exorcism!  One more thing, I think it was a bad idea to have Doug McClure who was 47 when he made this, try his hand at KungFu and oriental sword fighting!  George gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with McClure, although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present.  Apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations there is no blood, gore or violence to speak about.  The transparent ghost effects are OK but they as not going to impress many people these days.  It is professionally enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the Japanese setting and myths is squandered as this film could have been set in America, England or any Western country without having to change a thing.  An OK time waster.",

There are giant crabs that attack a girl. oh, and the crabs sing Japanese.  It is amazingly bad.  And the ending, which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome.  Predictable, but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat.  Do not even give this film a chance and you will love it.  Susan George is fun to watch and yes, she does appear naked.  she does giant crabs They are the size of large cats.  This is a 2, but I love it.  As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I give it a 7.  Did I mention there are giant crabs?",

BUT then the ending is actually very good!  Sure, The Grudge basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurais and that is what I liked about this movie comparatively.Please, someone one with a tempered style remake this movie.Fans of Silent Rage would absolutely love this movie.",
		"..It is THIS ONE!  Very cool premise, right off the bat.Has an excellent first scene, gotta give credit where credit is due.Has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me Whenever the ghosts appeared, which I really liked by the way; how it was done, how it looked...the only thing was the ghosts relationship.  Because of the way things went down in the first scene you would think their dynamic would be different.Things slowed down a little too much in the middle I felt, and the crabspider scene was just not good.  BUT then the ending is actually very good!  I liked Silent Rage",
		"At the beginning of the film, you might doublecheck the DVD cover and reread the synopsis a couple of times, but no worries.  It is NOT Memoirs of a Geisha that you purchased; just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be.  Still, the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie, as it shows how in the year 1840 a Samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery.  He decapitates the two lovers before doing some harakiri ritual suicide through disembowelment.  Cut to present day, when the American Ambassador in Japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago.  From then onwards, this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional.  us start British horror The bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent, imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter.  The restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff.  The spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into Susans ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress!  In this possessed state, she even lures the American ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests.  So, strictly spoken, it is not really evil that dwells in the house; just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their longdead hands!  Obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening, especially since the lightblue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in Ghostbusters.  The House Where Evil Dwells is probably the least scary ghost movie ever.

But then again, everyone in the cast continues to speak hisher lines with a straight and sincere face, so I guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed.  The House Where Evil Dwells is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it does not even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning.

		"At the beginning of the film, you might doublecheck the DVD cover and reread the synopsis a couple of times, but no worries.  It is NOT Memoirs of a Geisha that you purchased; just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be.  Still, the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie, as it shows how in the year 1840 a Samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery.  He decapitates the two lovers before doing some harakiri ritual suicide through disembowelment.  Cut to present day, when the American Ambassador in Japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago.  From then onwards, this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional.  Let us start with the good aspects, namely the original Japanese setting and the presence of the delicious Susan George who is my alltime favorite British horror wench well, together with Britt Eckland, Linda Hayden and Ingrid Pitt.  The bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent, imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter.  The restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff.  The spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into Susans ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress!  In this possessed state, she even lures the American ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests.  So, strictly spoken, it is not really evil that dwells in the house; just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their longdead hands!

		"This could have been interesting  a Japanset haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newlyinstalled American family  but falls flat due to an oversimplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director.The film suffers from the same problem I often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare, i.e. the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they are expected to!  Besides, it does not deliver much in the scares department  a giant crab attack is merely silly  as, generally, the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way, such as Susan George seducing diplomatfriendofthefamily Doug McClure and Edward Albert forcefeeding his daughter a bowl of soup!  At one point, an old monk turns up at the house to warn Albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually, he is called upon to exorcise the premises.  tragedy is impromptu karate At the end of the day, this emerges an innocuous timewaster  tolerable at just 88 minutes but, in no way, essential viewing.",

		"From reading all of the comments posted here on IMDb, this movie seems to get ragged on a lot, but I did not think it was THAT bad.  I have old house Little do they know, a Japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover, and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword.  As strange things happen in the house, the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living, and plan on reenacting the bloody murder that took place 100 years back.I saw this movie and decided to give it a chance, from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story.  It was routine, and it was corny, but I have seen worse in my day.  The ghost sequences were a little overdone, we get to see the translucent bluetinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family, and take over their bodies.  To be honest, the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland.  I may be mistaken, but after watching this, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror film JuOn The Grudge and the American remake of that film ripped this off a little.  The old Japanese home where a brutal murder took place, ghostly activity, curses put on the home, etc.  But I may be wrong.To sum it up, this is a pretty corny ghost story.  Do not go out of your way to see it, but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on TV you can give it a shot. 410.",

		"Director Kevin Connor and wannabe actionhero  romantic lead Doug McClure, reteam in this ghost story set in Japan.  They had been moderately successful together in the 1970s, with the likes of The Land that Time Forgot 1975, At the Earths Core 1976 etc.  Without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though, the results are shabby and derivative in the most corny way.The film begins with a prologue set in the 19th Century, with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide.  A move forward to the present introduces married couple Ted  Laura, visiting Japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place.No surprises as to what happens next, with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend Alex McClure assuming the role of the wifes lover.Everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant, to an inevitable  but surprisingly downbeat  conclusion.  Main points of interest are two feeble decapitations  The Omen has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror setpiece , and the lovemaking scenes featuring the doeeyed but extremely kinky Susan George.  The first is a long Do not Look Now inspired piece with her hubby, complete with piano music; the second a much shorter probably at her insistence entanglement with McClure, both looking pretty uncomfortable.  Anyway, every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show of her fantastic knockers so all is not lost.Overall I cannot decide whether The House where Evil Dwells is rubbish, watchable rubbish, or entertaining in a masochistic kind of way.  If you are not into the genre there is nothing here at all, but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort.BEST SCENE  in any other film the big, black, treeclimbing, Japanesemuttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show.  They are ghostly head On seeing this apparition she asks what kind of soup it is !!!! , to be told beef and vegetable, before uttering the immortal line Ugh  there is an awful face in my soup.  If this was not enough the reply is Cmon, eat your soup for Daddy.  Laurel  Hardy rest in piece.",

		"I just rented and watched this movie just to see what is all the fuss about.  So heres what my reactions to it are.  It is poor actors The main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists.  This concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film.  However, the movie does not shock or disturb me at all.  It just bored me.  This movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minutes.  All lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time, like those scenery scenes and some scenes I described below.Contains spoiler I find the rape scenes quite tame.  I do not know if I have watched the cut or uncut version, if there is actually such a version.  I also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot.  Heres a list on top of my mind.Why do not the rapists rape Jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are.  That would be an excellent time.Why do not they just gang rape her, instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening Jennifers ordeal by such a long time.  It would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way.I found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house.  Maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles.These rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right, they should not send a coward imbecile to do the job.Why did not Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left?  Which should be the first thing that pops up in most peoples mind, especially for someone who is a writer.  Why did not these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw Jennifer is alive? I find it really amazing that a slender lady like Camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him.

		"I have same thing A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them.  The thing that sets this movie apart from those ones although not very far is that the sexual content is not glorified.  There is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film, but not for a second is it ever sexy.  Some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive, but that is only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audiences need to see this woman seek revenge.This is a weak film, it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers.  I Spit On Your Grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral, but I was glad to see that, since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead, it was not meant to pass off as a TA film.Bmovies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality, and while I Spit On You Grave is unmistakably a Bmovie and contains more than its share of nudity, the nudity does not drive the plot.  On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists.  These men are evolutionary dropouts just like they were in the Gator Bait films, and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless Bmovie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind, but instead it simply satisfies the audiences desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve.  The one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks.  Oddly, the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity although not by much, but it is by far the most painful to watch.  We are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller, staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord, but again, this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with.spoilers You know that this is all the movie means to do, since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed.  The woman does not live happily ever after, she does not write her book, she does not leave and never return to that nightmare place, she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks.

But hey, what more did you expect? Oh, and did you read the tagline?  If you decide to waste your time watching this, try and find any man getting broken or burned.  I was really looking forward to those",

The film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic everything but actual penetration is shown that NO ONE but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it.The rapes in the film is uncomfortable, brutal and hard to watch.  There is something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes, none.  There was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed mere moments before he is murdered so the scene is not at all engaging on an emotional level.  Really, it is just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies ISOYG is associated with on IMDb Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc. that it attracts only the exploitation crowd.Finally, a few reviewers have commended Zarchis socalled documentary style and lack of a soundtrack.  But considering how inept everything else in the film is acting, script, etc.  I suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porncaliber actors do their thing.I am not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of ISOYG.  I am all for exploitation  horror and love video nasties.  In fact, I am giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films.

But they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants.  It was of course totally superficial, beautiful English country and seaside or not.The number one mistake was dumping Knightly so early on in the film, when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older, instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part.  They missed lowcost heartstring",
		"Quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom.A group of top quality actors, in the main well cast with a couple of notable exceptions, who give pretty good performances.  Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and equally good is Joanna Lumley as Diana.  All do well with the scripts they were given.So much for the good.  The average would include the sets.  Nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book, although bizarrely the house they use for the Dower House looks remarkably like it.  It is clear then that the Dower House is far too big.  In the later parts, the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the UK, presumably to save money, although with a little imagination I have no doubt they could have recreated Ceylon.Now to the bad.  The screenplay.  This is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it.  Edward does not die in the battle of Britain but survives, blinded.  He makes brief appearance Loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with Gus to a sensible farmers wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear less emotional than Brief Encounter.  Gus, a man besotted and passionately in love, is prepared to give up his love without complaint.  Walter Mudge in the book turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man.  Jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who will not speak.  Aunt Biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification.  The Dower House is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with Jess who has a fear of armed soldiers.  Whilst Miss Mortimers breasts are utterly delightful, I could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward.  The delightfully named Nettlebed becomes the mundane Dobson.  The word limit prevents me from continuing the list.There is a sequel which I lost all interest in watching after this nonsense and I wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story.  It is difficult to image that Rosamunde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book; presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased.",

The Dower House is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with Jess who has a fear of armed soldiers.  Whilst Miss Mortimers breasts are utterly delightful, I could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward.  The delightfully named Nettlebed becomes the mundane Dobson.  The word limit prevents me from continuing the list.There is a sequel which I lost all interest in watching after this nonsense and I wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story.  It is grotesque perversion It is grotesque perversion",

		"Enough is enough...sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead.  The first Tremors movie was great.  The second one was ridiculous.  The third one was nauseating.  The tv series was depressingly awful.  And this movie just drives the stake deeper.Basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry, now we have the series set in the Wild West, in the 1800s, and they fight graboids.  Like a rehash of the first one, they have to learn how to beat them all over again.  Mildly entertaining I suppose.  Otherwise this straighttovideo release, just like Tremors 2 and 3, is just going way too far.  Oh and I continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place...did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event?  I think first film Movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy.  Avoid this garbage.",
		"Dear dear dear dear dear...me!  I had the strength to see it through...  But why?! The first two films where fun and actually somewhat good.  we had whole thing This was some kind of Tremors for kids.  I cannot believe this movie was made at all..seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind for kids and they just did whatever they could with it.What audience is this movie for?  I can only think of 1214 year olds.  If you are older than 14 you will have serious problems with this movie.  It is not only slow, but it is so utterly boring.  The characters are overacted not just a little either and so stereotyped it is fun for a while..but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen.  You know everything that is going to happen too, cause yes...you have seen it a BILLION times before in any hero series on TV for kids.  I picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced.  It is so bad..so wrong..so...crap.But OK, we did get a laugh now and then.  Not just at the silly plot holes, but some scenes where worth a replay or two...or one scene that is, where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys..It is really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly.  Still makes me grin when I think about it.  But that only happened one more time sadly..and that is when the badass gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully...that and one comment They spring from the ground like some DEMONIC TROUT!  At this point we where almost crying with laughter.  But after that..nothing could ever top that..?.. so it is pretty much downhill from there.  So tops here are demonic trouts and overacting.  If anybody ever tells you this is a good movie...he is either a plant, vegetable or someone very evil.  This movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far.  Looking forward to seeing Tremors 3, it is bound to be box office hit compared to this...this...goosebumps no..I will leave it at that.",
		"Just a few words....  This movie really sucks.  It is bad cast It is amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the III.  Do not waste your time watching this crap, even if you like the tremors movies.",

		"Warning This review contains minor spoilers.Well the writers of the first Tremors are officially out of ideas.  I am first movie I am first movie Tremors 4 The Legends Begins, however, is a very dull movie.  Where the heck are the Graboids???  Due to the relative lack of Graboids through the first 90 minutes I am convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a character study.  Unfortunately there is not one interesting character in the movie except for Billy Dragos character who is given too few lines, too little to do and in the end too little screen time.  What saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer.  Whenever there was not any action on the screen you could rest assured that Burt Gummer was going to be interesting to listen too andor watch.  However in this movie Gross plays Hiram Gummer a very poor and boring substitute.  On the plus side when the Graboids Dirt Dragons in this movie are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets.I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long.  Pretty good for straight to video.  But after watching it I am sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long.  There are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and does not further the plot any.  Was there a rush to get this movie made?  I think not, more time could have and should have been spent on the script.I thought I had hit a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 packaged for sale with....Tremors!!!  What luck I thought, pay for 4 get 1 for free.  Well after watching Tremors 4 I like to think I paid for the original and got this mess for free, I cannot imagine paying a single dime for Tremors 4.  For fans of the series it is best to forget that Tremors 4 The Legend Begins even exists.Tremors 4 The Legend Begins rates a 3 out of 10.",

Your characters must have a motivation.  Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is not character development.  That is a plot contrivance.Stay away from this movie.  Or at the very least, watch it muted.  you see male lookatme",

		"How many more of those fake slice of life movies need to be made?  Hopefully not too many.Raising Victor Vargas is a very selfconscious attempt by the director Peter Solett at garnering the attention of Hollywood.  Nothing wrong with that in general.  it ignores independent production.It All that you are left with is a very selfconscious attempt at impressing Hollywood that will not impress anyone outside of the rarefied indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film.",
		"I know standard part To be honest, I wish I had not bothered.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt; generally I do not like to stop watching a film half way through.  This was an exception.  It was really, really, excruciatingly, sickeningly dull.  This film was possibly the slowest thing I have ever watched imagine a dopedup snail in space, and really did not do it for me.  The art was alright; the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee, yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced.I am not going to go into huge details about the storyline; basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area.  Generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment, it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across.  For me, I kind of wished that they would get gassed, not because I am a horrible sadistic person, but because the characters were uninspiring, annoying, dull and generally quite rude oh I am so terribly English.  I found that I was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film, and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened, and even that was a terrible anticlimax.If I were to praise it in any way, I would have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite wellmeaning.  Maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy, but the message it is trying to put forth is good in its nature.  The musical score was not bad, too.So, to conclude, this film is pretty poor.  I could not watch it the whole way through, or I would probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom.  Granted, it is not Torque bad, but it still does not rate highly in my eyes, so I have given it a 210.Hope this helps.",

But the mushy ending?  I always watch films and shows these days with the timer hidden, so I never know how much time is left until the end.

Do not get me wrong, I am all for older women with younger men.  The more power to them.

What kind of a past did the last five Cylons have, and how did they survive, or were they reincarnations?  Questions everywhere, answers nowhere.And then comes the end.

		"Did I step in something or is that bad smell coming from Daybreak 1  2?  God was behind everything?  What has God got to do with SciFi?  God is sensible explanation In fact, this is exactly the problem with the series finale  they obviously could not think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how Kara Thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper, how her old viper and charred body ended up on Earth 2, why Baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head, why 6 has an imaginary Baltar in her head, etc. so they explain it with angels or just do not explain it at all.The plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a Basestar through.

		"With these people faking so many shots, using old footage, and gassing animals to get them out, not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors, what is to believe?  Old film of countries is nice, but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films.  racism is old films I know old films Portrayed as fliers, they never flew their planes, Martin Johnson was an exvaudevillian, used friends like Jack London for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties, denying his wifes apparent depression, using her as a cute prop, all this makes these films unbearable.  They were by no means the first to travel to these lands, or the first to write about them.  He was OK as a filmmaker and photographer, but that is about it.",
		"The 1930s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world, with an emphasis on wild animals, exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures.  Despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place, and then bringing em back alive with the film footage, such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional Hollywood features ... because there were no expensive sets, costumes, or highpriced movie stars.The most successful makers of such films artistically and financially were the team of Martin E.  Johnson and his wife Osa, who made several documentaries sometimes with blatantly staged events in Africa and Asia.  The Johnsons safari films were extremely popular, inspiring several parodies ... most notably Wheeler  Woolseys So This is Africa, in which the very sexy Esther Muir plays a character named Mrs.  JohnsonMartini instead of Martin E.  Johnson, geddit?.  Although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time, the Johnsons films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour.  Viewed from our own more enlightened I hope standpoint, this is a serious flaw in the Johnsons documentaries there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana Johnson and his wife.One definite asset of these movies is the presence of Osa Johnson.  Ten years younger than her husband, she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter.  While certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond Esther Muir, Osa Johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she coproduced with her husband.Congorilla is probably the best of the Johnsons films.  The shots of the Congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in 1930.  The shots of the Pygmies and other natives are also interesting, although these suffer from the Johnsons penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look wild and alien.The best and funniest scene in Congorilla is an improvised sequence in which Osa Johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some Pygmy women.  The dance is the Black Bottom, no less ... the same dance which Bob Hope famously taught to Daisy and Violet Hilton, the conjoined twins.  she does high steps Meanwhile, they just stand there staring at her, apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish.  It is a very funny scene, but it has unpleasant undertones.  Osa Johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black Americans the implication seems to be that black Africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration using natural rhythm, I guess because it is in their blood, or something.I will rate Congorilla 4 points out of 10.  This film says a little bit about African life in the 1930s and rather more about American cultural perceptions in that same decade.",

Poor plot.  Poor acting.  Worse writing and delivery.  The special effects are dismal.  As much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke, the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible.  If we consider the action portions, well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan.  This movie only contains the latter kind.  This leaves little left.  I am glad I I am glad I I had no expectations, but was somewhat worried going in.  Yet, like a train wreck, one cannot merely look away.  And even with no expectations, I was let down.  Bad.  Not even so bad, it is good material.

		"I stopped comic relief But then I realized I could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more!  Whatever respect I might have had for Samuel Jackson has been irreversibly destroyed.  And Hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are.  When I was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun.  The only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay.  And no amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can change that.This movie is not worth a trip to Blockbuster.  Be warned if you pay for it, the only victim is your dumb ass.If you want to be really scared, I suggest the Descent.  If you want humor, go to your local stand up comedy club.  Their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash.",

I am shocked to say I actually think Anaconda was more fun.

		"Oh Dear Lord, How on Earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone?  it is good cheese It reeks good cheese It is the scummiest, moldiest, most tasteless cheese there is, and I cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually, truly enjoyed it.  Yes, if you saw it with a load of drunkstoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way, but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen.  I watched it with an upforafewlaughs guy, having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the films expected crapness.  We got the crapness plenty of it, but not the chuckles.  It does not even qualify as a sobadit isgood movie.  It is just plain bad.  Very, very bad.  Heres why look away if you are spoilerphobic The movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death.  OK, I was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was, but I think I grasped the this guy is a bit of a badass who you do not want to mess with message behind the ingenious scene.  Oh, and a guy witnesses it.  So, we already have our ultraevil bad guy, and wussy but cute apparently good guy.  Cue Hero.  Big Sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion, saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish, i.e.  Hero is immune to bullets, everyone else falls over rather clumsily.  Cue first plot hole.  How the bloody hell did Sammy know where this guy was, or that he would watched the murder.  Perhaps this, and the answers to all my plothole related questions, was explained in the 2 minutes before I got into the cinema, but I doubt it.  In fact, I am going to stop poking holes in the plot right here, lest I turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese which we all know is good cheese.  So, the plot a very generous word to use.  Good guy must get to LA, evil guy would rather he did not, Hero Sam stands between the two.  Cue scenery for the next vomitinducing hour  the passenger plane.  As I said, no more poking at plot holes, I will just leave it there.  Passenger plane.  Next, the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie, and what makes it everything it is  Snakes.  Yay!  Oh, pause.  First we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have.  Hot, horny couple see if you can guess how they die, deadbeforeanysnakesevenappear British guy those pesky Brits, eh? , cute kids, and Jo Brand.  For all you Americans that is an English comic famous for her size and unattractiveness.  Now that we have met the cast, let us watch all of them die except of course the cute kids.  Do not expect anything original, it is just snake bites on various and everincreasingly hilarious really not parts of the body.  Use your imagination, since the filmmakers obviously did not use theirs.So, that is most of the film wrapped up, so now for the best bit, the ending.  As expected, everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face.  Yep, Icecool Sammy included.  But wait, we are not all off the plane yet!  The last guy to get off is good guy, but just as he does he gets bitten by a you guessed it snake of all things.  Clearly this one had been hiding in Mr.  Jacksons hair the whole time, since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier, despite the 200ft constrictor the one that ate that pesky British bugger being unable to.  So, Sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop.  At this point I prayed that the movie was about to make a muchneeded Uturn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort.  But no.  In a kind of icing on the cake way but with stale cheese, remember, it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest.  How anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago, let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me, but it did well in summing up the film.Actually, we are not quite done yet.  After everyone has sucked face Uncle Sam with leading actress, good guy with Tiffany, token Black guy with token White girl, and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia, it is time for good guy and hero to get it on....In Bali!!!  Nope, it was not at all exciting, the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll.  Yes, the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred, and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times.  That is it.  This is the first time I have ever posted a movie review, but I felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography.  If you like planes, snakes, Samuel L.Jackson, air hostesses, bad guys, surfing, dogs in bags or English people, then please, please do not see this movie.  It will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you will never want to come into contact with any of them ever again.  Go see United 93 instead.  THAT was good.",

How anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago, let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me, but it did well in summing up the film.Actually, we are not quite done yet.  After everyone has sucked face Uncle Sam with leading actress, good guy with Tiffany, token Black guy with token White girl, and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia, it is time for good guy and hero to get it on....In Bali!!!  Nope, it was not at all exciting, the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll.  Yes, the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred, and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times.  That is it.  This is the first time I have ever posted a movie review, but I felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography.  If you like planes, snakes, Samuel L.Jackson, air hostesses, bad guys, surfing, dogs in bags or English people, then please, please do not see this movie.  It will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you will never want to come into contact with any of them ever again.  Go see United 93 instead.  THAT was good.",
		"Oh Dear Lord, How on Earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone?  It reeks of cheese from start to finish, but it is not even good cheese.  It is the scummiest, moldiest, most tasteless cheese there is, and I cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually, truly enjoyed it.  you saw drunkstoned buddies I watched it with an upforafewlaughs guy, having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the films expected crapness.  We got the crapness plenty of it, but not the chuckles.  It does not even qualify as a sobadit isgood movie.  It is just plain bad.  Very, very bad.  Heres why look away if you are spoilerphobic The movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death.  OK, I was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was, but I think I grasped the this guy is a bit of a badass who you do not want to mess with message behind the ingenious scene.  Oh, and a guy witnesses it.  So, we already have our ultraevil bad guy, and wussy but cute apparently good guy.  Cue Hero.  Big Sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion, saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish, i.e.  Hero is immune to bullets, everyone else falls over rather clumsily.  Cue first plot hole.  How the bloody hell did Sammy know where this guy was, or that he would watched the murder.  Perhaps this, and the answers to all my plothole related questions, was explained in the 2 minutes before I got into the cinema, but I doubt it.  In fact, I am going to stop poking holes in the plot right here, lest I turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese which we all know is good cheese.  So, the plot a very generous word to use.  Good guy must get to LA, evil guy would rather he did not, Hero Sam stands between the two.  Cue scenery for the next vomitinducing hour  the passenger plane.  As I said, no more poking at plot holes, I will just leave it there.  Passenger plane.  Next, the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie, and what makes it everything it is  Snakes.  Yay!  Oh, pause.  First we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have.  Hot, horny couple see if you can guess how they die, deadbeforeanysnakesevenappear British guy those pesky Brits, eh? , cute kids, and Jo Brand.  For all you Americans that is an English comic famous for her size and unattractiveness.  Now that we have met the cast, let us watch all of them die except of course the cute kids.  Do not expect anything original, it is just snake bites on various and everincreasingly hilarious really not parts of the body.  Use your imagination, since the filmmakers obviously did not use theirs.So, that is most of the film wrapped up, so now for the best bit, the ending.  As expected, everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face.  Yep, Icecool Sammy included.  But wait, we are not all off the plane yet!  The last guy to get off is good guy, but just as he does he gets bitten by a you guessed it snake of all things.

Yes, if you saw it with a load of drunkstoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way, but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen.  I watched it with an upforafewlaughs guy, having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the films expected crapness.  We got the crapness plenty of it, but not the chuckles.  It does not even qualify as a sobadit isgood movie.  It is just plain bad.  Very, very bad.  Heres why look away if you are spoilerphobic The movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death.  OK, I was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was, but I think I grasped the this guy is a bit of a badass who you do not want to mess with message behind the ingenious scene.  Oh, and a guy witnesses it.  So, we already have our ultraevil bad guy, and wussy but cute apparently good guy.  Cue Hero.  Big Sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion, saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish, i.e.  Hero is immune to bullets, everyone else falls over rather clumsily.  Cue first plot hole.  How the bloody hell did Sammy know where this guy was, or that he would watched the murder.  Perhaps this, and the answers to all my plothole related questions, was explained in the 2 minutes before I got into the cinema, but I doubt it.  In fact, I am going to stop poking holes in the plot right here, lest I turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese which we all know is good cheese.  So, the plot a very generous word to use.  Good guy must get to LA, evil guy would rather he did not, Hero Sam stands between the two.  Cue scenery for the next vomitinducing hour  the passenger plane.  As I said, no more poking at plot holes, I will just leave it there.  Passenger plane.  Next, the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie, and what makes it everything it is  Snakes.  Yay!  Oh, pause.  First we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have.  Hot, horny couple see if you can guess how they die, deadbeforeanysnakesevenappear British guy those pesky Brits, eh? , cute kids, and Jo Brand.  For all you Americans that is an English comic famous for her size and unattractiveness.  Now that we have met the cast, let us watch all of them die except of course the cute kids.  Do not expect anything original, it is just snake bites on various and everincreasingly hilarious really not parts of the body.  Use your imagination, since the filmmakers obviously did not use theirs.So, that is most of the film wrapped up, so now for the best bit, the ending.  As expected, everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face.  Yep, Icecool Sammy included.  But wait, we are not all off the plane yet!  The last guy to get off is good guy, but just as he does he gets bitten by a you guessed it snake of all things.  Clearly this one had been hiding in Mr.  Jacksons hair the whole time, since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier, despite the 200ft constrictor the one that ate that pesky British bugger being unable to.  So, Sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop.  At this point I prayed that the movie was about to make a muchneeded Uturn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort.  But no.  In a kind of icing on the cake way but with stale cheese, remember, it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest.  How anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago, let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me, but it did well in summing up the film.Actually, we are not quite done yet.  everyone has hot couple Nope, it was not at all exciting, the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll.  Yes, the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred, and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times.  That is it.  This is the first time I have ever posted a movie review, but I felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography.  If you like planes, snakes, Samuel L.Jackson, air hostesses, bad guys, surfing, dogs in bags or English people, then please, please do not see this movie.  It will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you will never want to come into contact with any of them ever again.  Go see United 93 instead.  THAT was good.",
		"This is not a film you can really analyse separately from it is production.  The audience became the filmmakers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the American film industry; we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend.  How is it possible to be objective?  This is our movie, is not it?  Or is it?  There may be nothing more disingenuous than a filmmaker who promotes himself as the audiences friend, giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them.

Well, thank god for us, because otherwise I might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snake.So, yes, I had fun at the movie  a midnight showing, fresh from the pub and with a bucket of icecream  but it actually had relatively little to do with the film, and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere.  Like Christmas, everyone seemed determined that they would have fun, no matter what.  There was laughter, but I do not know if it was with the film, or at the film.  With a film as calculated as this one, is that even a meaningful distinction?  There are some genuinely good aspects to the film.  Samuel L.  Jackson gives a welljudged performance, pure selfparody but with a real sense of pleasure.  Rachel Blanchard and Lin Shaye are decent in limited roles, and there are one or two inspired moments  the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulate.The stock characters are to be expected, but the total lack of suspense is not.

Only the annoying British man gets a decent pulpy death scene  the other killings are oddly flat.  The demise of the honeymoon couple, for instance, is shamefully botched.  Most of the actors fail to make an impression; it is a shame that a charismatic actress like Julianna Margulies should seem so tired when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a rollercoaster, she could be talking to the audience  the film falls far short.There are worse movies, but there are many, many better; another reviewer on this site compared this film with Lake Placid, and it is as apt a contrast as any I can think of.  That film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent, the jokes were funny, the suspense sequences were scary, and it was not devised by committee.  That the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus.  I do not need a postpub midnight showing to have a good time with that film.This film will, in time, fade to become a mere footnote in film history.  If it sets a precedent, however, I am genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time.  In all probability, nothing much will come of it.

		"Raising Victor Vargas is one of those light, family movies that you can watch and do the N.Y.  Times crossword same time And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a Corona, you do not have to Pause the DVD.  Just let it roll, ecause you will not be missing anything really important.  No twists, turns, or tension.  It is not really an ethnic movie, it is a movie about a poor, struggling immigrant family that happens to be Latino.  They could have been any ethnic group.  It made very little difference.  I have seen it all a zillion times before.  Just plug in a Jewish family, an Italian family, a Black family, or an Irish family.  Just the accents and names were different.  If the Vargas family was named Bush or Clinton and were Presbyterians, the movie would have been a total snooze.  It is funny that the critics here could not get the locale straight.  Some said it was Spanish Harlem.  Some the Bronx, and another Brooklyn.  As a lifelong New Yorker, I vote for the Lower East Side.  And it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other Latinos.  They lived in an insulatedisolated little enclave.  Some interaction with nonLatinos might have created some excitement, interest, or tension.  Remember West Side Story? And now for the oftcriticized cinematography.  I do not know if it was my TV or what, but all the indoor shots looked very ORANGE to me.  The apt, the furniture, and the faces were all ORANGE.  What was that supposed to mean?  And the apt. did look pretty cramped to me.  Somebody here mentioned that the old aptstenements had very big rooms.  Well, maybe 50 years ago.  What landlords have done is to break up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them.  And another annoying thing ....This is the second family movie I have seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy jerking off.  Is this private sex act necessary for us to watch?  Please spare me!  What is up with these directors?  So Victor Vargas is a pleasant little movie.  It was nice for a change to see young Latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents, which they did.  But the writers let them down, giving them a flat, unspectacular script to work with.  Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers near the fast forward button.",
