		"Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy.  It ran time as programs about school life My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell Highs satire is much closer to reality than is Teachers.  The scramble to survive financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew and their students.  When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at ..........  High.  A classic line INSPECTOR I am here to sack one of your teachers.  STUDENT Welcome to Bromwell High.  I expect that many adults of my age think that Bromwell High is far fetched.  What a pity that it is not!",
		"Homelessness or Houselessness as George Carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school, work, or vote for the matter.  Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism, the war on Iraq, pressuring kids to succeed, technology, the elections, inflation, or worrying if they will be next to end up on the streets.  But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home, the entertainment sets, a bathroom, pictures on the wall, a computer, and everything you once treasure to see what it is like to be homeless?  Bolt plays world until bet with Jeffery Tambor Bolt plays world until bet with Jeffery Tambor Bolt plays world until bet with Jeffery Tambor Bolt plays world until bet with Jeffery Tambor Bolt plays world until bet with Jeffery Tambor The bets on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he cannot step off the sidewalk.  He is given the nickname Pepto by a vagrant after it is written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of Molly Lesley Ann Warren an exdancer who got divorce before losing her home, and her pals Sailor Howard Morris and Fumes Teddy Wilson who are already used to the streets.  They are survivors.  Bolt is not.  He is not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it is fight or flight, kill or be killed.While the love connection between Molly and Bolt was not necessary to plot, I found Life Stinks to be one of Mel Brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy, it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or Spaceballs for the matter, to show what it is like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they do not know what to do with their money.  Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly money.Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others.",

		"This is easily the most underrated film inn the Brooks cannon.  Sure, its flawed.  It does homelessness unlike Citizen of lounge singers It does homelessness unlike Citizen of lounge singers Many of the jokes fall flat.  But still, this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not, and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive.  Its not The Fisher King, but its not crap, either.  My only complaint is that Brooks should have cast someone else in the lead I love Mel as a Director and Writer, not so much as a lead.",
		"THE NIGHT LISTENER 2006 12 Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Bobby Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Cullum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker.  Dir Patrick Stettner Hitchcockian suspenser gives Williams a standout lowkey performance.What is it about celebrities and fans?  What is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm?  In the latest derange fan scenario, based on true events no less, Williams stars as a talkradio personality named Gabriel No one, who reads stories he is penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named Pete Logand Culkin who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to No ones editor Ashe Morton who gives it to No one to read for himself.  No one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of Pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named Donna Collette giving an excellent performance who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with No one reveals that Pete is dying from AIDS.  apartment has tempest in he into Petes backgrounds apartment has tempest in he into Petes backgrounds apartment has tempest in he into Petes backgrounds It helps that Williams gives a standout, lowkey performance as the conflicted goodhearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him the one thing that has escaped his own reality and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy Collette whose one physical trait I will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core.However the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by Stettner, it pays to listen to your own inner voice be careful of what you hope for.",
		"You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade with perhaps the exception of Death To Smoochy, which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic.  The dramas he has made lately have been fantastic, especially Insomnia and One Hour Photo.  The Night Listener, despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release, is among his best work, period.This is a very chilling story, even though it does not include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter.  The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed.  In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result.  I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist.  When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker.  role was cry from she in Miss Sunshine There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me.  It takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it is this understated yet well reviewed role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an Academy Award as of 2008.  It is incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it is scary too.This is a good, dark film that I highly recommend.  Be prepared to be unsettled, though, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.",
		"There are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times.  Constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of Pyschosis, have kept psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades.  Occasionally, some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence.  That is the premise of the film entitled  The Night Listner.  evenings enthralling audiences with stories about Gay lifestyles It tells audiences with stories about Gay lifestyles Perhaps its because his show is losing it is authentic veneer which causes Noon to admit he is no longer himself.  Feeling abandoned by both his lover Jess Bobby Cannavale and his and best friend Joe Morton, he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation.  It is here, a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help.  Noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called Peter Rory Culkin.  In reading the boys harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents, Noon is captivated and wants to help.  However, things are not what they seem and Noon soon finds himself enwrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare.  This movie is pure Robin Williams and were it not for Toni Collette who plays Donna D.  Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop, this might be comical.  Instead, this may prove to be one of Williams more serious performances. ",

That is good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear.  It is bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and does not sewup any of the plot openings or backstory.  I would rather not go into any great detail except to say that,if you are not familiar with Mr.Maupins works or his personal story,you feel a little bit out of the loop here.  Still,the performances by Williams I would have loved to heard more of his narration,personally,Collette,Cannavale,Culkin and much of the supporting castthe Waitress at the restaurant Colletes Donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has! are topnotch and the mood established herenamely,the chilly,lonely dark exteriors of Wisconsin and New Yorkgive a terrific framing for this story.

		"I absolutely LOVED this film!  I do not at all relate to all the other comments I have read about it.  I was COMPLETELY enthralled through every second!  I found the story gripping, the acting intense, and the direction spoton.  I would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie.  I was edge through rest of my evening I found that there were so many perfect choices made...the casting, the script, the little bits of humor sprinkled in it.  There were so many points where the film could have gone for the cheap thrill, but it never did, and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately...and for the last number of years.",
		"This Night Listener is better than people are generally saying.  It has weaknesses, and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis, no doubt, but I think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this.  thing feels friend of friend of ghost stories One big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate.  Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility, and real life just sort of plods alongno?  So there are no flashy endings or earthshattering revelations, no showdown scenes.  Thank Heaven.  You have to get into the zone when watching this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a conventionallygood movie.  Williams is not terrific, but he easily meets the needs of the story, plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic No One as he is the Everyman, the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story.  Toni Collettes performance should be nominated for an Oscar even if she maybe should not win it.  Give it a shot.  For quality and content alone, The Night Listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days.",

		"What is inexplicable?  Firstly, the hatred towards this movie.  It may not be the greatest movie of all time, but gimme a break, it got 11 oscars for a reason, it made EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS for a reason.  It is a damn good movie.  Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it.  I have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when I saw it in theaters.  I have rewatched it on TV and video, and it had none of the impact it had when I saw it on the big screen twice, or maybe three times, actually.  But that might be it, the appeal of it.  it is spectacle in order of Ben Hur it is spectacle in order of Ben Hur it is spectacle in order of Ben Hur Now, Ben Hur and Gone With the Wind seem kinda hokey to me, with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama.  Not that Titanic has none of that.  Well, the acting was actually very good.  The melodrama was quite heavyhanded at times.But the reason Titanic works is that it is such an emotional ride.  I usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind, or give me a visual thrill.  This movie is not exactly dumb, but it is not cerebral at all.  The visual thrills are simply means to an end, to fuel the emotions of the audience.  I did not cry when Bambis mom died, I do not react to tearjerkers.  But this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million, an emotional rollercoaster that, if it were a regular one, would make Buzz Aldrin scream like a little girl.  And I am sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it, and have a ready supply of cynicism, then you can thoroughly dislike this movie.  But if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit, if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt, you will enjoy it completely.  And look at the top ten grossing films of all time.  Is a single one of them bad?  Is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10?  No, not even The Phantom Menace.  And this movie made 1.8 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide.  It cannot be bad.  Not possible. 1010.p.s. how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman?  spiderman was a fun movie, but it was a total 911 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did. it simply was not anything all that special. no one will remember it in 50 years. but i am pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.",
		"Previously, I wrote that I loved Titanic, cried at its ending many times over, and I am a guy in his 60s.  I also wondered about why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users.Well, I looked at the breakdown of the user ratings.  While 29.0 of all votes gave it a 10 rating, 10.7 gave it a 1 rating.  These 10.7 of these irrational imdb users, in effect, pulled the overall rating down to 7.0.  I blamed level on thing for Leonardo DiCaprio Believe me, I have tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men, mostly, who defame him left and right.  They absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part in giving him any credit in Titanic.  To answer one other user I am NOT talking about someone who just really does not like the movie that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc.  Everyone has, and is entitled to, hisher own taste.  But no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for Titanic, pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of Titanic to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point.  Heavens Gate 1980 was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing, and imdb voters ratings were 23.2 10 ratings and 9.2 1 ratings overall rating of 6.1.  Big Top Peewee 1988 got 4.3 10 ratings and 9.9 1 ratings overall rating of 4.5.  Cat People 1982 got 6.1 10 ratings and 2.6 1 ratings overall rating of 5.8.  Blind Date 1987 got 3.0 10 ratings and 2.8 1 ratings overall rating of 5.3.  Jumpin Jack Flash 1986 got 4.4 10 ratings and 3.7 1 ratings overall rating of 5.2.  WHAT DO ALL OF THESE FILMS HAVE IN COMMON WITH TITANIC?  ALL OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE LOWER !!!!  THAN TITANIC, AND NONE OF THESE STINKERS EVER WAS NOMINATED FOR A SINGLE AWARD.  Again, Titanic got 10.7 1 ratings!  Compare that to the other 5 movies I just mentioned.Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo factor?",
		"Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the illfated voyage on the unsinkable ship.  Cameron has thousands of lives in North Atlantic The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.  They make for a good onscreen couple.  DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable.  They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well.  The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film.  The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time.  The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation.  The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it is few flaws.  Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it.  The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg.  Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the illfated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.",
		"Titanic has to be one of my alltime favorite movies.  It has its problems what movies do not but still, it is enjoyable.When I stumble across someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is wait a minute, you do not?  I know so many people who do not like this movie, and I am not saying I do not see why.  The love story is too cheesy well, yes but is not it enjoyable and moving?  All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this does not actually exist.  But this is a movie, does not everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while?  The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors.  Well, OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials.  However I think it is unfair to say that they are terrible actors.  I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in.  But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.And finally, if one is going to complain that they do not like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I am sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things.  It is like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies.  I have movie save Lord of Rings trilogy.I I have movie save Lord of Rings trilogy.I I find movie save Lord of Rings trilogy.I I find movie save Lord of Rings trilogy.I I find movie save Lord of Rings trilogy.I I find movie save Lord of Rings trilogy.I The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it is an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults.  The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.I give this movie 1010, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it is an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.",
		"James Camerons Titanic is essentially a romantic adventure with visual grandeur and magnificence, a timeless tragic love story set against the background of this major historical event...  It is an astonishing movie that exemplifies hope, love and humanity...  Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific on screen with big charisma...  Conveying passion, trust, insouciance and ingenuity, he is a freespirited wanderer with artistic pretensions, and a zest for life...  Kate Winslet is absolutely lovely as the confused upperclass teen engaged to a nasty rich guy who finds herself, one night, plunged to the depths of despair...Billy Zane is an arrogant racist, abusive and ultra rich who would lie, cheat, steal, bribe with money or even use an innocent young child to escape defeat...  He keeps a 56 carat blue diamond worn by Louis XVI...Kathy Bates is the legendary unsinkable Molly Brown, the richest woman in Denver, who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship...Frances Fisheris is the impecunious cold snobbish mother who, deathly afraid of losing her social stature, forces her daughter to become engaged to marry a rich, supercilious snob...Victor Garber is the master shipbuilder, the reallife character who attempts to fix time, to measure it, in a sense, to make it into history...  Jonathan Hyde is the White Star Chairman who wants the Titanic to break the TransAtlantic speed record, in spite of warnings that icebergs may have floated into the hazardous northern crossing...Bill Paxton is the opportunistic undersea explorer in search for a very rare diamond called the Heart of the Ocean.  Gloria Stuart is the 101year old woman who reveals a neverbefore told love story...  The nightmare, the horror and the shock are imprinted upon her deeply lined face...

It is truly a moving tribute to those who lost their lives on that unfortunate ship...",
		"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense.  The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal Billy Zane.  Rose meets ticket aboard Titanic in poker game If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York.  Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson.  Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanics legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 1139, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanics many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too.  The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanics officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaires Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown.  As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss.  Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs.  Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr.  Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat.  In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware.  The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the PostVictorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to new money such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes.  Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes.  Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society.  Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.  The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives.  Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night.  In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.

		"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense.  The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal Billy Zane.  Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack Leonardo DiCaprio, a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  Titanic went voyage across Atlantic for New York Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson.  Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanics legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 1139, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanics many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too.  The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanics officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaires Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown.  As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss.  Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs.  Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr.  Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat.  In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware.  The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the PostVictorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to new money such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes.  Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes.  Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society.  Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.  The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives.  Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night.  In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.  At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic.  Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it does not take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture.  Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing.

The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat.  In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware.  The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the PostVictorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to new money such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had dinner by figure as dining scenes Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes.  Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society.  Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.  The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives.  Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night.  In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.  At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic.  Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it does not take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture.  Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing.  If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.",
		"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense.  The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal Billy Zane.  Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack Leonardo DiCaprio, a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York.  Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson.  Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanics legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 1139, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanics many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too.  The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanics officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaires Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown.  As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss.  Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs.  Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr.  Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat.

Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes.  Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes.  Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society.

		"To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it?  IF you missed the point of this beyondbeautiful movie, that is your loss.  The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think.  I am thousands of movies in my life I am thousands of movies in my life It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night.  It is the most amazing love story ever attempted.  I know that it is the cynical 90s and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on.  Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money!  How lame is that?  It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet.  I will gladly side with the majority this time around.  Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.",
		"Every once in a while the conversation will turn to favorite movies.  I will mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker.  I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie.  And they are too embarrassed now to admit it.I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time.  Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years.  I cried again.... in all the same places.  It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time.  A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall yes, even more than Star Wars.  And today, many people will not even admit they enjoyed it.  Folks, let us get something straight  you do not look cool when you badmouth this film.  You look like an out of touch cynic.No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults.  Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly.  However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful.  Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation.  you see him in Gangs of New York you see him in Gangs of New York Kate Winslet was so strong in this film.  The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic.  The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night.  How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me.  I was utterly transfixed.This film is one memorable scene after another.  Titanic leaving port in Southampton.  Rose and Jack at the bow, flying.  Iceberg, right ahead!  The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean.  The screams of the doomed after she went down.  And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.The music, which has also been a victim of the films success, was a key ingredient.  James Horners score was simply perfect.  And the love theme was beautiful and tragic.  Too bad Celine Dions pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.I confess, I am a Titanic buff.  As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it  in all its beauty.  Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I have had such an interest in the ship all my life.  However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs.  I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy.  The film was made with such humanity.Another reviewer said it better than I ever could Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.",

		"After a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted, urban, turn of the century Australian street, we meet Julie Rebecca Gibney and Peter John Adam as they go out house hunting.  They manage loan for fixerupper on Sydney street They manage loan for fixerupper on Sydney street It just may be haunted.13 Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clich?d story with good to average direction by Catherine Millar into a slightly above average shocker.The biggest flaws seem partially due to budget, but not wholly excusable to that hurdle.  A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film.  The opening thriller scene features some wonky editing.  Freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there is not much action.  Suspense should be created from staging, not fancy fix it in the mix techniques.  There is great atmosphere in the scene from the location, the lighting, the fog and such, but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim, cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street, showing their increasing proximity.  The tracking and the cuts need to be slow.  The attack needed to be longer, clearer and better blocked.  As it stands, the scene has a strong made for television feel, and a low budget one at that.After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves.  The story has a lot of similarities to The Amityville Horror 1979, though the budget forces a much subtler approach.  Millar and scriptwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios, often dramatic in nature instead of special effectsoriented, such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron, which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall.For some horror fans, the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama.  At least the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in.  But Morphett writes fine, intelligent dialogue.  The material is done well enough that it is often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise laterespecially if you have gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house.Once they get settled and things begin to get weirder, even though the special effects often leave much to be desired, the ideas are good.  The performances help create tension.  There is not an abundance of death and destruction in the filmthere is more of an abundance of home repair nightmares.  But neither menace is really the point.The point is human relationships.  There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting.  The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it.  That it is in a posh neighborhood, and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies, shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe, such as money or health problems.  Peters character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal workbased friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive, scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful.  At the same time, we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be.  Julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown, but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship.Although 13 Gantry Row never quite transcends its madefortelevision clunkiness, as a TV movie, this is a pretty good one, with admirable ambitions.  Anyone fond of haunted house films, psycho films or horrorthrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy.  It certainly is not worth spending 30 for a DVD that was the price my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling, but it is worth a rental, and it is definitely worth watching for free.",

		"I admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of hisher reluctant guardian.  I have seen enough of them  Baby Boom, Kolya, About a Boy, Mostly Martha, and to some extent, Whale Rider  to expect to be bored by the formula.  What held my attention in The King of Masks was the grimness of the setting smalltown China in the 1930s.  Extreme poverty was the norm, and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market.  When Wang discovers his purchased grandson, whom he is nicknamed Doggie, is a granddaughter, he initially casts her out, even though she is showed great promise as streetperforming heir.  Even after he reluctantly takes her back, he is not too upset when she is kidnapped.  The film is gritty then, showing the lengths to which a young, streetsmart girl had to go to survive in that society.The two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context.  In a Western society, one would expect at least a hint of resentment from Wang at not having achieved more material success.  Wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status, though, that I did, too.  While Doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern, suburban child, it is completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage.  Wang makes life in naturalness of lead actors",

Its a long story which has been edited so well that the length of the film is just 91 minutes.  A total satisfaction.  For five minutes it is an artistic film, next five minutes its a sad film, next five minutes its a thriller.  It just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face.

		"Robert A.  Heinleins classic novel Starship Troopers has been messed around with in recent years, in everything to Paul Verhoevens 1997 film to a TV series, to a number of games.  But none of these, so to speak, has really captured the spirit of his novel.  The games are usually unrelated, the TV series was more of a spin off, and the less said about Verhoevens film, the better.  Little do most know, however, that in Japan, an animated adaptation had already been done, released the year of Heinleins death.  series is presence of something of Verhoevens film Like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, though we see a fair amount of each.  While events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the books plot is present.  Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it is only slightly more touched upon than in the book.  While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book it gets a bit of the anime treatment, but what did you expect? , but it is far superior to the film.  Heinleins political views are merely excised, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed.  The big payoff of the series, however, is the climatic battle on Klendathu between the troopers and the bugsaliens, which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.Overall, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein.  And I think they did pretty well with this.  If you can find this series, give it a look.",

		"This is a lot of silliness about a woman from London who marries a tea planter from Ceylon whom she barely knows.  It is full of cliches, and the Liz Taylor character is not believable.  It has a marvelous set, some exotic location footage.  It shows Taylor at height of her beauty She looks stunning.",
		"ELEPHANT WALK may not be the acme of literature or of film, but it is great entertainment in the quasimelodramatic mode.  It is the story of love, both genuine and illicit, as well as overweening ambition, devotion, and the arrogance of personal tyranny.  A previous reviewer, John Mankin, questions why the central focus of the film, the mansion called Elephant Walk, should have been built by the former owner, the governor the late Tom Wiley, right across the elephants traditional path to the major source of water, the river.  To miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film the hubris of man.  That his son, played by Peter Finch, should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father, is not unexpected, since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his fathers rowdy boys club as his role models.  The point of the father was that he was a selfmade man who would tame nature to his liking, and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated, but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd, and thus he would dominate his son and all around him, and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water.  Who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water?  This is the nexus of the film what will animals do to get water; what will humans do to get power or love?  Ceylon, todays Sri Lanka, is the huge island off the coast of India where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story, not just the expenses of Miss Taylor.  Were it not for this exotic location much of the film was shot in Ceylon, and the magnificent bungalow this would have been just another potboiler.  One must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place, as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the English immigrant conquerors that were part and parcel of the British raj.  It is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony, teak, and marble.  Not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved Jalees grille work window and doorway borders evidently specified by art directors J.  McMillan Johnson and Hal Pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island.  craftsmanship reveals blandishments of time of Miss Taylor As I said, it is not great literature nor even great film, but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today.This is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drivein, not on the home TV, so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camerawork and scope.",
		"The anime that got me hooked on anime...Set in the year 2010 hey, that is not too far away now!  the Earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence.  Seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists, the government of the fictional New Port City form the Tank Police to deal with the problem  cops with tanks!  Oh the insanity! The heroes of this series include the new recruit Leona Ozaki, a red haired Japanese woman yeah I know, they never match their distinctly Japanese names with a Japanese appearance who has just been drafted into the Tank Police and is quickly partnered with blond, blue eyed nice guy Al.  Leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of Tank Police Commander Charles Britain also known as Brenten, a big guy who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses, a big revolver and a bad temper.  Britain did not like having Leona join the Tank Police in the first place and her wrecking his Tiger Special a giant green monster tank does not exactly endear her to him, nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a minitank that she nicknames Bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare where the boys are more your size as he puts it.  There is also Specs, the bifocal genius, Bible quotingGod fearing Chaplain, purple MOhawked Mohican, and the pot bellied Chief, who is right on the edge thanks to the Mayor always yelling at him about the Tank Police antics.  Seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them, they are not very well liked by the people.The villains are a cyborg named Buaku who is got a mysterious past that is connected with a project known as Green Peace, his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks Anna  Uni Puma.  guys are samples from people by gas clouds guys are samples from people by gas clouds The story, however, was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic Manga book that is very hard to find.All sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred.  This is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it, you would better go get Quentin Tarantino.  Uneven in places but still a lot of fun.Followed by New Dominion Tank Police.",
		"Fact Stargate SG1 is a cheesy scifi TV series.There is no escaping facts.  How much you try to excuse yourself or explain it Stargate SG1 remains a cheesy scifi TV series.Stargate SG1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly.  Special FX are not nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action is not going to blow you out of the chair.  Or couch for that matter either.But, and this is where I really think Stargate SG1 deserves all the credit it can get, for each and every episode or stolen idea I think you can count at least one cheesy scifi movie that is actually worse than a one hour TV episode.In fact some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still have been better than most movies.And being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes Stargate SG1 special.I am very picky with my selections.

		"Scott Bartletts OffOn is nine minutes of pure craziness.  It is a fullfrontal assault of psychedelic, pulsating, epilepsyinducing flashing lights and colours, and the first true merging of film and video in avantegarde cinema.  There is no story to speak of, but Bartlett uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions, integrating these biological phenomena into the highlyindustrial form of modern technology.  In a sense, the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools, his machinery, his technology.  theme connects subplot of HAL9000 in Stanley Kubricks theme connects subplot of HAL9000 in Stanley Kubricks The visuals are richlycoloured, a confronting blend of sharp, vivid photography and increasinglygrainy video, as though we are sitting too close to a television screen {as a matter of fact, the end product was recorded from a TV monitor}.There appears to be some confusion about the films release date.  IMDb lists the film as a 1972 release, but both the National Film Registry and the National Film Preservation Foundation give 1968 as the correct year.  Perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the films completion and its first public screening.  Either way, the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time, occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video, and some brisk techno music would not have gone amiss, either!  OffOn captures grainy, fragmented images, presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information.  I had a thought  and please do not laugh at this freethinking interpretation  that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing Earths television signals might very well receive such a disjointed, alien documentation of human life, a bizarre montage of only vaguelyfamiliar imagery that could not possibly make any coherent sense.  Perhaps this is where Mankind, with all his technology, is eventually heading, towards an irreversible merging of film and video, of purity and artificiality.",

		"The performance by Om Puri, Smita Patil, and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely, along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by Govind Nihlani.  The dialogues by Vijay Tendulkar is also great.  I have not seen another movie like this.  It is one whole, each piece so nicely fit in the plot.  You cannot not be impressed by this movie.  Amrish Puri comes off as the bossy husband and baap of Om Puri.  Om Puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system.  Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain.  The first meeting of Anand Velankar with Rama Shettys at Sadhashivs place is absoulely stunning.  Smita Patil does not play a main role, but her part is also not distracting from the main plot.  Inamdar plays role of terms with its workings Saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble.  He is also the guru of Om Puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble.The movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody.  Om Puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya.  A treat to all avid fans of Indian cinema.",

Resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms  bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.The Spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system.

		"I loved this film.  Not being a swooning Ed Wood Jr. fan, I prefer to appreciate his boundless enthusiasm and acknowledge his shortcomings.  His movies are fun, but his personal story is one racked with pain.  I hoped, and was delighted to find, that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life, rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise.  From beginning to end, this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology, leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to Ed Wood Jr.What we get are people who knew Ed Wood the best talking about him from all perspectives, positive and negative, and showing us their character as much as Eds.  We get insight into Eds from his romances The set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background.Fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding Ed Wood controversies, and new comers will be amazed that this man was real.  The DVD is full of impossible to find gems Crossroads of Lorado and photo galleries, but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story.Ed Wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him for better or worse, to the point where one woman will go down in history as Swimming Pool Owner for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool.  This ability to define a persons legacy comes through universally, as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was Ed Wood Jr., but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created.  Somehow, without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time, the connection that Ed Wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement.Even the title hints at the Blist horror genre, but by the end, we see that even this is a kindness.  What begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with Woods legend.In many ways a living contradiction, Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed to a single viewpoint.  This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get.  Being itself a juxtaposition of themes, it is at once respectful, provocative, thoughtful, gripping, fun, sad, kind, and fulfilling.",

It rounds up his surviving entourage, many of whom have passed away since filming, and gives an honest examination of Ed Wood and his work.  Nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear Hollywood, sentimental in its treatment of the director down to the haunting music, this documentary is an absolute mustsee for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day.

It makes Clockwork Orange which was banned for years in the UK look like a Disney cartoon.Should you see this film?  YES It is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of Asian cinema.  The shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters.  If you like this make sure you catch Dead or Alive which is very similar barring the insane ending in DOA of course.  they have talent like Miike at Takeshi Kitano The best chance of seeing this film outside a Takashi Miike retrospective at a film festival is on DVD.

It is a yakuzatriad picture, involving cops versus Japanese or Chinese gangsters mostly Chinese, as the title suggests, but already even in his first technical debut, Takashi Miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from hereon in.  Social issues like black market trading of precious goods, in this case human organs usually from children; nostalgia for childhood and ones roots, which was especially prevalent in Dead or Alive 2; thumbingofthenose at taboos like gay sex and satirical rapeviolence towards women; bloodcurdling violence.  It is certainly not as surreal as some of Miikes most recent films, but this is expected as he is trying out things that he is just starting to learn, following a track record of straight to video programmers.  It is got all of those qualities, and it is also, like the films that would follow from it, equally savage and heartfelt, crazy in spots and sardonic in its drama, and solid for genre fans.The story concerns two brothers, one a Chinese orphan raised in Japan, Tatsuhito Kiriya Kippei Shiina, pretty decent as a Eastwoodesquire antiherohero, who is become a detective, and another, who is become a gangster, or a wouldbe one.  gang represents wacko with terror in his eyes gang represents wacko with terror in his eyes gang represents wacko with terror in his eyes There is some intrigue involving the organtrading scheme with the gangsters, which Kiriya almost becomes a victim of, and the gangs penchant for gay sex at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want.  It all leads up to vengeance and redemption, qualities that Miike and his writer are trying to emulate from Shakespeare hence the Macbeth bit with Wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying it will not come off.If it does not add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great Shakespeare play would have, it is par for the course of a film like this.  Miikes goals are met, though just met, in his lowscale ambitions a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents, notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime, and what the realm of unrepentant sex, with both sexes, brings out psychologically in the characters.  At the same time, Shinjuku Triad Society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting blackcomedy from the Miike oeuvre.  Some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness, like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face, or the randomness of the interrogation as it goes into a very twisted area.  There is even a laughoutloud line from the young sexslave after finishing an act on one of the bosses Thank you, Mr.  WeenyBurger.  Miike and his writer do not have enough here to make the film a fullon dark comedy like Ichi or, of course, Visitor Q, but there is enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters.As the first entry of the Black Society trilogy, as it is called, I was quite impressed, and it is a fine quasicalling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema.",

		"This movie is the first of Miikes triad society trilogy, and the trilogy kicks of to a great start.  The movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically, and these themes are actually apparent in all his films, if you look close enough.  cop trying brother from their of Tokyos yakuza The kid brother is a lawyer, and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one, as the movie progresses.  The movie takes place in a very harsh environment, and is therefore pretty violent and tough.  Miike has done worse, but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard.  As usual there is also a lot of perverted sex, mostly homosexual in this one.  The movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie, but with a great drive and true grittiness.  If you have only seen Miikes farout movies Ichi the killer, Fudoh etc. this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive overthetop style displayed in those movies and his more serious side, as seen in the other films of the trilogy.  And as always with Miike, there are at least two scenes in this that you will NEVER forget see it and figure out which ones for yourself.810",

		"Masters of Horror Right to Die starts late one night as married couple Abby Julia Anderson  Ciff Addison Martin Donovan are driving home, however while talking Cliff is distracted  crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road.  Cliffs airbag works OK  he walks away with minor injuries, unfortunately for Abby hers did not  she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car  doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body.  Abbys life is saved, just.  She is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured  horribly disfigured from the burns.  Cliff decides that she should die, his selfish lawyer Ira Corbin Bersen thinks they should let Abby die, sue the car manufacturer  get rich while Abbys mum Pam Linda Sorenson wants to blame Cliff, get rich  save Abby.  However Abby has other plans of her own...This American Canadian coproduction was directed by Rob Schmidt whose only horror film previously was Wrong Turn 2003 which on it is own hardly qualifies him to direct a Masters of Horror episode  was episode 9 from season 2 of the Masters of Horror TV series, while I did not think Right to Die was the best Masters of Horror episode I have seen I thought it was a decent enough effort all the same  still does not come close to being as bad as The Screwfly Solution 2006.  it becomes drama as wrangling over Abbys life it goes drama as wrangling over Abbys life it goes drama as wrangling over Abbys life it goes drama as wrangling over Abbys life it uses drama as wrangling over Abbys life it uses drama as wrangling over Abbys life The characters are a bit clich?d, the weak man, the bent lawyer, the protective mum  the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough, the dialogue is OK, the story moves along at a nice pace  overall I liked Right to Die apart from a few minutes here  there where it loses it is focus a bit  I was not that keen on the ambiguous ending.Director Schmidt does a good job  there are some effective scenes, this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere  outandout blood  gore.  There are some fantastic special makeup effects as usual, there is shots of Abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body  the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross images  makeup effects that reminded me of similar scenes in Hellraiser 1987  it is sequels, then there is the main course at the end where Cliff literally skins someone complete with closeups of scalpels slicing skin open  him peeling it off the muscle  putting it into a cooler box!  Very messy.  There are also various assorted body parts.  There is some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked...Technically Right to Die is excellent, the special effects are brilliant  as most Masters of Horror episodes it does not look like a cheap madeforTV show which basically if the truth be told it is.  The acting was fine but there is no big names in this one.Right to Die is another enjoyable  somewhat twisted Masters of Horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene!  Well worth a watch... for those with the stomach.",
		"he made season of Masters of Horror franchise fact is season of Masters of Horror franchise fact is season of Masters of Horror franchise There was a similar underdog story in season one, when William Malone made on of the best episodes with The Fair Haired Child even though his other long feature films Fear Dot Com and House on Haunted Hill sucked pretty badly.The story of Right to Die cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia, but thankfully also features multiple oldfashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance, murderous conspiracies, pitch black humor and comic book styled violence.  Whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husbands continuous adultery, the Addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident.  Cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife Abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially.  Whilst Cliff and his sleazy attorney Corbin Bernsen of The Dentist want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor, Abbeys mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on Cliff.  Meanwhile Abbeys hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in Cliffs surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices.  After a few victims, Cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well.  Right to Die is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff I always hoped to see from a TVseries concept like Masters of Horror.  It is violent and gory with a sick  twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences.  The euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well, yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons.  The atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling.  Actresses Julia Anderson and Robin Sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks, which is always a welcome plus, and Corbin Bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a meanspirited and egocentric bastard.  Great MoH episode; definitely one of the highlights of both seasons.",
		"Fans of the HBO series Tales From the Crypt are going to love this MOH episode.  Those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic EC comics were based on, will recognize this one right off the bat.Underrated indie favorite Martin Donovan also an excellent writer  coauthor of the screenplays for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOMES HER is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way.  He could play a really nice if misunderstood guynextdoor, or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness.  In the case of RIGHT TO DIE, he takes the latter approach, and it definitely works.Donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist Robin Sydney, much to the displeasure of his inconsolable, unforgiving spouse, Abbey Julia Anderson.  he is plug on her from Corbin Bernsen But Abbeys never been one to give up without a fight, and that is where the ECtheme of the episode comes in.  Cuckolded husbands  and wives  have always been the genres favorite subject matter for some spooky and OOKY supernatural shenanigans, and this case is definitely no exception.  If anything, the rampedup quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere.And that is not to mention that John Espositos original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist.  You do not realize as you are watching that you only know half the story, until close to the end...think WHAT LIES BENEATH with more guts and gazongas, and you are there.Not a bad effort, but not the best of the lot, either.  At least Rob Schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction, especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed!  As with most MOH episodes, this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment, so the extremely squeamish need not apply.",

		"I wait for each new episode, each rerun with anticipation!  The new look of scifi created by Stargate SG1 is a wonder that I hope will never end.

I love tantrums in his as Jack ONeill I love tantrums in his as Jack ONeill I wish tantrums in his as Jack ONeill The other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner, season after season.  You cancel this program in the next three years, and you make a serious mistake.  Also, you need a bigger role for the Asgard  they are just too cool.",

I translated it for generation of TV watchers in reference to the nosy neighbor on Bewitched.However, when you see the result of gossip in the Pvt.  Snafu short Rumors, you see that it is not quite a laughing matter.  In this case, the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the Axis Powers have attacked the United States.  So, he tells it to someone, who tells someone else, who tells someone else, and it continues.  As in The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming, the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time, so that when it gets back to Snafu...well, you know what I mean!  Yes, it is mostly WWII propaganda  complete with a derogatory term for the Japanese  but I have to say that the Pvt.  Snafu shorts were actually quite funny.  Of course, since they had Dr.  Seuss writing and Mel Blanc providing the voices, it is no surprise that these came out rather cool.  Worth seeing.",

		"Indian Directors have it tough, They have to compete with movies like Laggan where 11 henpecked,Castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots.  Devdas, a hapless, fedar festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion, with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any ones feelings or sentimentsalas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry.  But to make a good movie, you have to tightrope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with Split skirts and DishumDishum fights preferably involving a nitwit Bollywood leading actor who is marginally handsome.  So you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of Leonine village head who in own words defending his Village this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience.  There are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like Nana Patekar Narasimhan.  Nana Patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the Politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him, meanwhile his daughter is bathing his Grandson.This is as authentic a scene you can get in rural India.  Patekar is school of breed in Hindi Films The violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with SongDances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies will not sell, a sad but true state of affairs.  Faster this changes better for Bollywood.  All said and done this is one good Movie.",
		"The beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mothers love, the exceptional performances, the steady execution and the quite innovative script.  film tells story of Nandini with kid Raja All of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in India of whom she had not even known is in troubles and the couple rush to India.  When they get into the village, Nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture; Shekhars family, ruled by his cruel, highly cynical and merciless father Narasimha, lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless.  Nandini starts nagging Shekhar to return home, but he is soon killed by his fathers enemies.  When she wants to leave, Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India.  Here starts the intense struggle which can be called Nandini vs.  Narasimha.India is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film, but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas, so it may be even correct.  The portrayal is in my view fair and not onesided because the positive side is also presented to an extent.  Such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world.  The locations are amazing, the music is wonderful, and Krishna Vamshis direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing.  One thing that must be noted is the very earpleasing background score by Ismail Darbar, it is beautiful.  The characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film.  Portrayed realistically throughout, the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch.  Its dialogues are superb and intelligently written, and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points, a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension.The films biggest strength is the performances.  Karisma Kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as Nandini.  Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible.  She displays so much intensity, impulsiveness, anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son.  Her outbreaks while facing off Nana Patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child.  After Fiza, this is her most powerful performance.  One of the greatest actors Indian cinema has seen, Nana Patekar is indescribable as Narasimha.  He manages to be hateful as Narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him.  Patekar displays cruelty, wittiness and even humanity with total conviction.  He is outstanding.  Another great performance comes unsurprisingly from Indias most underrated actress, Deepti Naval, who sensitises her character to perfection.  Sanjay Kapoor is just adequate and Shahrukh Khan provides great comic relief.  Anyway, do watch Shakti  it could have been better, but it is definitely a mustwatch.",
		"Uneven Bollywood drama.  Karisma Kapoor is excellent as an Indian woman in Canada who marries a friend Sanjay Kapoor, has a child, and then visits his family in India only to find they are terrorist warlords.  Drama and tragedy ensue, and the film becomes a kind of NOT WITHOUT MY BABY styled thriller.  dance is character for intensity of films drama dance is character for intensity of films drama Likewise, the inclusion of Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan as a happygolucky drifter who helps Kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce, and it only gets back on his feet when his character  and his fantasies about Rai that generate her cameo dance  are dispensed with.  His throwaway comicbook dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the films primary gripping drama.  The cast is nicely supported by Nana Patekar as the warlord, and the elegant Deepti Naval who is outstanding as his longsuffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the films best scenes; Ritu Shivpuri and Rajshree Solanki are also very good as Sanjays sisters in India, and very pleasing eye candy.  But Sanjay himself overacts terribly, especially during obvious adlibs.  The directorial style of writerdirector Krishna Wamsi is sloppy, rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts, although his camera movement is good.  The musical underscore is also quite effective, moody, featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble too bad little if any of that made it onto SHAKTIs soundtrack cd, but Bollywood has not yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums, at least not in most cases.  But SHAKTI is Karisma Kapoors film, all the way, though, and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to India contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with Sanjay in the initial Canadian scenes.  Despite the unevenness of much of the picture, Karismas performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures.  In a strange way, also, I found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty I would noticed in CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER and MARIE ANTOINETTE, both of which I would seen just prior, although SHAKTI of course is an entirely different kind of film; but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the austerity of terrorismcontrolled poverty in India rather than the elegance of Versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal Chinas Tang Dynasty  whose selfserving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext.",

Film is compelling, its few songdance numbers are uninteresting and needless, the gaity of Bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this films drama, at least once we have left the comforting confines of their Canadian love nest  although one number involving a cameo by the stunning Aishwarya Rai is enjoyably provocative, if ultimately misplaced as well.  Likewise, the inclusion of Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan as a happygolucky drifter who helps Kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce, and it only gets back on his feet when his character  and his fantasies about Rai that generate her cameo dance  are dispensed with.  His throwaway comicbook dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the films primary gripping drama.  The cast is nicely supported by Nana Patekar as the warlord, and the elegant Deepti Naval who is outstanding as his longsuffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the films best scenes; Ritu Shivpuri and Rajshree Solanki are also very good as Sanjays sisters in India, and very pleasing eye candy.  But Sanjay himself overacts terribly, especially during obvious adlibs.  The directorial style of writerdirector Krishna Wamsi is sloppy, rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts, although his camera movement is good.  Bollywood has value of score on soundtrack albums Bollywood has value of score on soundtrack albums But SHAKTI is Karisma Kapoors film, all the way, though, and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to India contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with Sanjay in the initial Canadian scenes.  Despite the unevenness of much of the picture, Karismas performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures.  In a strange way, also, I found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty I would noticed in CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER and MARIE ANTOINETTE, both of which I would seen just prior, although SHAKTI of course is an entirely different kind of film; but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the austerity of terrorismcontrolled poverty in India rather than the elegance of Versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal Chinas Tang Dynasty  whose selfserving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext.",

		"Baker is handful of actors than his material He is been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero, and has the type of strong, solid presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him.  Baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor, and that is what is so great about him.  He really seems to mean what he is saying, regardless of how clich?, obvious or silly, which puts him in a league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud.  It is what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy work so well, and that same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE.  This was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era.  By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there is a real timeless quality that does not jar you away from the action on screen.  To be honest, I have always enjoyed the films of Greydon Clark, who is a nononsense director in the same vein as 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his best.

		"As a kid, I loved this game.  I played it a zillion times during Spring 1993 with my friend Andrew.  I used to play Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored.  Then Streets of Rage 2 came out.  And we quickly forgot that this one even existed.You play as excops Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way.  There are 8 levels to work thru in a rundown and corrupt city led by the evil Mr X.  Beating up all the bad guys and the endoflevel boss is much fun.  Level 4 The Bridge was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river.  You even have the chance to become Mr.  Xs right hand man at the end of the game at a price.  This leads to the bad ending in which you become the the boss of the syndicate.  Exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to Mr.  X, but never mind.Streets of Rage also has truly fantastic music.  Koshiro did miracles with technology of Sega Genesis The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are standout tunes.  As a Wii owner I am proud to have this forever on my console.  But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete.ProsAverage graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comicbook like panel progression that fits the tone of the game.Great tunes.Easy to get into and hard to put down.ConsVastly inferior to the infinitely more complex Streets of Rage 2.Poor enemy AI.  Baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat.  This is especially infuriating with the Level 5 boss.Lack of combo moves.Lack of decent weapons.Bad guy models are repeated far too often.Graphics B Sound A Gameplay B Lasting Appeal B",
		"On Sunday July 27, 1997, the first episode of a new science fiction series called Stargate SG1 was broadcast on Showtime.  A spinoff of and sequel to the 1994 film Stargate starring Kurt Russell and James Spader, the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film.  For ten seasons, it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as SG1.  Originally, the series starred Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack ONeill two ls! , Michael Shanks as Dr.  Daniel Jackson, Amanda Tapping as Captain Samantha Carter, Christopher Judge as Tealc and Don S.  Davis as Major General George S.  Hammond.  For ten long years, we watched the team battle against the Goauld, the Replicators, the Ori and many other aggressors.  At the same time, they forged alliances with the Asgard, the Tokra, the rebel Jaffa, the Nox and the Tollan.  They saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up, not until death claimed them.  And sometimes not even then.As with all longrunning series, they were numerous cast changes.  Michael Shanks left the series in January 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor.  Daniel Jacksons successor as the teams resident archaeologistgeek was Jonas Quinn, an alien from a country called Kelowna on the planet Langara, played by Corin Nemec.  However, Shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in June 2003 and Nemec left at the same time.  Unfortunately, he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards.  Don S.  Davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in March 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go.  The show is original star and arguably its most popular actor, Richard Dean Anderson, starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons.  His participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons.  He finally left SG1 in March 2005 in order to spend more time with his then sixyearold daughter.  Jack ONeill was by far my favourite character in the series and, truth be told, I never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as I did the earlier episodes for that very reason.The ninth season represented a new era for the programme.  With the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the Goauld and the Replicators in Season Eight, many fans felt the series should go out on a high.  Regardless, the series carried on for a further two years with the Ori replacing the Goauld as the series main adversaries.  Three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this reinvention.  Ben Browder came in as the cocky Southern Air Force pilot Lt.  Colonel Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG1.  His Farscape costar, the lovely Claudia Black, began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious, sexy, hilarious and certainly extroverted Vala Mal Doran, a former Goauld host and con artist from another planet.  A recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons, she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season.  Rounding off the cast was the legendary Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry, the new commander of the SGC and an old friend of Jack ONeill and General Hammond.  For the last two years, they starred alongside the SG1 faithful Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the Stargate franchise.Alas, all good things must come to an end.  During the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of Season Ten, ratings dropped considerably, resulting in cancellation in its August 2006.  After ten seasons and 214 episodes, the dream was finally over.  On March 13, 2007, what began with Children of the Gods ended with Unending.  finale made Ireland before SciFi in United States It became the secondlongest running scifi series in the world, second only to Doctor Who 19631989, and the longestrunning American produced scifi series, having surpassed The XFiles only a few months before it ended.Stargate SG1 represents the cornerstone of the Stargate franchise.  In 2004, its success and popularity led to the production of a spinoff series entitled Stargate Atlantis, which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in August 2008.  Although plans for another feature film fell through, two directtoDVD films, Stargate The Ark of Truth and Stargate Continuum, were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future.  A third liveaction series, Stargate Universe, is also due to premiere at some point next year.  There was, unfortunately, an animated series, Stargate Infinity, which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better.  Despite the end of SG1 and Atlantis as continuing series, the future of Stargate looks very bright indeed.In conclusion, while Stargate has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major scifi television franchises such as Star Trek and Doctor Who, its still relatively new compared to those two scifi giants and I have every confidence that it will continue for many, many years to come.",
		"Stargate SG1 follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named SG1 through a device called the Stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole.Having seen this series sporadically for it is first few seasons when it first came out, I did not know how good this series would really be, 10 years after I had last seen an episode.  My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth.  Stargate SG1 is more than just a simple scifi series, it is one of the most well made, interesting, long running, exciting scifi ever produced.  And why?  Because it runs on an amazing premise.This series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and I think it is a very good example that television, as a medium, with a suitable premise, is able to provide something that does not work on the time restriction of film.  The sense of familiarity created by a long running series, watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief, and it is all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show.Stargate SG1 kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years, but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show  The first few seasons, perhaps up to the 4th5th, focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending Goauld threat.   From the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the Goauld and preventing attacks on Earth.  planets was sg1 in place of Goauldreplicatorori conflicts planets was sg1 in place of Goauldreplicatorori conflicts It has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned, but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments.   The 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no Jack ONeil.  They are both good continuations, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, because they seem to be about little more than SG1 and humanJaffa losing battle after battle to the Ori.Basically, after season 7, exploration was pushed to the background, which in many ways was a shame, because of the potential and mystery each planetepisode presented; on the other hand, it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were.Even tough I believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest, the feeling I have is that it could go on; the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer.  A last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome, but ultimately things are as they are.In the end, because of the fact that I enjoyed everything, it is a little hard to find that it ends.  The big picture, however, the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years, is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew, those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of SG1.",
		"Narratives  whether written, visual or poetic epics  generally try to avoid too may characters; readers and viewers, after all, can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who.  This is especially true in film, I think, simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema.  Viewers like myself, however, do not have that problem because we see all our films on DVD or VHS.A year ago I was introduced to Audrey Tautou, a French actress, whom I first saw in The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain 2001 and later in A Very Long Engagement 2004, both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters.  This earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways more characters and more complexity.Now, other directors have used those techniques before Robert Altman with The Player 1992, Short Cuts 1993, Gosford Park 2001 and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia 1999.  Kramer did it with comedy of epic proportions The difference with this film is, first the director lets us see inside the head of some of the characters and second, some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewers memory as the story flipflops between different time periods.The basic  the core, so to speak  story concerns a young woman, Irene Tautou who is told, by a fellow commuter on a train, that she will meet her true love on that day.  This occurs in the first few minutes of the film.  The clever irony at this point is that Irene does not realize that the young man opposite Gilbert Robin may be that one true love.  And, nor does he...They go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter.  However, chaos results throughout the rest of the day, not only for the two young people, but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere, and yet...If the story were simply that, it could tend to be boring, and even quite predictable.  Not so.  The script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too commonplace, but which are turned into believable, extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again.  For example, the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours, consider your alternatives; two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before Irene and her man of destiny meet again.  Or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen?  Consider again what would happen...All of that is interesting enough.  What was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was THE ONE for Irene, or whether it was, in fact, the young man on the train.  That kept me guessing for a while.I will let you think about that, should you see this delightful romp.Recommended for all.",

		"This whimsical film had the misfortune of being released at the same time of the highly popular Amelie, both having the wonderful Audrey Tautou playing the central role.  Laurent Firode, the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of France in recent memory.The film deals with chance, as its English title indicates.  The French title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the Atlantic as they fly, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects.  From the start, the director interlaces all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other, something that is hard to imagine, but in the films context seems to work well.A chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film.  Irene, who is going to work, is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her Zodiac sign is and proceeds to read from her paper.  Irene, it seems will cross paths and will find her soul mate that same day.  After Irene leaves the train, the quiet young man seated next to the woman tells her he has the same birth date as Irene.  It seems they are destined to one another from the start, but alas, they will not reconnect until the last frame of the film.Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene.  Faudel, who plays Younes, does not have a lot to do until the end, but he shows he has a presence and plays well his part.  cast makes light as butterfly by way humans",

Better still, we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yetis nipples, which causes it to harden and elicits a big, leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth ! ; the vixen nurses the yetis wounded hand while he makes googoo eyes at her, the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building, and the furry fellow even breaks a mans neck with his toes !!.  Overall, this singularly screwball and shamefully unheralded shouldbe camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectiously asinine celluloid lunacy that is eminently worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following.",
		"Being a giant monster fan, me seeing Yeti was an absolute must, especially after hearing so much about it.  Thanks to the good ol bootleg market I was able to find a copy pretty easily, and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually, dare I say, decent.Decent for what it is, actually, namely a cheesy giantmonster flick.  It kicks in pretty quickly as Yeti is found pretty much immediately, and we get introduced to various characters.  They consist of some sleazy ones, some good ones, and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy scifi film, by far.Yeti looks like a longhaired guy straight out of the original Woodstock concert, and really, he is not that bad of a dude, especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cagelike thing.  Godzilla he is not  despite his rude awakening, he does not even rampage actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture, but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out.  Yeti seems to understand English pretty nicely my copy was dubbed in English and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are.However, we want to see the giant Yeti do his thing, and he is pretty much in the whole movie, and in typical lowbudget fashion, he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there is even a bunch of the fake legs shots of him just standing there.Yes, the special effects are not the greatest, but there are definitely some good ones here.  he uses top of it with his foot he uses top of it with his foot Yeti smashes top of it with his foot Yeti smashes top of it with his foot Yeti smashes top of it with his foot Actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes Yetis nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an oh yeah baby manner.  But even this is not that bad, and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer.The movie is pretty long for this kind of thing, but surprisingly enough it does not get boring  the story is actually good, and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy.Yeti may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks, but it is definitely better than other King Kong 76 ripoffs like A.P.E. and Queen Kong by very far.",

		"Burning Paradise is a combination of neoShaw Brothers action and Ringo Lams urban cynicism.  When one watches the film, they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that does not matter, it is attitude and atmosphere that counts.  This great film has both!!  ShiKwanand puts them in Raiders of Ark setting ShiKwanand puts them in Raiders of Ark setting However, these are not the lighthearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a Jet Li movie.  Instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results.  What makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime, there is no holding back.  Too bad, they do not make films like this more often.",
		"This is one of the finest films to come out of Hong Kongs New Wave that began with Tsui Harks ZU Warriors of Magic Mountain.  Tsui set a tone for the New Waves approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the New Wave Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung, etc. accepted from then on as a given; namely, the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony, if not outright comedy.  Burning Paradise put a stop to all that, and with a vengeance.It is not that there is not humor here; but it is a purely human humor, as with the aged Buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw.  But this is just as humans are, not even Buddhist priests can be saints all the time.When irony is at last introduced into the film, it is the nastiest possible, emanating from the abbot of Red Lotus Temple, who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before.  He is incarnation of Miltons from Lost Better And if he cannot get to Satans hell soon enough, he will turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule.That is the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here It is not that the Abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to despair, to feel utterly hopeless, to accept his nihilism as allencompassing reality.  Thus there is a definite sense pervading the Red Temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the Temple itself  it has become all there is to the universe, and the Abbot, claiming mastery of infinite power, is in charge.Of course, fortunately, the film does not end there.  Though there are losses, the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails.  If you want to know how, see the film!  Yet there is no doubt that, in viewing this film, we visit hell.  Hopefully, we do not witness our own afterlives; but we certainly feel chastened by the experience  and somehow better for it over all.",
		"People expect no less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs a movie, and this movie is no exception.  Some movies I love did poorly at the box office but, I am glad to say, this movie is not one of them over nine million dollars, which I do not think was bad for back then.  The characters were fun, the animation was clear and not fuzzy, and the music was modern, too, which is unusual for an animated movie.  I thought professor at end for kids movie I thought professor at end for kids movie Overall, this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that I have loved dearly for years.",
		"A lot of people unfairly sh! t on this series but several of the Guinea Pig videos are fairly entertaining.  Devils Experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects worknot just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realisticespecially for the videos vintage and lowbudget.Let me start at the beginning now for those who do not know This film is an extreme torturefake snuff film that surfaced in Japan in the mid80s.  It is plot as it stands is simple A young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is.  This entails brutal violenceall effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girls arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound.The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground.  scenes are realism of rest of proceedings.The actress Her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling.  Some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest.  Also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels till she pukes.If you have not seen this series I hope I have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot. 8.510 for Devils Experiment.",

		"I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1.  Richard Dean Anderson 2.  Amanda Tapping.  These two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors.  The replacement of RDA in seasons 910 was enough to take the heart out of the show.The chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous.  You get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling.  This relationship carries over into the program we get to see.RDA gives his ONeill character believable personality.  He never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest.  others roll eyes in dismay at his utterances You watch eyes in dismay at his utterances Still, they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous.There is a lot going on between Carter and ONeill under the surface.  They manage to keep the lid on, but often just barely.  The episode Solitudes in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television.  The love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together.Carter and Jackson often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by ONeill.  Yet ONeills tactical instincts always seem sound.  He understands what to do without having to think about the matter.  The team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders.The quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10.  The original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest.  Ben Browder was far inferior to RDA in carrying the show.  He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all.  Amanda Tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons.  You could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby.  She was probably thinking more about the child than the show.The spinoff Stargate Atlantis has a few moments, but is mostly a weaker effort.  The major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original.  The villains Wraiths are so improbable as to be ludicrous.  Maybe Amanda Tapping can breathe some life into the program or it will not last beyond the fourth season.There has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show.  To have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in SciFi.  The use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad.  The campy use of decor from ancient Egypt concealing ultramodern technology is just as hard to accept.I wondered about some of the continuity on the show too.  In the season 2 opener, Daniel Jackson is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded.  He crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet.  The episode Hathor has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the SGC, yet it is never mentioned again.  This device could have been used in several later episodes on Daniel, ONeill, and Dr.  Frasier.",

She then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient, and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con.House of Games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout, and David Mamet does well in establishing his films setting in the underground levels of the city.  The film is well acted also, with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill.  Joe Mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film, and although his performance is a little under wrought, he is always solid and believable as the villain of the piece.  Lindsay Crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work, and again is believable in her role.  She may not be the greatest looker, but at least she can act.  The way that the film executes it is plot is the main star of the show, however, and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer.  At times it is almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film.

		"they do fun of thriller with your head they do fun of thriller with your head House Of Games does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do.  Of course, this is not a huge feat given the fact that we are dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate.  So it stands to reason that we never really know what is going on, even though we think that we do.  But that is what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game; a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities.It has a definite Hitchcock slant to it.  The film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort Marnie, considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the Masters more thoughtprovoking works.  One could easily consider the idea of Lindsay Crouses character being the same as Tippi Hedrins...ten year later perhaps.  Both are strongwilled loners, both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool.  As Crouses repressed, uptight character says, What is life without adventure?  Put your Reality Check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks!",
		"David Mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with House of Games, a character study fraught with psychological overtones, in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game.  Margaret Ford Lindsay Crouse has a successful practice and has written a bestselling novel, Driven.  Still, she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life; there is an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve, and it primes her vulnerability.  When a patient, Billy Hahn Steven Goldstein, confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers, and that they are going to kill him if he does not pay, she decides to intervene on his behalf.  she meets time before her into his world she meets time before her into his world Instead of the twentyfive large that Billy claimed he owed, Mike shows her his book, and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars.  And Mike agrees to wipe the slate clean, if she will agree to do him one simple favor, which involves a card game he has going on in the back room.  In the middle of a big hand, Mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes; while he is gone, her job is to watch for the tell of one of the other players.  By this time, not only Margaret, but the audience, as well, is hooked.  The dialogue, and Mamets unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines, is mesmerizing.  As Mike leads Margaret through his compelling, surreal realm of existence, and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game, we are swept right along with her.  From that first memorable encounter, when he demonstrates what a tell is and how it works, to the lessons of the short con, to the stunning climax of this film, Mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless.  And nothing is what it seems.  In the end, Margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature, and about herself.  She changes; and whether or not it is for the better is open to speculation.  Mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows, and does.  Crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here; you feel the rigid, uptight turmoil roiling beneath that calm, selfassured exterior, and when her experiences with Mike induce the change in her, she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated.  She makes you believe that she is capable of what she does, and makes you understand it, as well.  The dynamic supporting cast includes Mike Nussbaum Joey, Lilia Skala Dr.  Littauer, J.T.  Walsh The Businessman, Ricky Jay George and William H.  Macy Sergeant Moran.  House of Games is the quintessential Mamet; he is written and directed a number of highcaliber plays and films since, and will no doubt grace us with more in the future.  But this film will be the one that defines him; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up.  You will find it under Perfection.  This is one great movie you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 1010.",

		"I have to say, from the beginning, when i watched the Stargate movie movie i was not blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie, with a lot of POTENTIAL, though the movie was not as, erm, amazing as other sci fi movies such as Star wars or aliens, which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing, even though i am not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people, i do not remember one line from either of those movies, i am not a big fan of wearing star wars T shirts, in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you, ah getting slightly off the point here, well my point is that the that you do not have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series, which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end, in 2006.though i did not like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997, and let me tell you, the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series, the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects, were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today.  he did shows like SG1 in my opinion he did shows like SG1 in my opinion he did shows like SG1 in my opinion",
		"Bruce Almighty is the best Jim Carrey work since The Truman Show, and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent Hey Hollywood  look how good I can act!  box office disappointments.  It is great to see Jim recognizing and embracing his strengths.  He will not get an Academy Award but the film itself will last longer than many of the awarded films of the Academy.  He is form in it without hey mom A real surprise was Steven Carrell as Carreys nemesis Carrell of The Daily Show fame, who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film.  I laughed harder at Carell than anyone else in the past three years.I can foresee the religious nuts in the US will be upinarms over the treatment of God, but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs  we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will.  Without Married With Children t o complain about, this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities who know the types  men adorned in gold watches on Sunday morning and late nigh television, selling prayers to God.  And, again, about 0.5 of the country will care and 80 of the media will report it.The bottom line this a purely entertaining film, each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do, and a feelgood feeling at the movie conclusion.  A walk down any major street in America has to confirm that God has a tremendous sense of humor.  What better comic genius to remind us of that than Jim Carry.Thanks again, Jim  it is GREAT to have you back!!",
		"Bruce Almighty looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers.  Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more.  Bruce Jim Carrey is angry at God and is given divine powers by him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job.  Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God, and though it is not his usual type of film or one of his best roles, he does excellent with what he is given to work with.  film does soup in half like Red Sea It is overly exaggerated at times, and there is some crude humor, but overall it manages to be somewhat funny.  There is a decent supporting cast, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell, which always helps.  The end of the film proves to be very romantic and tearjerking, and the message is clear, that we should do what God has called us to do and be the miracle.  The film is far from perfect, but still enjoyable, and far better than I and many people probably would have expected, especially if we see the deeper message of the film. out of ",
		"Now either you like Mr Carreys humour or you do not.  Me, Myself and Irene had audiences both walking out in droves and, on the other hand, cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth.  Bruce Almighty is a bit more mainstream, but you have been warned.If you are not sure, watch the trailer.  I saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when I saw the film.  If you do not find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny, do not bother with the movie.Carrey, a reporter stuck in a rut covering lighter news berates God when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot.  God takes up the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better.  Carrey gets powers by everyones by computer commands.This Carrey gets powers by everyones by computer commands.This His most accomplished straight role, the Man on the Moon, is less well known that his comedy romps  or The Truman Show on which the Academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing Carrey.",
		"Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck.  Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums and of course they have to be Mexican, obviously, his good will towards his fellow man backfires.  In that case, it was not too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but I like that the movie suggests that things like that should not be ignored.  I am reminded of the episode of Michael Moores brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay.  The results were not very promising, so it is nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example.Jim Carrey plays the part of Bruce Nolan, the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart.  Or even better, it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere a little metaphor that comes up when Bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film.  Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that is seeking to bake the worlds biggest cookie.  He is desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station, but he loses his cool on live TV when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague.  You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report.  he loses TV in scenes of film.Morgan Freeman He is the kind of God who takes his job very seriously, but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life.  I love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day.  There are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in America who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans.One of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives, and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewers religion.  I, for example, tend to reject organized religion in all forms and I see God and Satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live.  But despite the fact that I do not believe that God exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time, I was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie.Jim Carreys movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he is come.  If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura both of which I loved, by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film, it is amazing how far he is come.  He has moved from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, and The Majestic easily one of his greatest films ever.  Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today.Jennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the sidesplitting Office Space as Bruces girlfriend, who becomes increasingly exasperated by Bruces growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him.  There is definitely some lowbrow comedy in the film that does not really fit with the importance of the films meaning or the quality of the delivery, such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene, but it was definitely pretty nice to see Ace Venturas friend Spike make a cameo appearance.  As Stephen King very well knows, it is always nice to see familiar characters.  It is almost like seeing family again.Bruce is endowed with the powers of God for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better, and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him.  The thing I love about this is that, like I said before, religion is absent from my life, but I was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things I would have done had I been endowed with such powers.  The movie allows us to learn vicariously this way, which empowers the message even more.The scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film, such as the scene when Bruce loses his temper about the anchor position, the Jimmy Hoffa scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records, the scene where Bruces rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera, and my favorites, the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakerys cooking.  The movie has plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent jokes, such as when he says to God who reveals that he is the janitor, the proprietor, the electrician, etc that his Christmas parties must be real bashes, and to be careful about drinking, because on of him might need a ride home!  I also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes.  A little too true, and as Gallagher would add, behind every great man is also an amazed motherinlaw.Bruce Almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while, and is probably the only directly religious that I can remember seeing that I am anxious to buy on DVD to add to my personal collection.  It is a comedy written and performed in good taste, but with enough relatively lowbrow humor to keep the kids entertained.  This is a meaningful comedy for the whole family, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days.  In a world that is about to be flogged with yet another American Pie film AND another Scary Movie which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy, it is nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching.  Do not miss this one.",
		"Soul are episodes in version of Twilight Zone As I mentioned in my comment on the new series, there is something lacking in this new series.  Maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned.  It is a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than Serlings version.  However, this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too.  I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, the lovers can never unite.  I remember I was not surprised by the Korean movie Il Mare later remade into The Lake House.  I think it is because I saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film.",
		"This a good episode of The New Twilight Zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories I note both of them are based on short stories.  Examination Day is set in the future, year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves, huge TVlooking phones that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age...and the Examination Day, a point where 12yearolds must undergo a governmentrequired IQ test.  The kid is this story, Dickie Jordan David Mendenhall is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid, so is calm, even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades.  His parents Christopher Allport and Elizabeth Norment, on the other hand, say he should not have used his birthday wish on getting a good score, and while their reason includes that they believe he is capable and he should have no need to worry, it is pretty obvious they are worried.  I will not give anything away in the ending, but I will say this  there is a point where we get a glimpse of what is to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject that evening or another?  his parents ask Dickie whether he would prefer to watch TV all night.  By todays standards, we would be pleased he would say he would rather read and not just because there is nothing worth watching...but why would his family ask this?  The flavor of what is encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from Harrison Bergenon which I hear has not received a great adaptation to the screen.  I only wish they could have provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as The Obsolete Man was.  I found it to be better than the short story it was based on.  McNeill is fever from water in Massachusetts hometown it was fever from water in Massachusetts hometown it was fever from water in Massachusetts hometown I have fever from water in Massachusetts hometown I have fever from water in Massachusetts hometown They both recover, especially since it is common for that to happen in 1985, but the connection does not go away.  Charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each others company, especially Peter, who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students, even at the college he is been staying in one place at.  Things take an unexpected turn, though, when Charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from England as a sign of bewitchment, added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever not so common in 1700.  The two try to learn a way to save her.  The ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching.  Both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times, through a lessonwarning that sounds like something Rod Sterling would have cooked up and entertainment, make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship, love, and wisdom do a great deal.  Probably 34 of this has no theme, but somehow I think it all would have been approved by Sterlings crew.",
		"You know how Star Trek fans flocked to all the Star Trek movies, even the really bad ones?  Why?  To see their heroes in action one more time.  That is the way I feel about Doc Savage.  I am a major fanatic for the character, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming.  And the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation.  they decided elements from number of Doc adventures There is a lot of promise in here, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices the music, the camp elements, etc.  But the spirit of Doc is there, and that is what those of us familiar with Doc and his crew respond to.  So, in my longwinded way, what I am trying to say is that this is not a bad movie it is just not as good as it should have been.  And anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai, and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all.",
		"It has said that The Movies and Baseball both thrived during The Great Depression.  It appears that the grim realities of a Nation caught up in the aftermath of this Economic Disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace.  A temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is Baseball.Likewise, an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the Cinema.  The presence of a Radio in just about everyones house hold kept Depression Era America at once attuned to Worlds Events and provided many a Drama and especially Comedy Shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality.The literature of the time also flourished at all levels.  The juvenile reading habits helped to create the Comic Book as we know it, what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures.  But the Comic Book just did not magically appear, all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages, all by itself.  There were mediums that were ancestral to them.  Obviously,the Newspaper Comic Strip was one parent, providing the visualnarrative method of story telling.The other direct ancestor was the Pulp Magazine.  The inexpensive, prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going, though not necessarily serialized, tales.  The pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to Edgar Rice Borroughs TARZAN and Johnston McCulleys ZORRO.  The 1930s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like THE SHADOW, THE AVENGER, G8s BATTLE ACES and THE SPIDER,MASTER of MEN all found their way to the news stands, among many others.One other was DOC SAVAGE, a fullblooded super hero of the written story; the covers of the pulps had perhaps, the only picture of the hero.  Possessing extraordinary strength, super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect, Doc was the prototype Super Hero.He also assembled 5 of his former Army Buddies into a small, free lancing team of adventurers.  Each of them was an expert in a given field.  So we had a top rated Chemist, Lawyer, Construction Engineer, Electrical Engineer, GeologistArchaeologistPaleontologist, etc.The Doc Savage stories were very popular in the 1930s and 40s, and were published into the middle 50s.  Then they went into a hiatus for a good 1215 years.  Then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new container, the paperback book.  art was series of paintings with shirt.The reintroduction Soon, there was a rumor of a Doc Savage movie!  But when, by what Producer?  Well, the venerable Man of Bronze was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together.  It was veteran Stopaction Animator and Producer of top Special Effects films, Geoprge Pal, who did the film along with Warner Brothers.When DOC SAVAGE, MAN OF BRONZE arrived in the Movie Houses, it boasted of a well casted team of actors, albeit a largely No Name as far familiarity with the viewers.  With former Tarzan of TV,Ron Elys nearly perfect casting in the lead, up and coming Beauty of a Starlette, Pamela Hensley in the female lead and veteran character Paul Wexler as the villainous, Captain Seas; no other name would have been recognized.  And, just maybe that was a plus in this case.The story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going.  Use of narration, by Paul Frees, and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story.From the very start, there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured Camp humor as the Batman TV series.  Some really great looking early scenes involving Doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the Paul Frees narration and the unexpected, unlikely outcomes.  For Example, an experiment of Docs with a miniature rocketmissile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish, a small one at that.  The whole story unfolds like that, hitting the viewer with a little Camp every so often, as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously.  We are also puzzled about Mr.  George Pals being the Producerhis last.  He who had been so well known for Special Effects, surely a factor that could be put to good use in a scifi action setting of the Pulp Characters world.I can remember seeing it quite vividly.  Mrs.  Ryan Deanna was in the Hospital, just having given birth to our 2nd child, Michelle081475.  Our older girl, Jennifer, was visiting her Grandmother, so after visiting hours were over in the Maternity Ward, it was straight over to the old Marquette Theatre, 63rd  Kedzie, here in Chicago.Having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with Doc, I was sort of let down by the final product.  I could accept a little of this Camp business, but would not have objected if Mr.Pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat Dinosaurs and Volcanoes to give it all a little more PulpComicSerial type excitement.And yet, the cast, headedup by Mr.  Ely and the others, made the whole film likable, if not lovable.  The sets and locations were, as far as we can see, very much like those of a 30s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone.And maybe that is just what they were trying for with this DOC SAVAGE, MAN of BRONZE.",
		"series is year after Abydos in movie Stargate It explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention.  Such as, how was the Stargate activated without a human computer?  Where did the Goauld Ras race come from?  How many are there?  The first episode has a retired Jack ONeill spelled with 2 Ls recalled to active duty by General George Hammond due to an attack by the shut down Stargate from Apophis, a powerful Goauld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman.  We meet Samantha Carter, a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the Stargate the first time, and is determined to go through now.  We find out that Daniel got married on Abydos, and that there are hundreds of Gate addresses that they can dial.  Then Daniels wife gets captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen.  It continues in the second episode where General Hammond announces the formation of the SGC which includes nine teams, in which Jacks team will be SG1 which consists of Jack, Samantha and Daniel.  They go to Chulak, a Goauld homeworld to rescue Daniels wife and another one captured at Abydos named Skara.  They get captured, and just as Apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners, a Jaffa named Tealc, First Prime of Apophis, saves them and goes to Earth with them, where he is made part of SG1.  That was only the beginning of the adventure.  In the course of the show they have gone to the past and future, gotten transported to alternate realities, swapped bodies, grown old, met alien races which include a rebel alliance of Goauld called the Tokra, in which Samanthas Dad becomes a member, the Asgard, a cute little race in which we see Thor most often he is Jacks buddy,and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times.The show was recently canceled, but lasted ten seasons.  In season nine, a new enemy called the Ori came in flaunting brand new powers, new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the Stargate and its creators, the Ancients.  Season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters, Ben Browder as Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG1 and Claudia Black as Vala MalDoran, a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team.  Very wellproduced, interesting characters, fantastic Special effects and a subtle love interest between Samantha and Jack, this one has it all.  A different way of travelling the galaxy, and different kinds of adventures, this is one show you do not want to miss.  Unlock the gate and step through.  You will not regret it!",
		"Possible spoilersI recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences.  Ron Ely is just right as Doc.  Cool, calm, almost always in controland with an occasional twinkle in his eye.  What more can one ask for?  I have never read a Doc Savage book, so I do not know if it is faithful to the source but I enjoyed the light tone and derringdo.  Many people have compared this movie to Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I do not think is fair.  The difference in budget is astoundingRaiders must have at least 10 times the budget.  Doc Savage does not have the extensive location work that Raiders has.  Special effects are also at a minimum but come on people, the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right.  The Sousa music is catchylove that theme song Every time I watch the film, I end up humming the theme for days.The best way to approach this film is to just RELAX and enjoy.  Doc chase sniper throughout fight between Captain Seas Highlights include sniper throughout fight between Captain Seas Not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib really!.  Overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day.  I give it 7 out of 10.Doc Savage, Doc Savage...thank the lord he is here!",
		"The problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the 60screated concept that comic books could only be done as camp i.e., the 60s Batman show for TV and movie.  Thus you have combat sequences with subtitles come on! guy encased gold like Herve for Oscar statute guy encased gold like Herve for Oscar statute And when they are not doing booming Sousa march scores, the tinkly little funny music undercuts much of the drama.Even as such, this movie is...okay.  It is fun, and when it stays serious it is a very accurate representation of the pulps.  Except for Monk, as has been mentioned before he is hugely muscled, not obese.  And Long Tom, who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude, not Paul Gleason with an inexplicable scarf.The Green Death sequences, for instance, are remarkably gruesome and not something I would recommend for children.  But they are very close to the feel of the pulps.  When the writers and producers get it right, they do get it right  I will give them that.But if the producers had done Doc with the loving care and scripting of, say, Reeves first two Superman movies, think what we might have had then.  I think the problem is the movies schizophrenic.  There is a definite sense of trying to do a 30s homage, but they are also trying to give in to the heroes must be camp attitude that Batman created.  One gets the impression there was a sober, pulpstyle first draft and then someone came in and said, Hey, let us make it funny  it worked with the Batman show 8 years ago! But Doc lives on, thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai.  If MacRauch as not doing a homage to Doc Savage in that movie, the man is truly demented.  So when the series actually gets on TV allegedly midseason in 9900, Doc Savage, updated to the 90s, will live once more.",

		"The makers have chosen the best people for the job, and set the scene wonderfully.  Every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it.  Whether the period is the 20s the first story, the present ie 1950 for the middle story, or the 1910s the last, costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created.  I love ladies in sanatorium by Shetland shawls Roland Culver as Ashenden is very appealing, but never mind the soppy young lovers, it is Raymond Huntley as the man who resents his wifes health and independence who harrows our emotions.  He usually played comical, pompous types, but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive.  The China Seas great 30s film starring Gable and Harlow stole the plot from the Mr Know All episode and also nicked a story by Kipling.  I wish we saw more of Naunton Wayne as the jealous husband  though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a Mexican hat.  I love that posh bird who plays his wife, too.",
		"Made after QUARTET was, TRIO continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by Maugham.  Here the three stories are THE VERGER, MR.  KNOWITALL, and SANITORIUM.  The first two are comic THE VERGER is like a prolonged joke, but one with a good payoff, and the last more serious as health issues are involved.  Again the author introduces the film and the stories.James Hayter, soon to have his signature role as Samuel Pickwick, is the hero in THE VERGER.  He holds this small custodialtype job in a church, but the new Vicar Michael Hordern is an intellectual snob.  When he hears Hayter has no schooling he fires him.  Hayter has saved some money, so he tells his wife Kathleen Harrison he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop.  He has a good eye, and his store thrives.  Soon he has a whole chain of stores.  When his grandchild is christened by Hordern, the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his exVerger.  The payoff is when bank manager Felix Aylmer meets with Hayter about diversifying his investments.  I will leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting.According to Maugham he met a man like Max Kelada Nigel Patrick on a cruise.  In MR.  KNOWITALL Kelada is a splashy, friendly, and slightly overbearing type from the Middle East who is on a business trip regarding jewelry by steamship.  His stateroom mate is Mr.  Grey the ever quiet and proper Wilfred HydeWhite who is somewhat, silently disapproving of Max.  Max likes to enliven things, and soon is heavily involved in the ships entertainment.  At this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the nonMaugham story and film CHINA SEAS 1935, as Max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real.  I will not describe the way Max rises to the occasion.SANITORIUM is the longest segment.  Roland Culver plays Ashenden the fictional alterego of Maugham  a writer and one time spy as in Hitchcocks THE SECRET AGENT.  he has couple of months for his health He finds a remarkable crew of people, including Jean Simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman, Finlay Currie as an irascible Scotsman, John Laurie as a second irascible Scotsman who is at war with Currie, Raymond Huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up, and Michael Rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness.  Culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions.  The last, dealing with Simmons and Rennie, is ironic but deeply moving.It was a dandy followup to the earlier QUARTET, and well worth watching.",

		"I saw trailer for Afro of movie trailers It looked like what it is; a highly tendentious wacky comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay.  It would seem that Redd Foxxs RF wife has left him for his brother, who works with him at the store back in Phoenix.  He has taken the bus to visit his son Norman is Los Angeles.So as RF arrives, Norman, wearing nothing but powderblue bikini shorts, gets out of his waterbed to answer the door.  Trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake his lover, who steadfastly refuses to budge.  It was just to the point where I wrote WHY will not he wake up?  when suddenly he does, and me and my friends jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blueeyed, swirlhairdoed Garson, Normans white livein lover, who just had the most faaaaaabulous dream Garson is a flaming queen of a type that can ONLY be imagined as emerging from 1976 L.A.  He has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry, and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on Carol Brady from The Brady Bunch.Norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his fathers visit.  Garson goes to stay with Waylon Flowers, and Madam answers the phone when Norman calls.  So RF attempts to reach his wife in Mexico.  While he is on the phone, Garson comes in to pack his dress and RF confronts him.  With a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation but sounding more like we are about to hear a very special track by The Emotions, he realizes that his son is gay.His first impulse is I will kill him.  I will kill him.  Then RF goes on a long walk, wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have, such as maybe we toilet trained him too soon.  His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk, for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man.  Surprisingly, he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality.  This, it must be said, is about eight more books on homosexuality than MY parents bought.  He then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all!  RF then hires Audrey, a sixfoot Amazon prostitute in this amazing fur thing played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones.  He hired her for Norman to try out heterosexuality, but this pisses Norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend Melody.Then Garson comes over and offers to take RF out for the night.  He commiserates over the loss of RFs wife, and tells the tale of his own mother, who harbors an irrational prejudice against Pilippinos because she was molested at a luau.  They attend a long featured performance of Wayon and Madam, which culminates in Madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose.  Once more, mouths were agape.So it seems that, would not ya just know it, RF and Garson have a wonderful evening together!  You see, staid, traditional older black men just have to see the crappy, highlyeffeminate entertainment of megaqueens in order to come around to ALL the gay world has to offer!  It is really JUST that simple!  This still does not prevent RF from yelling Rape!  when Garson wakes him from a bad dream.  It ends less predictably than you would think.There was so much that was just off.  WHAT is the basis of Norman and Garson s relationship?  They do not seem to have ANY rapport, and Norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking Garson out, and even when he comes around to stand up for himself, he never defends Garson or talks about their relationship.  There were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like RF going to buy all those books on homosexualityand sitting right down on the park bench to read them!  I like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality, rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends.Other than that, it is kind of just what it seems like a little relic of a bygone era, an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance, we could all learn to love and understand one another!  And because of the whole naivet? of this thing, the extreme stereotypes and messageladen dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated, and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years.  I guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays female friends are desperately in love with them, and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with, and by extension convert, them.

		"When the Chamberlain family is camping near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain Meryl Streep sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience.  For it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press, and the whole thing turns into a circus.  Lindy does not help matters either because she will not play to the jury or courtroom, she is only herself, and she is a tough nut to crack, so of course everyone thinks she is guilty because there is a piece of evidence that has not come to light.  Neill is doubts about his about his wife It is good or bad to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the States too, because the Australian public does not believe the story and the media only fans the flames.  Eventually, Lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor, but years later, a missing piece of evidence shows up and she is freed, but not until after the familys life is basically ruined.  A heartbreaking story, very well done, a bit long but well worth seeing. 8 out of 10.",
		"A CRY IN THE DARK A CRY IN THE DARK was a film that I anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid, if unremarkable film.  This assumption came from the fact that aside from Streeps Best Actress nomination, the movie received little attention from major awards groups.Little did I anticipate that A CRY IN THE DARK would be such a riveting drama, wellconstructed on every level.  If you ask me, this is an underappreciatted classic.The film opens rather slowly, letting the audience settle into the Chamberlains at a relaxed pace and really notice that, at the core, they are an incredibly loving, simple family.  director selects sense of Lindy for their children.While has become somewhat of a punchline these days, the movie never even comes close to laughable.  The actual death of Azaria is horrifyingly captured.  It is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience horrified and asking questions.The majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the Chamberlains continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court, which suspects Lindy of murder.The fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping.  As an audience member, I was fully invested in the Chamberlains plight... and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media.  But at the same, the mediapublic opinion is understandable.  I loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic, but they always had valid reasons to hold their views.The final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas.In terms of performances, the only ones that really matter in this film are those of Streep and Neill... and they deliver in every way.  For me, this ranks as one of if not 1 Meryl Streeps best performances.  For all her mastery of different accents which of course are very impressive in their own right, Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters.  I find this to be one of Streeps more subtle performances, and she hits it out of the park.  And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streeps performance.  From what I have seen, this is undoubtedly Neills finest work to date.  It is a shame he was not recognized by the Academy with a Leading Actor nomination to match Streeps... bc the two of them play of each other brilliantly.More emotionally gripping than most films, and also incredibly suspenseful...  A CRY IN THE DARK far exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where Meryl screams The dingo took my baby!  watch the film and see just how much more there is to A CRY IN THE DARK then that one line....

		"Fascinating movie, based on a true story, about an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain Meryl Streep accused of killing her baby daughter.  She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is highly suspicious.  The film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case, the way Australians interpreted what was presented in the media, and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the womans conviction, based on barely any hard evidence.  I love look on people by justice system I have always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 Angry Men before they go through with their duties.  It is not, as has often been said, a liberal movie, but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge.  A Cry in the Dark is likewise clinical.  Schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic.  Some may find the film boring or dry, but I found it engaging.",
		"In August 1980 the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents Lindy and Michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation.  The media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood.  What followed was a gross miscarriage of justice.Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that while camping near Ayers Rock, central Australia, that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area.  Noone believed them.  Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and Michael as an accessory after the fact.  The whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing.  The Chamberlains trial was over before it began.Lindy never proved her innocence, so she was found guilty.  There was never enough evidence to convict her, yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure.  How could we as a nation even sit in judgement?  From where we are, how could we possibly presume to know?  Unless there was absolute proof, and no reasonable doubt whatsoever, the Chamberlains should have been acquitted.Fred Schepisis film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of John Brysons novel, that the Chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them.  dingo did Azaria on night at Ayers Rock.Schepisi dingo did Azaria on night at Ayers Rock.Schepisi He shows Australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the Chamberlains pay!  His screenplay, cowritten with Robert Caswell, vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred.The outstanding Meryl Streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts.  She brings to life most convincingly the tough little Aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight.  Even her accent is almost, but not quite, spot on.  A very good effort by the master of that trade.  Sam Neill is every bit as good as Streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned Michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart, and he starts to question his Christianity.  His, as was Streeps, is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly.  The entire support cast are also excellent, with some of Australias finest actors and actresses playing a part.Technically the film is brilliant too, with Director of Photography Ian Baker capturing this great land with splendour especially the Rock.  Editor Jill Bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged, while Bruce Smeaton provides a telling score.For all Aussies this is a must see, a shocking look in the mirror if you will, at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served, and the truth to be known.  As Michael Chamberlain said  I do not think anybody really understands what innocence means.....to innocent people.Saturday, May 20, 1995  VideoEven on return viewings Fred Schepisis account of the travesty of justice that befell the Chamberlains, who lost baby Azaria at Ayres rock in 1980, is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving.Schepisi and Robert Caswell have expertly transferred John Brysons novel to the screen, telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, whose new born daughter Azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down.Amid media speculation and vicious public rumour Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and Michael was charged as an accessory after the fact.  What followed was little more than trial by media, and with the Australian people determined she be put away, Lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence.Meryl Streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles Australia head on to prove her innocence.  She is truly awesome, and the only thing that fails her is a true blue Aussie accent, though she does her level best to sound ocker.  You might wonder why a top Australian actress was not cast in the role, but star power is probably the answer.  Alongside Meryl is an equally impressive Sam Neill, outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes, while he feels powerless to do anything about it.  A strong Aussie cast lend compelling support.Editing from Jill Bilcock is very timely, Ian Bakers cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and Bruce Smeatons music is perfect for the part.  Truly a must for all conscientious Australians.Sunday, June 15, 1996  Video",

The central characters, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, whose daughter disappears during a night out in the Australian outback, are not bad people, but then surely not all, or even most, of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better.  film wants Chamberlains from start of their lifes we are Chamberlains from start of their lifes we are Chamberlains from start of their lifes It is not a movie about the degenerate society of Australia in particular; it is merely an account of a true story that happened there.  Society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are.When a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigines dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog, when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines, newspapers and TV programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy, there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of ones own unaware perceptions, influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround ones life.  The reason I appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out, from the victims to the masses.The evidence against Lindy Chamberlain aside, suspicion was jetfueled mostly by a virtue of hers.  To the public eye, she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter.  Why was she able to keep her cool, even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up, for TV and the press?  How much of the downward spiral could have been prevented had she behaved more to the publics liking in the media?  Meryl Streep, one of, if not the, greatest actress working today, may not give a performance that particularly stands out, and frankly neither does any other actor, or department of filmmaking.  But she, and the screenwriters, do understand Lindy.  What is infuriating is that it is not that difficult.  Apparently, she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case.  Whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense, we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation.Whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as Sophies Choice, The Devil Wears Prada, Angels In America or other such work, it is a triumph.  It is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself.  She frustrates us because we do not know what she is thinking or feeling.

		"Streep is performance as her as her defense Based on the book Evil Angels and titled so in its Australian release, A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch.  It presents a scenario that is all too real for us in America the witchhunt against a person deemed an easy target.Lindy Chamberlain was this woman.  Being someone who spoke her mind, someone who did not play the sympathy card, and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal, she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she did not kill her own child.  The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece.  And through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as ever, even when her husband Michael was falling apart.This stance, of course, is the power of strength, as unsympathetic as it may look like, and people happen to react strongly to that.  They want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn, not sit there and look blank.  People do not understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations.  Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold, but not unfeeling woman, one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty.  Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair  someone has to, or the Chamberlains would be too detached, and no one wants to see that.

As Seventh Day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day and soon have Azaria dedicated to God at their church, with their two older boys looking on.  Michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to Ayers Rock, one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of Australia.  Not being wealthy, the family camps near the site.  After a wonderful first day, Lindy puts baby Azaria to sleep in one of the tents.  Suddenly, she hears Azaria crying.  As Lindy rushes to the tent, a dingo dog is just exiting, shaking his head.  The baby is gone and soon, so is the dingo.  Although the entire camp looks for the baby, she is not found.  Concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child, the Chamberlains struggle to accept Gods decision and go on with their lives.  But, unfortunately, the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that Lindy murdered the baby.  She is subsequently arrested and put on trial.  How could this happen?  This is a great depiction of real events that shows how mob rule is not a figment of the imagination.  The entire country turns against the Chamberlains, in part because they are seen as odd.  Streep gives her best performance ever as the complex Lindy, whose own strongwilled demeanor works against her every step of the way.  Neill, likewise, does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused Michael.  cast is depictions of folks around Lindys case The costumes, scenery, script, direction and production are all top of the line.  If you have never seen or heard of this film, remedy that straight away.  It is not a far cry from reality to say that this Cry should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media.",

Streep received lot of recognition for her performance I say lot of recognition for her performance I say lot of recognition for her performance Let us just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for Streep because she had to learn an Australian accent.  She learned it so well I had trouble understanding her in parts.Without giving anything away, all I can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally.",

Some of the best filmmakers in the are Australian.  The cinematography in ROLL was especially impressive.  I loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes.3.

Needless to say, Mat becomes enmeshed in the chaos, and it is not long before thoughts of tomorrows match are shunted to the back of his mind as the nights frantic events unravel.Accomplished Western Australian professional Shakespearean actor Toby Malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive countryboy Mat, and successfully plays a part well below his age.  Best support comes from John Batchelor as Tiny, and an entertaining role by David Ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events.

		"A wrongdoer is often a man that has left something undone, not always he that has done something.Emperor Marcus Aurelius The DVD release of Watch on the Rhine could not come at a better moment.  It restores to us a major Lillian Hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by Dashiell Hammett Hellman scholar Bernard F.  Dicks audio commentary affirms his authorship.  It presents performance by Bette at Bros. lot Equally significantly, it reminds us that World War II had a purpose.Sure, you say, like we needed that.  We have heard Cary Grant sermonizing in Destination Tokyo 1943 about Japanese boys and their Bushido knives.  We have watched jackboots stomp the living hills in The Sound of Music 1965.  We have toured an England callously occupied by Germany in It Happened Here 1966.  Yet, truth to tell, we still need the message spread.I have an 81yearold friend who curses Franklin Roosevelt regularly.  He feels that FDR connived the U.S. into a foreign fight we did not need, and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin.  He is encouraged in his demonizing of Allied leaders and the trivializing of War Two by Patrick Buchanan.The political columnist has freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claims that Adolf Hitler would have posed no further menace to Poland, Europe, or the world if only the Third Reich had been handed the Free City of Danzig in 1939.  Buchanan holds that if those selfish Poles had not confronted the Nazis, drawing in foolishly meddling Britain and giddily altruistic France, no war would have engulfed the West.  He believes that without the rigors of Total War, no one in Germany would have built gas chambers to provide a Final Solution to the Jewish Problem.Some commenters on this site feel that Watch sags under the weight of stale propaganda.  Maybe.  However, neither my friend nor Pat Buchanan seem to have gotten the films point Some people hurt and kill to grab other peoples land, goods, and liberty; such people dominated the Axis Powers and enough did not appear in their vocabulary.Paul Lukas deserved the Oscar he won.  He and Bette Davis put convincing passion into their portrayals of refugees who fight oppressors.  They give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sidelines, for actively facing down torturers and murderers.  Bernard Dick notes that Hellman did not care for Lukas as a person since he stayed apolitical.  Of course, as a Hungarian he had seen firsthand Bela Kuns bloody dictatorship of the proletariat replace an outmoded empire and then topple to Admiral Horthys rightwing tyranny.In a marvelous cameo role added to the play by Hammett, Henry Daniell sardonically depicts a Wehrmacht officer of the class that disdains the brown shirts he serves.  His Phili von Ramme would doubtless stand with Field Marshal Rommel in 1944 during the Plot of July 20th against Hitler.  In April 1940, however, he pragmatically abets the Nazi cause, although he insults Herr Blecher the Butcher and scorns the Rumanian aristocrat Teck de Brancovis for trying to peddle information on an Underground leader.Teck, a pauper and possible cuckold, wishes cash and a visa to return to Europe where he can resume the shreds of a life that had come undone with the empireshattering Great War and the greater worldwide economic Depression.  He has no political convictions, no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow.  Mercury Theater graduate George Coulouris lends this burntout cases Old World cynicism an edge of desperate menace.Lucille Watson gives winsome vitality to the grasping mans hostess, a domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her waybut who does not adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls.  She and her pallid officebound son belong to the American version of von Rammes and de Brancovis privileged kind.  However, this family has not seen ruin and never will.  They are moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it.This mother and son might easily make choices which would reflect that complaisance toward National Socialism and Fascism which flourishes today in my friend and in pundit Buchanan.  Watch on the Rhine has a manicured period look.  Its dialogue reflects its erudite origins on the stage rather than sounding fresh from the streets.  Yet Hellman and Hammetts film has gutbased power.  Audiences still need to hear and heed its call to arms against grabbers relentlessly on the march.",
		"I saw movie in my of New York I went on to live there for the next 26 years,but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small TV movie.  It was part of a PBS series as I recall, and I have never forgotten it.  There are no sex scenes to speak of, just delicate, moving, extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement, all set within a conservative, Boston I think, World War 1 environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war, and did not seek out a career and financial independence.  Frances Lee McCain is superb in the role of career photographer and I have spent the next 30 odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail.There has to be a video of this movie?  Sure it should be on DVD but surely at least a video?",
		"I am fan of Dukes of TV show And I really enjoyed this flick.  I enjoyed myself here a lot more than I did with other summer blockbusters.It is funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like lame plot and it is much cruder than the show.  Does ANYONE remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode?  Daisy makes incest jokes and Bo says that Luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage.  The only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot.And as far as the plot goes.  It was the perfect Dukes plot.  In fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any TV show that has migrated to the big screen.While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not EXACTLY like their small screen versions, they do a great job and work very well together.  I was not too keen on Burts Boss Hogg though.  And I would have like a little bit more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe.  In the movie Roscoe is a little... scary.And who did not have a smile on their face as the General Lee is racing through the streets of Atlanta and the back roads of Hazzard? Folks, allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you will not be sorry.  It is just a great dumb movie!",
		"The making of The Thief Of Bagdad is quite a story unto itself, almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film.  Alexander Korda nearly went broke making this film.According to the Citadel Film series Book about The Great British Films, adopted son of the United Kingdom Alexander Korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation.  But World War II unfortunately caught up with Korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle.Budget costs happen in US films too, only Cecil B.  DeMille always had a free hand at Paramount after 1932 when he returned there.  But DeMille nor any of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film.  Korda transported Ingram as genie in Grand Canyon He certainly was not going to get scenery like that in the UK.  Korda also finished the interiors in Hollywood, all in time for a release on Christmas Day 1940.The spectacle of the thing earned The Thief Of Bagdad four Academy Award nominations and three Oscars for best color cinematography, best artset direction for a color film, and best special effects.  Only Miklos Roszas original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category.  Korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the Grand Canyon because it is impossible to get bad color pictures from that place.The special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil.  The good is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez and the evil is Conrad Veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart, both belonging to Duprez.  This was Veidts career role until Casablanca where he played the Luftwaffe major Stroesser.  Of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source.  Beggar boy and thief Sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star.  Literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the Maharajah of Mysore he was spotted by Alexander Korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features.  Sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the Arabian Nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant.  Not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that.The Thief Of Bagdad holds up remarkably well today.  It is an eternal tale of love, romance, and adventure in any order you want to put it.",
		"I have today on TCM of Geraldine Fitzgerald She is a much underrated actress and I have to admit I have had a crush on her since I first saw her probably in Wuthering Heights 40 or more years ago.  The real star in this movie, however, is Paul Lukas, and he deserved all the accolades he got.  He makes it clear, whether we like it or not, that the end justifies the means.  Naziism had to be stopped, and anything that helped do it was good.  He gave his children a line about being bad, and that they should not be bad, but as he said earlier when conversing with adults, he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation.  Lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation, and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do.Some people think his victim was a Nazi, but I do not think so  I think he was only after the money.  His Nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him.One interesting point in the film, and presumably also in the play, is the fact that Muller Lucas is a German.  While the anti German hysteria of WWI was not repeated in WWII, there was considerable antiGerman sentiment and some Germans were interred similar to what happened in California with people of Japanese ancestry.  It was something of an act of bravery for Hellman to write a play about good Germans at this time maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the NaziSoviet pact!.  After all, the US and British air forces were bombing German cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians.  I think, however, that the Dresden bombing and firestorm happened later, after Watch on the Rhine was released.The title is something of a play on words, as the watch is looking west, from Germany.  In fact, Watch am Rhein was a German army marching song  used in WWII, but the Nazis had their own marching song that was used as well.  But Muller IS a German and he is engaged in his own Wach am Rhein.All the other actors did an excellent job here; although Bodo was too much there are children like him.  I am surprised he did not give his fathers secret away.  In real life, he may very well have done so.",
		"Words can hardly describe it, so I will be brief.  The Thief of Bagdad was my favorite movie as a child, and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me.  I loved this film from the first moment I saw it, when I was a boy of six who had started reading The Arabian Nights.  I remember room in middle of Sabus battle Sabu and John Justin are superb as the dashing heros, Conrad Veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain Jaffar, and Rex Ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie.  Georges Perinals photography is some of the best use of Technicolor.  One of the three credited directors is Michael Powell, a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films, including A Matter of Life and Death aka Stairway to Heaven and The Red Shoes.  He is one of the true masters of the camera, right up there with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa, and Orson Welles.As with all great works of art, the beauty of The Thief of Bagdad lies in the detail.  Every frame has its own magical charm.  The story never lags, and the characters and their actions are always involving.  Here is a film that will never grow old.",
		"The movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful, but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of Baghdad. the jailed prince meets a thief called Abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called Basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with, but unbeknown to him the evil wizard Jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her.  Jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns Abu into a dog.  This leads to the prince and Abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat Jafa, restore peace to Baghdad and marry the princess. during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic Genies that takes Abu on a flight through the clouds, a giant spider that is really hungry, and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen.This is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses, genies, flying carpets, and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs.  It does not have any cheesy moments and the love story is not a waste of time.  The production designs are just stunning in this movie.  From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter.  Even though this movie is over 40 years old, the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in todays cinema.  The music and songs are also well done.  Anyone who sees it will no doubt hail, I want to be a sailor sailing on the seas as one of the great musical moments in movies.  I am usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since I find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but I will be more than happy to make an exception for this movie.What sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you do not see in everyday life which is also the same reason why I love stuff like Two Towers and Silent Hill.  Way before todays modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic CGI to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place.  One of my favorite shots in Two Towers is the one where we see the trolls opening the Black Gates, the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor, and that is what I love about the Genie and other creatures in the movie.  They are just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they are all just fantasy beings.It is literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of Aladdin got their inspiration.  movie are characters in movie from Genie right It is not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it is nice to know that I am not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie.  I first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week I still think it is amazing.  That is a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time.  Sure, the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40s so give it a break.  Not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under todays standard.If you ever wanted to see a live action version of Aladdin then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this will not be their cup of tea.",

		"Watch On The Rhine started as a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still bound to Nazi Germany by that infamous nonaggression pact signed in August of 1939.  So much for the fact that Hellman was merely echoing the Communist party line, the line did not change until a couple of months later.  play Watch Roberts as Lucile as family matriarch Lillian was Roberts as Lucile as family matriarch Probably if the Tony Awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well.  The Oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy, and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie.  Every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was.  Lukass nomination is usually the kind the Academy gives to round out a field.Jack Warner knew that which is why Mady Christians did not repeat her Broadway part and the role of Lukass wife was given to Bette Davis.  Davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her, but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it.  It is the same reason she did The Man Who Came To Dinner, a much lighter play than this one.Davis is the daughter of a late American Supreme Court Justice who married a German national back in the Weimar days.  After many years of being vagabonds on the continent of Europe, Davis Lukas, and their three children come to America which has not yet entered the European War.  They are made welcome by Lucile Watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren.The fly in this ointment are some other house guests, a friend of Daviss from bygone days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe, a Rumanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris.  Coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects Lukass antifascist background.  His suspicions are quite correct, it is the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they have become.  Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there.  His health has not been the same since.  His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes.  Those decisions affect all the other members of the cast.Adding quite a bit more to the Broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was Dashiell Hammett who was Lillian Hellmans significant other.  Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy was a Hammett creation with such loathsome types as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders.Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account Runmanian count.  He was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the Nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after Stalingrad.Lucile Watson was up for Best Supporting Actress in 1943, but lost to Katina Paxinou in For Whom The Bell Tolls.  Dashiell Hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for Best Picture to that other antifascist classic, Casablanca.  Though it is an item firmly planted in those specific times, Watch On The Rhine still packs a stern antifascist message that bears repeating infinitely.",

If you are a purist, seeing people on stage smiling during the Sextet from Lucia will strike you as odd  even if Caruso as wife Dorothy just had a baby girl.  Also it is highly unlikely that Caruso ever sang Edgardo in Lucia; the role lay too high for him.In taking dramatic license, the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of Caruso as life.

He is thought to have had some trouble with high notes, further evidence of baritone leanings; and the role he was preparing when he died was Othello, a dramatic tenor role, which Lanza definitely was not.  Lanzas voice deserved not to be compared with another.  He made a unique contribution to film history, popularizing operatic music.

		"Since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio, I doubt we will ever get a real life story of Enrico Caruso.  But if everything else was in place it was no accident that no Hollywood studio attempted the task until MetroGoldwynMayer had Mario Lanza under contract.  No one else could have done it, I doubt whether it will ever be tried again.And why should it.  I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen.  For his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on the earth.  To say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest.  Caruso, like the man who portrayed him, was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline.  He had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film.  His contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought.  He is shown in a recording studio once late in his life.  Actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor made the recording industry what it became.When Caruso and McCormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live.  But a lot of immigrant Italian and Irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men.  It is why both became the legends that they are.What the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by Mario Lanza, a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a Caruso to stick to opera.  The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design.Mario himself helped popularize the film with an RCA Red Seal album of songs from The Great Caruso.  Lanza had Night of you for Enrico Caruso Lanza had Night of you for Enrico Caruso Lanza had Night of you for Enrico Caruso If you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career, than you should not miss The Great Caruso.",

		"THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at Radio City Music Hall in a year when most movergoers were stayathomes watching their new 7 Motorola televisions.  Almost all recent box office figures are false  because they fail to adjust inflation.  Obviously todays 10 movies will dominate.  it cost run at Loews in Washington DC What counts is the number of people responding to the picture, not unadjusted box office media spin.  The genius of THE GREAT CARUSO was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of Enrico Caruso really not a great story anyway and threw it in the trash.  Instead, 90 of the movies focus was on the music.  Thus MGM gave us the best living opera singer MARIO LANZA doing the music of the bestever historic opera singer ENRICO CARUSO.  The result was a wonderful movie.  Too bad LANZA would throw his life and career away on overeating.  Too fat to play THE STUDENT PRINCE, Edmund Purdom took his place  with Lanzas voice dubbed in, and with the formerly handsome and notfat Lanza pictured in the advertising.  If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO, it is almost always on eBay for 2.00 or less.  Do not be put off by the low price, as it reflects only the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the movie.",
		"American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna in order to take the plane for USA.  On the train he met a French girl Celine.  Although they met the first time, they talked like good friends.  When the train stopped at Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to accompany him to have a tour on Vienna.  Then the romantic story unfolded.At first they were cautious.  The funniest scene was their listening to CD in music store.  They peeked at each other, though their eyes did not contact.  After indepth conversation, they relationship became close.  Then I saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend.  Their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words.Love is a strange thing.  When you really want it, it will not come as you wished.  Love needs mutual understanding.  Without it, love will not last long.  performance resulted success of movie.One of romance movies",
		"I managed to catch a late night double feature last night of Before Sunrise 1995 and Before Sunset 2004, and saw both films in a row, without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately.  Sunrise introduces us with Dead at films release Sunrise introduces us with Dead at films release Sunrise introduces us with Dead at films release He is a promiscuous American writer, touring Europe after breaking up with his girlfriend; She is a young French student, on her way home to Paris.  They meet on the BudapestVienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together.  The two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of Vienna, exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love.The film has 1990s written all over it back then, technology was leaping rapidly, the new millennium with all it is hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner, and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future.  The characters of Jesse Hawke and Celine Delpy, with all their flaws and inconsistencies Celines accent, if by mistake or on purpose, was half Americanhalf French, and it swinged from one spectrum to the other, breaking the characters credibility, were a mirror of the time.  Watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement, acting all clich?d and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well, is what really made this movie work for me.  The fact that the director does not let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while.All in all, Sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of Vienna, a well told classical romantic rendezvous, and a film I will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future.",
		"Before Sunrise has many remarkable things going on, almost too many to fit into one review like this, but it is suffice to say that it is one of the most observant character studies of the nineties, maybe even in all of contemporary cinema, to be observant not about love, persay, so much as it is about a human connection.  How does one fall in love at first sight?  No one does, at least that is deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film.  And yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time.  Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie, a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna, and on the way there start to talking about things, at first arbitrary, then personal Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather.  Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the town, in Vienna, until his plane the next morning.Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine, in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance, and in a sense is about the act of having conversations, of what it is like to watch people having one leading into another and another.  Here it is often about relationships and commitments, as Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential, or seemingly so, and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities.  We hear confessions of desires for other loves, or what were not really loves, of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you will love your life, of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form, or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul I loved the bit about the quakers in the church, and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism.  it is Delpy in they in GenerationX mode it is Delpy in they in GenerationX mode it is Delpy in they in GenerationX mode it is Delpy in they in GenerationX mode The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter, only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other, where sweet asides are actually acceptable I have to tell you a secret, Jessie says, and then leans in for a kiss, hoho, or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way.  I loved the scene with the poet, where it is very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal, or with the palm reader and how the reactions from Jessie and Celine are that we might share, but really are seeing them do it firsthand.  All the while Hawke and Delpy embody the roles interestingly we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives as it may lead off into the future...Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness, however selfcontained, as it may lead into something more.  Who is to say you cannot suddenly be attached to someone, if only for less than 24 hours, and be that much more attached than a married couple?  This is perhaps Linklaters thesis, but there is more to it than just that.  It is a very dense film, and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly.  One scene especially, which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking on the phone in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the others friend.  A",

Jessie may be more responsible for that last part, but what is fascinating about the film is that it is never exactly cynical itself, just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives.Meanwhile, it is always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in these roles, where they are not incessantly annoying in that 90s GenerationX mode, but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film, which is not a bad one at all but a necessary one, one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere.  The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter, only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other, where sweet asides are actually acceptable I have to tell you a secret, Jessie says, and then leans in for a kiss, hoho, or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way.

		"This is truly truly one of the best movies about love that I have ever seen.  Closely followed by none other than Before Sunset, which technically is not another movie at all, since it is about the same two people and the same romance.This is love in the real world.  OK, that is only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie.  Reading the other reviews, it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialogbased movies as well.  And this is what makes Before Sunrise so good.  The dialog is perfect.  It is so real, so engaging and funny.  It is hardly a surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love, coz you fall in love with them at the very same time.My favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop, where they pretend to phone their best friends, with the other pretending to be said best friend.  It is PERFECT.  you fell love for time in your life.I you fell love for time in your life.I you fell love for time in your life.I If like me, you watched Sunset first, it is hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show.Once again, the greatest romantic movie in my books.  Wonderful acting, excellent script, and beautiful locations.  Young love, at it is best.",
		"Richard Linklaters beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and Paris travelogue is one of the 90s best thinking persons romantic movies.  Delpy turns performances as day with Ethan Hawke The dialogue and there is oodles of it is sometimes meandering and overly precious, but this portrait of two young wannabelovers making a romantic, intellectual, and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing, touching and insightful moments.",
		"First let me say that Before Sunrise, like all movies, is NOT a movie for all tastes.  It appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact, but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people.  For me, like most folks here, Before Sunrise struck a deep chord in me, I was truly stunned, moved, inspired by it.  This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing.  It creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine.  It is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings I got from it.The movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other.  It is significance of topics of Celines discussions It is significance of topics of Celines discussions It captures an honest, romantic, yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime Viennese milieu; it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world.  And what happens after that night is open for debate, but I never doubt that they will not each other again.The facile comments by RockytheBear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie.See it and it may change your way of life.",
		"we remember persons for rest of our lives we remember persons for rest of our lives These once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we do not meet these people anymore.  We do not always even know their names, as we are never presented to each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are.  It is funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such, because reuniting might spoil fond memories, or we do not know do they.  We are too afraid to check that out.The movie Before Sunrise just caught me watching it.  I never had intention to watch it through, but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting, I gave a look for the rest of the film.  I did not know what to expect from it, but nor did the young couple.  They had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate.  I believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through.  It makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives.",
		"Many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with The Mortal Storm or Casablanca.  Everyone is entitled to compare films they choose, but the similarities of The Mortal Storm and Watch On The Rhine are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the Nazi juggernaut, while the main comparative point brought out with Casablanca is the seeming unjust treatment of Humphrey Bogart in 1943 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science, because they chose Paul Lukas instead for the Best Actor Oscar.  It does not strike me as totally wrong.  Lukas had a good career in film both here and in England  he is the villain in The Lady Vanishes, and this performance was his best one.  Bogart had more great performances in him than Rick Blaine for instance, he was ignored for Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Roy Earle in High Sierra two years earlier, both of which were first rate performances, and he would not get an Oscar for his greatest performances as Fred C.  Dobbs in The Treasure Of Sierra Madres, the writermurder suspect in In A Lonely Place, and Captain Philip Francis Queeg in The Caine Mutiny afterward  he got it for Charley in The African Queen.  I think that Bogie should have got it for the role of Dobbs, but it did not happen.  But Lukas was lucky  he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career.  Few can claim that.To me the film to look at with Watch On The Rhine is based on another playscript by Hellman, The Searching Wind.  They both look at Americas spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s.  The Searching Wind is really looking at the whole interwar period, while Watch On The Rhine, set in the years just proceeding our entry into World War II, deals with a few weeks of time.  Therefore it is better constructed as a play, and more meaningful for it is impact.  film has Davis as his as plays activities It has dialog with bite in it.  And what it says is quite true.  It also has moments of near poetry.  Witness the scene, towards the end, when Coulouris is left alone with Lukas and Davis, and says, The New World has left the scene to the Old World.  Hellman could write very well at times.Given the strength of the film script and performances I would rate this film highly among World War II films."
