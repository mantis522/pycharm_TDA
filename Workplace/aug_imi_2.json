		"Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy.  It ran other programs My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell Highs satire is much closer to reality than is Teachers.

		"Homelessness or Houselessness as George Carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school, work, or vote for the matter.  Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism, the war on Iraq, pressuring kids to succeed, technology, the elections, inflation, or worrying if they will be next to end up on the streets.  But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home, the entertainment sets, a bathroom, pictures on the wall, a computer, and everything you once treasure to see what it is like to be homeless?  Bolt plays rival Jeffery he wants future project The bets on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he cannot step off the sidewalk.  He is given the nickname Pepto by a vagrant after it is written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of Molly Lesley Ann Warren an exdancer who got divorce before losing her home, and her pals Sailor Howard Morris and Fumes Teddy Wilson who are already used to the streets.  They are survivors.  Bolt is not.  He is not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it is fight or flight, kill or be killed.While the love connection between Molly and Bolt was not necessary to plot, I found Life Stinks to be one of Mel Brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy, it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or Spaceballs for the matter, to show what it is like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they do not know what to do with their money.  Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly money.Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others.",

		"This is easily the most underrated film inn the Brooks cannon.  Sure, its flawed.  It does realistic view Titanic gave realistic view It does realistic view Many of the jokes fall flat.  But still, this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not, and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive.  Its not The Fisher King, but its not crap, either.  My only complaint is that Brooks should have cast someone else in the lead I love Mel as a Director and Writer, not so much as a lead.",
		"This is not the typical Mel Brooks film.  It was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable.  Leslie Ann Warren made the movie, she is such a fantastic, underrated actress.  There were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more, and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so, but all in all, this is worth the price to rent and see it.  himself did characteristic speaking Again, Warren was the best actor in the movie, but Fume and Sailor both played their parts well.",
		"This is not the comedic Robin Williams, nor is it the quirkyinsane Robin Williams of recent thriller fame.  This is a hybrid of the classic drama without overdramatization, mixed with Robins new love of the thriller.  But this is not a thriller, per se.  Williams attempts sick boy It felt more like I was watching a guy Williams, as he was actually performing the actions, from a third person perspective.  In other words, it felt real, and I was able to subscribe to the premise of the story.All in all, it is worth a watch, though it is definitely not FridaySaturday night fare.It rates a 7.710 from...the Fiend .",

The sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film.  However, the core plot is very engaging.  The movie does not rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering.  The direction is good.  you are short story",

The Night Listener, despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release, is among his best work, period.This is a very chilling story, even though it does not include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter.  The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed.  In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result.  I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist.  When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker.  Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like Little Miss Sunshine.  There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me.  It takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it is this understated yet well reviewed role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an Academy Award as of 2008.  It is incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it is scary too.This is a good, dark film that I highly recommend.

		"I enjoyed The Night Listener very much.  It is one of the better movies of the summer.Robin Williams gives one of his best performances.  In fact, the entire cast was very good.  All played just the right notes for their characters  not too much and not too little.  Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch.  Toni Collette is great as the Mom, and never goes over the top.  Everyone is very believable.It is a short movie, just under an hour and a half.  I noticed general release I wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie.The director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion, which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well.Do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads.  It is not a Hitchcockian thriller.  See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story told well.  If you go expecting Hitchcock you will be disappointed.My only complaint with the movie was the ending.  The director could have left a little more to the audiences imagination, but this is a minor quibble.",

		"Like one of the previous commenters said, this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery.  Such a waste because Collettes performance was eerie and Williams was believable.  I just kept waiting for it to get better.  it was bad editing I do bad editing I do bad editing It came across as a Canadian movie, something like the first few seasons of XFiles.  Not cheap, just hokey.  Also, it needed a little more suspense.  Something that makes you jump off your seat.  The movie reached that moment then faded away; kind of like a false climax.  I can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the reality of the story but I thought that part was reached when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy.  This movie needs to have a Directors cut that tries to fix these problems.",

		"The Night Listener held my attention, with Robin Williams shining as a New York City radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy Rory Culkin who is very ill.  Williams has never met the boy in person, as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone.  However, Williams exboyfriend nice job from Bobby Cannavale raises doubt about the boy, which prompts Williams to arrange a meeting with him in person.  What follows makes a permanent impact on Williams in a way he does not expect.  I will leave it at that.  Toni Collette also stars.I enjoyed this film, with Toni Collette giving a memorable portrayal of Culkins adoptive mother.  Sandra Oh also starred as Williams friend.  it has creepy silence At times it is predictable, no thanks to some of the reviews I read before seeing the movie and just due to logic, but I liked it anyway.  I enjoy Williams in roles like this, more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me.  Recommended. 810",

The premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery, and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about.  us relate true nature The production felt rushed and holes are apparent.  It certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort.  The book is probably better.One thing is certain Taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort.",

I would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie.  Even though there was nothing scary about the story itself, I was soundly on edge through the whole movie  and for the rest of my evening.  I found that there were so many perfect choices made...the casting, the script, the little bits of humor sprinkled in it.  There were so many points where the film could have gone for the cheap thrill, but it never did, and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately...and for the last number of years.",

I think intriguing performances It has intriguing performances The whole thing feels like one of those fireside this happened to a friend of a friend of mine ghost stories.  One big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate.  Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility, and real life just sort of plods alongno?  So there are no flashy endings or earthshattering revelations, no showdown scenes.  Thank Heaven.  You have to get into the zone when watching this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a conventionallygood movie.  Williams is not terrific, but he easily meets the needs of the story, plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic No One as he is the Everyman, the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story.  Toni Collettes performance should be nominated for an Oscar even if she maybe should not win it.  Give it a shot.

Let us go over a quick checklist first 1.  Great plot?  Absolutely.

This is a thriller, not a horror, and it should be approached as such.  The story really will amaze you, even more so because it is true and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events.2.

Excellent direction?  Certainly.  Now, unlike the other poster to which I referred, I actually know something about direction.  I have been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years.  Of course I really do not think that makes a lick of difference the only thing that matters is if YOU like the direction, but I thought I should simply establish once again that I am basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant...for example not the sexual orientation of the director or the alleged drug habits of the production team, LOL.Patrick Stettners direction was moody and dark, and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those sosoughtafter feelings of tension and release rather than the messy, fastpaced camerawork and quick cuts we are so often subjected to today.  Some people can truly show you a story through their camera, while others feel as if they have to make the story with the camera.  I really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized, which is as an eyeball through which we all see.4.

Do not listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it, especially if they are so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 14 of the way through their post.  Enjoy the show!  Ben",

		"The legendary Boris Karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in Mexico.  This is the token moody period Gothic horror entry from the bunch.  Karloff gives nocount relatives Pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal lifesized toy people who populate the place.  Onetime Mexican sex symbol Andres Garcia of Tintorera infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and Julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character.  The clunky, plodding nondirection, trite bythenumbers script, ugly, washedout cinematography, ridiculous murder set pieces a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon! , overwrought string score, morbid gloomdoom atmosphere, largely lousy acting Karloff notably excepted, cheesy mild gore, poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm.  A real campy hoot.",

In ARo he follows the same line, but really improved on the rhythm, especially in the end of the movie.  Frankly speaking, I slept through the first part, cause though the first part gives necessary information, it is really slow.

Let us just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really, really great done.  It 's white shots Aro Tolbukhin it´s like a movie made a documental or viceversa, which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering, did he really ever existed?  The movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in Guatemala, worked in a religious mission and then killed some people.  An act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced.  The movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death.  Nowadays, some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character.  The one we are witness of the movie.For the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside Aro´s mind, mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done.  Nevertheless, the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view; they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions, we clearly never justify them.  So, the first half is based upon recollecting information; later things turn into Aros childhood, giving the movie such an incredible new force even tough never got weak or boring.I do not mean and do not want to spoil anything; so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you, believe me, the trip to see it is more than worthy.",

		"Sure, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change.  The first time you see the movie you see the underlying lovestory and think ooh, how romantic.  The second time and I am not the only one to think this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, When is this dn ship going to sink???  you see several times The acting in this film is not bad, but definetly not great either.  Was I glad DiCaprio did not win an oscar for that film, I mean who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington?  He does 1 halfgood movie and will not do a film for less than 20 million.  And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it.  But enough about, in my eyes, the worst character of the film.  Kate Winslet us performance on the other hand was wonderful.  I also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together.  There is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many lovestories as it is, filmmakers should not try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie!!!  Out of a possible 100 I give this film a mere 71.",

There is nothing wrong with this movie.  All I can say is that this movie, not only being the most heavily Oscar Awarded movie of all time, the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies I have ever seen.  Apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time.  The only movies that come close to being like all the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings trilogy or anything by the masters Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton.

As has been mentioned, the lowbudget telemovie status of 13 GANTRY ROW is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal.  Having said that however the thing is not without merit  either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se.True, the plot at its most basic is a reworking of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR  only without much horror.  More a case of intrigue!  she had main suspect The script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard.  It just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments.Having picked the DVD up for a mere 3.95 last week at my regular video store, I cannot begrudge the expenditure. 10.95 would be an acceptable price for the film.

		"What is inexplicable?  Firstly, the hatred towards this movie.  It may not be the greatest movie of all time, but gimme a break, it got 11 oscars for a reason, it made EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS for a reason.  It is good movie Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it.  I have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when I saw it in theaters.  I have rewatched it on TV and video, and it had none of the impact it had when I saw it on the big screen twice, or maybe three times, actually.  But that might be it, the appeal of it.  It is a Movie, yes, capital M there, it is an Epic, it is a spectacle in the order of Gone With the Wind or Ben Hur.  Now, Ben Hur and Gone With the Wind seem kinda hokey to me, with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama.  Not that Titanic has none of that.  Well, the acting was actually very good.  The melodrama was quite heavyhanded at times.But the reason Titanic works is that it is such an emotional ride.  I usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind, or give me a visual thrill.  This movie is not exactly dumb, but it is not cerebral at all.  The visual thrills are simply means to an end, to fuel the emotions of the audience.  I did not cry when Bambis mom died, I do not react to tearjerkers.  But this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million, an emotional rollercoaster that, if it were a regular one, would make Buzz Aldrin scream like a little girl.  And I am sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it, and have a ready supply of cynicism, then you can thoroughly dislike this movie.  But if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit, if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt, you will enjoy it completely.  And look at the top ten grossing films of all time.  Is a single one of them bad?  Is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10?  No, not even The Phantom Menace.  And this movie made 1.8 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide.  It cannot be bad.  Not possible. 1010.p.s. how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman?  spiderman was a fun movie, but it was a total 911 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did. it simply was not anything all that special. no one will remember it in 50 years. but i am pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.",

WHAT DO ALL OF THESE FILMS HAVE IN COMMON WITH TITANIC?  ALL OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE LOWER !!!!  THAN TITANIC, AND NONE OF THESE STINKERS EVER WAS NOMINATED FOR A SINGLE AWARD.  Again, Titanic got 10.7 1 ratings!  Compare that to the other 5 movies I just mentioned.Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo factor?",
		"I loved this movie since I was 7 and I saw it on the opening day.  It was so touching and beautiful.  I strongly recommend seeing for all.  It is thematic elements",
		"The movie Titanic makes it much more then just a night to remember.  It re tragic history Why so criticised?  I have no idea.  Couldwill they ever make a movie like Titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it.  Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece.  It will be almost impossible.The director no doubt had the major impact on the film.  A simple disaster film boring to watch converted to an unbelievable romance.  Yes I am not the Romance type either, but that should not bother you, because you will never see a romance like this.  Guaranteed!  Everything to the amazing effects, to the music, to the sublime acting.  The movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling.  Everything looks very real and live.  The legend herself TITANIC is shown brilliantly in all classes, too looks, too accommodation.  The acting was the real effect.  Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best at playing there roles.  No one could have done better.  They are partly the reason why the film is so great.  I guess it is not too much to talk about.  The plot is simple, The acting is brilliant, based on a true story, Probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears, thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten.  Well if you have not seen this film your missing out on something Hesterical, and a film to idolise for Hollywood.  Could it get better?  No.  Not at all.  The most moving film of all time, do not listen to people, see for yourself then you will understand.  A landmark. do not be surprised if you cry too",
		"I had few problems I had few problems True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly.  I do not think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent.  The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus.  Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose.  David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he is in.  The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow.  The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank.  I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving.  The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On.  The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies.  Overall, I give Titanic an 8.510.  Bethany Cox.",

		"I think second review Anyway, everyone remembers the RMS Titanic.  It was big, fast, and unsinkable... until April 1912.  It was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever.  Well James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship.  Well, onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film.So our two main characters are Jack Leonardo DiCaprio and Rose Kate Winslet.  They are not annoying too much but watch this and you will find out why they could become annoying  httptinyurl.comojhoyn .  The main villain I guess is bad luck, fate, hand of God no blasphemy intended, or just plain Caledon Hockley Billy Zane.  Combine all of the above and what do you get?!  Oh yes!  We get a love story on a sinking boat.  The supporting characters are the following My personal favorite, Mr.  Andrews Victor Garberidk he was so nice, LovejoyDavid Warner, MurdochEwan Stewart, Lightoller Jonathan Phillips, Captain SmithBernard Hill, Molly BrownKathy Bates, and many more.  We also got the present day treasure hunter, Brock Lovett Bill Paxton.  They add something to the story, something good.  The action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good.  In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears.  The story is simple and it works.  A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond.  She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic.  Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship.  Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws.  I give Titanic, an 86 awesome",

		"Titanic is unsinkable ship WriterDirector James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic.  The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.  They make for a good onscreen couple.  DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable.  They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well.  The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film.  The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time.  The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation.  The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it is few flaws.  Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it.  The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg.  Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the illfated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.",

		"The ship may have sunk but the movie did not!!!  Director, James Cameron, from The Terminator did it again with this amazing picture.  One of my favorite scenes is The Dinner table scene, in which Roses family and friends meet Jack after he saves her.  I am future husband.Jack I have future husband.Jack I hope future husband.Jack it is good movie I hope good movie Rose has good movie We have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth.  Rose almost commits suicide but the Gilbert Grape star rescues her.  I really liked the hanging over the boat scene.  It was a good risk.The movie is long but it is fantastic!!!  Good story, good flow, good actors!!!  Go see it twice if you want, Its worth it!!!",

		"Titanic has favorite movies It has its problems what movies do not but still, it is enjoyable.When I stumble across someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is wait a minute, you do not?  I know so many people who do not like this movie, and I am not saying I do not see why.  The love story is too cheesy well, yes but is not it enjoyable and moving?  All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this does not actually exist.  But this is a movie, does not everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while?  The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors.  Well, OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials.  However I think it is unfair to say that they are terrible actors.  I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in.  But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.And finally, if one is going to complain that they do not like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I am sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things.  It is like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies.  Simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this IS a good movie.Well deserving of its Oscars, in particular, Best Cinematography, which I find to be the best I have ever seen in a movie save maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogy.I know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each others names throughout the movie.  The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it is an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults.  The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.I give this movie 1010, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it is an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.",

Simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this IS a good movie.Well deserving of its Oscars, in particular, Best Cinematography, which I find to be the best I have ever seen in a movie save maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogy.I know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each others names throughout the movie.  The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it is an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults.  The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.I give this movie 1010, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it is an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.",

		"Titanic is a classic.  I was really surprised that this movie did not have a solid ten, overall in the IMDb user rankings.  Maybe, it is just cool to not give Titanic credit nowadays, but when it was first made it was really something.  When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters.  When it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month.  we were good reason It was good reason Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot, like the frozen baby, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd.  Many people died on that ship, and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that James Cameron stepped up to.  And let us not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose.  Whether or not their relationship was a figment of someones imagination it was lovely.  They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other.  They trusted each other.  They sure as hell are giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money.  I will never let go, Jack.  Titanic is a great film down to it is very core.  It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music, and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers.  It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie.",

		"Another Aussie masterpiece, this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and it does very well.  It does American flicks It does emotional impact A relatively simple plot that Rebecca Gibney  Co. bring to life.  It follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside, and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago.  Strange things begin to happen in the house, and John Adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared, who was actually a mass murderer.  Highly recommended. 810",

		"For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time.  No exceptions.  James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller.  Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and sciencefiction goes.  He sees strange quality But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance.  The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows.  The story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a truthful, interesting and entertaining film about it.  The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters are not given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly Rose Gloria Stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is Roses and Jacks story alone, no one else.  Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home.  The music has become iconic and legendary.  It is composer James Horners finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience.  The song after so long has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is.  Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside.  James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime.  My heart will not go on from this one.",
		"Clinton bans unfortunate death This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster.  I do not think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85 of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times.  It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful.  At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and did not watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now.  Was it worth the hype?  Was it really the best movie of all time?  Was that Leonardos real nose?  OK, I know that is silly to say, but I did rewatch the film.  Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, best movie of all time, no, just depends on your idea of a good movie, but Titanic delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean.  Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude, wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101yearold Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing.  She and her granddaughter Elizabeth Lizzy Calvert visit Lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship.  When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater.  In 1912, the upperclass 17yearold Rose boards the ship with her fianc?, Cal Hockley and her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, both of whom stress the importance of Roses engagement to Cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the DewittBukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upperclass, Rose and her mother are financially broke.  Distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling Cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern.  Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes.  Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy firstclass formal dinner of the rapportbuilding wealthy for a much livelier gathering of Irish dance, music and beer in thirdclass.  But after Cals servant informs him of Roses whereabouts, Rose is forbidden from seeing Jack again.  However, after witnessing a woman encouraging her sevenyearold daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea, Rose defies him and her mother, asking Jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the Heart of the Ocean, an engagement present from Cal.  After a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time, they go to the deck of the ship.They then witness the ships fatal collision with an iceberg.  After overhearing the ships lookouts discussing how serious the collision is, Rose tells Jack they should warn her mother and Cal.  Meanwhile, Cal discovers Roses nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe, so he frames Jack for stealing the Heart of the Ocean by having Lovejoy plant it in Jacks pocket.  Upon learning Cal intends to leave Jack to die below deck, Rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him.  Jack and Rose return to the top deck.  Cal and Jack, though enemies, both want Rose safe, so they persuade her to board a lifeboat.  But after realizing that she cannot leave Jack, Rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with Jack in the ships first class staircase.  Jack and Rose return to the top deck, the lifeboats have gone, and the ship finally goes down into the freezing Atlantic taking Jack and Rose down.So does Titanic live up to it is hype?  I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie.  But it has great acting, amazing effects, a wellwritten story and still looks flawless.  Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie did not get a lot of hype just because of Leos baby face or Kates amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special.  It will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too seeing that I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released.  But all that aside, I do recommend this movie, it is a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.1010",

I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie.  But it has great acting, amazing effects, a wellwritten story and still looks flawless.  Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie did not get a lot of hype just because of Leos baby face or Kates amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special.  It will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too seeing that I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released.  But all that aside, I do recommend this movie, it is a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.1010",

At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and did not watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now.  Was it worth the hype?  Was it really the best movie of all time?  Was that Leonardos real nose?  OK, I know that is silly to say, but I did rewatch the film.

Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it.

		"Titanic directed historical setting The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense.  The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal Billy Zane.  Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack Leonardo DiCaprio, a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York.  Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson.  Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanics legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 1139, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanics many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too.  The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanics officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaires Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown.  As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss.  Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs.  Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr.  Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat.  In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware.  The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the PostVictorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to new money such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes.  Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes.  Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society.  Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.  The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives.  Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night.  In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.  At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic.  Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it does not take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture.  Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing.  If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.",

With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York.  she is wealthy Cal Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanics legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 1139, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanics many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too.  The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanics officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaires Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown.  As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss.  Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs.  Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr.  Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat.  In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware.  The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the PostVictorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to new money such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes.  Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes.  Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society.  Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.  The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives.  Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night.  In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.  At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic.  Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it does not take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture.  Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing.  If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.",
		"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.

In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.

Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.

		"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense.  The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal Billy Zane.  Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack Leonardo DiCaprio, a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York.  Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson.  Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanics legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 1139, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanics many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too.  The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  they represent different groups Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanics officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaires Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown.  As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss.  Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs.  Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr.  Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat.  In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware.  The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the PostVictorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to new money such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes.  Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes.  Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society.  Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.

The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanics officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaires Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown.  As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss.  Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs.  Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.

The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat.  In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.

Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.

The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives.  he gets fateful night Everyone reacts fateful night In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.  At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic.  Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it does not take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture.  Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing.  If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.",
		"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense.  The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal Billy Zane.  Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack Leonardo DiCaprio, a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York.  Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson.  Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanics legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 1139, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanics many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too.  The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.

The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaires Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown.  As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss.  Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs.  Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr.  Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.

		"I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie!  Obviously this movie was not THAT bad or else people would not even BOTHER to talk about it.  I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do!  I guess this film is not for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many.  As for those that think that this film is overrated or overhyped...well, we only have the moviegoing public to thank for that!  lol You see, it is not CRITICSarticle writers that make a film HUGE or a HIT with the general moviegoing public.  PEOPLE make huge success With Titanic, everyone was in awe.  Let us face it, a film like this had never been made before.  At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking.  This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912.  Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched!  Give this movie a break you guys!  The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time!  When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you that this was a gooddecentmovie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more!  So, I really would not say that this movie was overhyped...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being overhyped. ha!  Critics did not even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Camerons gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film.  However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more!  Personally, I LOVE this film.  However, this film might not be for everyone.  Do not say that this film sucks just because of romance though!  THat is the most sexist thing I have ever heard!  Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it!  The story was sweet.  The dialogue could have been better, but let us face it...the REAL star of the movie was not Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship!  I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job.  It is not thier best work I have seen much BETTER work from both of them but it was not the WORST I have seen on screen before.  Give them a break!",

		"I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie!  Obviously this movie was not THAT bad or else people would not even BOTHER to talk about it.  I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do!  I guess this film is not for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many.  As for those that think that this film is overrated or overhyped...well, we only have the moviegoing public to thank for that!  lol You see, it is not CRITICSarticle writers that make a film HUGE or a HIT with the general moviegoing public.  PEOPLE make the film a huge success.  With Titanic, everyone was in awe.  Let us face it, a film like this had never been made before.  At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking.  This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912.  Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched!  Give this movie a break you guys!  The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time!  When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you that this was a gooddecentmovie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more!  So, I really would not say that this movie was overhyped...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being overhyped. ha!  Critics did not even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Camerons gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film.  However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more!  Personally, I LOVE this film.  However, this film might not be for everyone.  Do not say that this film sucks just because of romance though!  THat is the most sexist thing I have ever heard!  Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it!  The story was sweet.  The dialogue could have been better, but let us face it...the REAL star of the movie was not Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship!  I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job.  I have much BETTER It is much BETTER It is much BETTER Give them a break!",
		"I avoided watching this film for the longest time.  Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an overhyped, overblown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it.  I never watched it in the theatre.  I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards  even though I had never seen it.  Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest.  One of the girls spoke about this movie.  It was so great, she said.  You really felt like you were on the ship.  Nonsense, I thought.  I shared fellow judges One looked at me and said, you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she will want to learn more about the real Titanic.  The movie must have done something right to get her so interested.  Well, maybe, thought I.  Then it finally appeared on Pay TV.  OK, I thought, I will give it a look see.  I did not want to like it  and I did not.  I loved it!  What a great movie.Where to start?  First  the directing.  My high school public speaking contestant was right.  James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere.  The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world.  The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic.  You do not just watch it; you really do feel it.  Then  the performances.  The lead performances from Kate Winslet as Rose and Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack are excellent  Winslet us being the superior, I thought, but both were good.  They had their rich girlpoor boy characters down to a perfect t I thought.  In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Roses mother.  She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack.  Then  the details.  I am no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance.  Very impressive, indeed.  Then  the song.  Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dions performance of My Heart Goes On.Problems.  Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just do not accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class.  I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he is been there for a while.  The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.  A minor quibble, though.  This is truly an excellent movie.  My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.910",

I know same people I pay same people And they are too embarrassed now to admit it.I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time.  Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years.  I cried again.... in all the same places.  It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time.  A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall yes, even more than Star Wars.  And today, many people will not even admit they enjoyed it.  Folks, let us get something straight  you do not look cool when you badmouth this film.  You look like an out of touch cynic.No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults.  Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly.  However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful.  Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation.  Wait til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy.  Kate Winslet was so strong in this film.  The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic.  The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night.  How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me.  I was utterly transfixed.This film is one memorable scene after another.  Titanic leaving port in Southampton.  Rose and Jack at the bow, flying.  Iceberg, right ahead!  The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean.  The screams of the doomed after she went down.  And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.The music, which has also been a victim of the films success, was a key ingredient.  James Horners score was simply perfect.  And the love theme was beautiful and tragic.  Too bad Celine Dions pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.I confess, I am a Titanic buff.  As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it  in all its beauty.  Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I have had such an interest in the ship all my life.  However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs.  I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy.  The film was made with such humanity.Another reviewer said it better than I ever could Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.",

Folks, let us get something straight  you do not look cool when you badmouth this film.  You look like an out of touch cynic.No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults.

		"After a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted, urban, turn of the century Australian street, we meet Julie Rebecca Gibney and Peter John Adam as they go out house hunting.  They manage posh Sydney it turns physical disrepair They manage physical disrepair It just may be haunted.13 Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clich?d story with good to average direction by Catherine Millar into a slightly above average shocker.The biggest flaws seem partially due to budget, but not wholly excusable to that hurdle.  A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film.  The opening thriller scene features some wonky editing.  Freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there is not much action.  Suspense should be created from staging, not fancy fix it in the mix techniques.  There is great atmosphere in the scene from the location, the lighting, the fog and such, but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim, cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street, showing their increasing proximity.  The tracking and the cuts need to be slow.  The attack needed to be longer, clearer and better blocked.  As it stands, the scene has a strong made for television feel, and a low budget one at that.After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves.  The story has a lot of similarities to The Amityville Horror 1979, though the budget forces a much subtler approach.  Millar and scriptwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios, often dramatic in nature instead of special effectsoriented, such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron, which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall.For some horror fans, the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama.  At least the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in.  But Morphett writes fine, intelligent dialogue.  The material is done well enough that it is often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise laterespecially if you have gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house.Once they get settled and things begin to get weirder, even though the special effects often leave much to be desired, the ideas are good.  The performances help create tension.  There is not an abundance of death and destruction in the filmthere is more of an abundance of home repair nightmares.  But neither menace is really the point.The point is human relationships.  There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting.  The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it.  That it is in a posh neighborhood, and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies, shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe, such as money or health problems.  Peters character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal workbased friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive, scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful.  At the same time, we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be.  Julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown, but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship.Although 13 Gantry Row never quite transcends its madefortelevision clunkiness, as a TV movie, this is a pretty good one, with admirable ambitions.  Anyone fond of haunted house films, psycho films or horrorthrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy.  It certainly is not worth spending 30 for a DVD that was the price my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling, but it is worth a rental, and it is definitely worth watching for free.",

One man, Daddy, has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity.  The kids grow up,one all be it, in the hard way, to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is, the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall.

You will soon forget that it is shot in black  white.  The cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years.

Anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much.I think this movie was way ahead of its time.  The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination, opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown.I have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here.

		"It was serious attempt Therese is sweet Isabelle It was heterosexual experience The imagery is effective, but sometimes the camera lingers too long, and the story goes slowly The director, Radley Metzger, went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of Henry Paris He always has extremely detailed stories, good acting, and very high standards of cinematography...Artistically, however, this is perhaps his most complete His later attempts supplied for entertainment, whereas Therese and Isabelle was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism...",
		"It was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact Even by todays standards, the film is interesting and provocative Therese and Isabelle are both attending the same girls school Therese is energetic, intelligent, and becomes a mentor for the innocent, naive, sweet Isabelle She guides her through a number of exotic experiences, including a trip through an exclusive brothel, into her first lesbian liaison, and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience The film does not exploit any sex, nor is there an abundance of nudity...  Isabelle was youthful eroticism",

She was such a great actor for being so little.  Maybe the fact it was in Chinese, so the English was dubbed made it harder for me to tell...but she really seemed to be in character perfectly.  I felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her boss but everything just turned out rotten. lol.  Even when she brings him another grandson, just so he can pass on his art...it turns out that kid was kidnapped, so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live. lol...whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa, just backfires.In the end, he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks...which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie.Definitely a gem, and totally original.Scott",

		"I admit reluctant guardian I have seen enough of them  Baby Boom, Kolya, About a Boy, Mostly Martha, and to some extent, Whale Rider  to expect to be bored by the formula.

When Wang discovers his purchased grandson, whom he is nicknamed Doggie, is a granddaughter, he initially casts her out, even though she is showed great promise as streetperforming heir.  Even after he reluctantly takes her back, he is not too upset when she is kidnapped.  The film is gritty then, showing the lengths to which a young, streetsmart girl had to go to survive in that society.The two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context.  In a Western society, one would expect at least a hint of resentment from Wang at not having achieved more material success.  Wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status, though, that I did, too.  While Doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern, suburban child, it is completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage.  And after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her, her fierce attachment to Wang makes perfect sense.The peek at smalltown life in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two lead actors, the surprising plot twists, and of course, the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film.",

Even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war, this could still be any time in the past 150 years.But then we briefly see a motor car  late 30s, early 40s style  and we realise that we are watching a China on the verge of huge upheavals, and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of World War 2 and the Communist revolution.Which makes the central characters desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant.But the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today, both within China and in other parts of the world the inequality between boys and girls, men and women; the trade, for various purposes, in young children; corruption in society; injustice; the importance of friendship.Maybe I am reading too much into this film; but I do not think so!

		"Robert A.  Heinleins classic novel Starship Troopers has been messed around with in recent years, in everything to Paul Verhoevens 1997 film to a TV series, to a number of games.  But none of these, so to speak, has really captured the spirit of his novel.  The games are usually unrelated, the TV series was more of a spin off, and the less said about Verhoevens film, the better.  Little do most know, however, that in Japan, an animated adaptation had already been done, released the year of Heinleins death.  And, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6part animated series is, plotwise, the most faithful adaptation of Heinleins classic.The most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons, something we were deprived of in Verhoevens film.  we see fair amount While events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the books plot is present.  Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it is only slightly more touched upon than in the book.  While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book it gets a bit of the anime treatment, but what did you expect? , but it is far superior to the film.  Heinleins political views are merely excised, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed.  The big payoff of the series, however, is the climatic battle on Klendathu between the troopers and the bugsaliens, which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.Overall, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein.  And I think they did pretty well with this.  If you can find this series, give it a look.",

		"Masks is many levels At its simplest, it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art masks to the next generation.  Although, at times the story makes the old man into a Job, it is so well crafted written, acted, directed, wonderful production values, it is easy to move beyond his plight.

From there, we follow them through the rigors of their challenging, but free life along the river.  Traveling town to town, he performs and has some degree of notoriety.  Despite the times and the influences, the man is kind and good.Overall, the performances are first rate, especially Xu Zhu, who portrays the street performer.  The child Renying Zhou is beautiful, and downright strong, and withstands the overt prejudices well.  The two protagonists, along with supporting help from the kind opera singer, Master Liang an interestingly androgynous Zhao Zhigang, paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness, sadness and love.  Some have mentioned this films remote similarities to BA WANG BIE JI FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE; yet this film cannot stand easily on its own, any resemblance is remote at best.My only qualm with the KING OF MASKS, is the ending.  It was weak, cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer.  The audience was already wrapped up in the story, what was the needless manipulation for?  What a shame.  To bring a fine motion picture that far, only to surrender to emotional and corny pathos like that.  It frankly made this film good, instead of the classic, it should have been.  That aside, the KING OF MASKS is still very well worth your time.  I was happy to see the Shaw Brothers are still producing good films.  Highly recommended.",

The child Renying Zhou is beautiful, and downright strong, and withstands the overt prejudices well.  The two protagonists, along with supporting help from the kind opera singer, Master Liang an interestingly androgynous Zhao Zhigang, paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness, sadness and love.  Some have mentioned this films remote similarities to BA WANG BIE JI FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE; yet this film cannot stand easily on its own, any resemblance is remote at best.My only qualm with the KING OF MASKS, is the ending.  It was weak, cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer.  The audience was already wrapped up in the story, what was the needless manipulation for?  What a shame.  To bring a fine motion picture that far, only to surrender to emotional and corny pathos like that.  It frankly made this film good, instead of the classic, it should have been.  That aside, the KING OF MASKS is still very well worth your time.  I was good films Highly recommended.",
		"I enjoyed beautiful film The story is simple.  An older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children.  The faces of the actors are marvelous to see.  The story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well.  The operas in the film remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more sophisticated and intricate.  The story here reminds me of a Dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel.  The plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism, humanity, and history portrayed.",

		"This is a beautiful, rich, and very wellexecuted film with a rich and meaningful story.  he expected maledominated world The characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and societys traditional notions.The story is fun, emotional, and complex.  The exploration of the characters, their lives, and emotions, is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all.  The film expertly conveys the old mans emotions and his desire to find an heir, and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation.  There is also humour, sometimes quite subtle, at appropriate points.  The film also examines the good and bad of traditional Chinese culture, creating further interest and depth to the film.The directing, acting, and scenery are all outstanding.  Added to the other strengths, this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling, real characters.  As a result, the film evokes strong empathy for, and feelings about, the characters.Some have claimed that the ending weakens the film, but I do not necessarily agree.  Perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending, but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small.",
		"The movie is truly poignant, unique and uplifting.  The story is universal in that it is a battle between good, evil and the world between.  THE MOST IMPORTANT thing is that its rating is wrong, misleading, and a travesty.  Blockbuster has it rated as though it were an X rated movie.  it is simple subtitles",
		"This spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen.  it shows REAL light I believe REAL light It shows REAL light It is absolutely heartbreaking in so many situations, seeing how hard life was for the characters, and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful.

I simply can not recommend this movie highly enough.  It may just change you forever once you have seen it.",

After all, no elephants are shown being killed during the movie; it is not even implied that any are hurt.  To the contrary, the master of ELEPHANT WALK, John Wiley Peter Finch, complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachydermsno matter how menacingwithout a permit from the government and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability.  Furthermore, the elements conspirein the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemicto leave the Wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the Elephant People as the natives dub them to close the story.  you happen current release",

		"Elephant Walk first time I watched superior Rebecca As others have said, you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the manor, only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a largerthanlife yet deeply flawed relative.  You have the stern and disapproving servant, a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart, climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homestead.Meanwhile, Elephant Walk also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to The Letter, the Bette Davis love triangle set on a Singapore rubber plantation rather than a Sri Lankan tea plantation.Maltin gives Elephant Walk just two stars, and IMDb readers are not much kinder, but I enjoyed it despite its predictability.  Elizabeth Taylor never looked lovelier, and Peter Finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father.  Dana Andrews  a favorite in Laura and The Best Year of Our Lives  is wasted as Elizabeths frustrated admirer.  The real star is the bungalow, one of the most beautiful interior sets in movie history.",

Upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd.  I have gorgeous island",
		"herself married British Ceylon Although based upon the book by Robert Standish, this initial setup is highly reminiscent of Hitchocks Rebecca, with leading lady Elizabeth Taylor clashing with the imposing chief of staff at the mansion and almost immediately her own husband, who is still under the thumb of his deceasedbutdominant father.  Taylor, a lastminute substitute for an ailing Vivien Leigh, looks creamysmooth in her high fashion wardrobe, and her performance is quite strong; however, once husband Peter Finch starts drinking heavily and barking orders at her, one might think her dedication to him rather masochistic this feeling hampers the ending as well.  Still, the film offers a heady lot for soap buffs romantic drama, a bit of travelogue, interpretive dance, an elephant stampede, and a perfectlytimed outbreak of cholera!   from ",
		"it is great entertainment It is the story of love, both genuine and illicit, as well as overweening ambition, devotion, and the arrogance of personal tyranny.  A previous reviewer, John Mankin, questions why the central focus of the film, the mansion called Elephant Walk, should have been built by the former owner, the governor the late Tom Wiley, right across the elephants traditional path to the major source of water, the river.  To miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film the hubris of man.  That his son, played by Peter Finch, should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father, is not unexpected, since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his fathers rowdy boys club as his role models.  The point of the father was that he was a selfmade man who would tame nature to his liking, and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated, but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd, and thus he would dominate his son and all around him, and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water.  Who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water?  This is the nexus of the film what will animals do to get water; what will humans do to get power or love?  Ceylon, todays Sri Lanka, is the huge island off the coast of India where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story, not just the expenses of Miss Taylor.  Were it not for this exotic location much of the film was shot in Ceylon, and the magnificent bungalow this would have been just another potboiler.  One must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place, as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the English immigrant conquerors that were part and parcel of the British raj.  It is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony, teak, and marble.  Not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved Jalees grille work window and doorway borders evidently specified by art directors J.  McMillan Johnson and Hal Pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island.  Such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought.For those immune to the blandishments of time, place, and architecture, there is always the allure of Miss Taylor, as she marries a man she does not really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man, against the background described, and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased.  As I said, it is not great literature nor even great film, but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today.This is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drivein, not on the home TV, so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camerawork and scope.",

		"ELEPHANT WALK may not be the acme of literature or of film, but it is great entertainment in the quasimelodramatic mode.  It is the story of love, both genuine and illicit, as well as overweening ambition, devotion, and the arrogance of personal tyranny.  A previous reviewer, John Mankin, questions why the central focus of the film, the mansion called Elephant Walk, should have been built by the former owner, the governor the late Tom Wiley, right across the elephants traditional path to the major source of water, the river.  To miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film the hubris of man.  That his son, played by Peter Finch, should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father, is not unexpected, since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his fathers rowdy boys club as his role models.  The point of the father was that he was a selfmade man who would tame nature to his liking, and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated, but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd, and thus he would dominate his son and all around him, and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water.  Who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water?  This is the nexus of the film what will animals do to get water; what will humans do to get power or love?  Ceylon, todays Sri Lanka, is the huge island off the coast of India where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story, not just the expenses of Miss Taylor.  Were it not for this exotic location much of the film was shot in Ceylon, and the magnificent bungalow this would have been just another potboiler.  One must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place, as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the English immigrant conquerors that were part and parcel of the British raj.  It is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony, teak, and marble.  Not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved Jalees grille work window and doorway borders evidently specified by art directors J.  McMillan Johnson and Hal Pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island.  Such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought.For those immune to the blandishments of time, place, and architecture, there is always the allure of Miss Taylor, as she marries a man she does not really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man, against the background described, and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased.  it is great spectacle",
		"My parents took me to this movie when I was nine years old.  I have never forgotten it.  I had never before seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor.  She was twentytwo when she made Elephant Walk Remember, I am nine, so the feelings are not sexual, I just could not see anything else on the screen.  I just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her.  She is breathtaking women it is sappy melodrama She has sappy melodrama What saves it is, of course, Miss Taylors beauty, magnificent scenery, the very impressive elephant stampede, and a wellmade point on human arrogance in the face of nature.All in all, a wellspent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video.",
		"One of the first OVAs original video animation I ever bought, this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles.  A cyberpunk scifi action comedy set against an unlikely for a comedy, that is background of nearfuture pollution in a dystopian society.The heroes of Dominion are the Tank Police, formed with a if we cannot beat crime, we will get bigger guns philosophy, and who are, like the name suggests, patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars, and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch.  Most, if not all, of these cops are borderline?  psychopaths and neurotics, giving new meaning to the phrase loose cannons.Equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries, terrorist Buaku and his henchwomen, the Twin Cat Sisters, whose existence always seems to involve giving the Tank Police a hard time.The animation is not state of the art, but it is very nice otherwise; the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of Dominion.The English dubbing is, again, lots of fun.  The soundtrack of the English version is also very good.  I wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that...Anyway, Dominion Tank Police is great.  It is Japanese cyberpunk Highly recommended.",
		"The anime that got me hooked on anime...Set in the year 2010 hey, that is not too far away now!  the Earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence.  Seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists, the government of the fictional New Port City form the Tank Police to deal with the problem  cops with tanks!  Oh the insanity! The heroes of this series include the new recruit Leona Ozaki, a red haired Japanese woman yeah I know, they never match their distinctly Japanese names with a Japanese appearance who has just been drafted into the Tank Police and is quickly partnered with blond, blue eyed nice guy Al.  Leona is nifty sunglasses Britain did not like having Leona join the Tank Police in the first place and her wrecking his Tiger Special a giant green monster tank does not exactly endear her to him, nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a minitank that she nicknames Bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare where the boys are more your size as he puts it.  There is also Specs, the bifocal genius, Bible quotingGod fearing Chaplain, purple MOhawked Mohican, and the pot bellied Chief, who is right on the edge thanks to the Mayor always yelling at him about the Tank Police antics.  Seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them, they are not very well liked by the people.The villains are a cyborg named Buaku who is got a mysterious past that is connected with a project known as Green Peace, his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks Anna  Uni Puma.  In the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who have not been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the 2nd they are hired to steal a painting that is of a naked Buaku.  The story, however, was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic Manga book that is very hard to find.All sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred.  This is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it, you would better go get Quentin Tarantino.  Uneven in places but still a lot of fun.Followed by New Dominion Tank Police.",

		"Fact Stargate SG1 is a cheesy scifi TV series.There is no escaping facts.  How much you try to excuse yourself or explain it Stargate SG1 remains a cheesy scifi TV series.Stargate SG1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly.  Special FX are not nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action is not going to blow you out of the chair.  I think cheesy scifi I follow perhaps one or two TV series at most and I hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when I found myself caught.So for those who decide to brush of Stargate SG1 as yet another tacky scifi show, do not.  Stick with it and you will see what I am talking about.",

I found tacky scifi I hold tacky scifi I follow tacky scifi Stick with it and you will see what I am talking about.",
		"Scott Bartletts OffOn is nine minutes of pure craziness.  It is avantegarde cinema There is no story to speak of, but Bartlett uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions, integrating these biological phenomena into the highlyindustrial form of modern technology.  In a sense, the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools, his machinery, his technology.  This theme connects loosely with the subplot of HAL9000 in Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968, and, indeed, Bartletts opening sequence of images  flashing colours before a closeup human eye  recalls Dave Bowmans journey through the Stargate.  The visuals are richlycoloured, a confronting blend of sharp, vivid photography and increasinglygrainy video, as though we are sitting too close to a television screen {as a matter of fact, the end product was recorded from a TV monitor}.There appears to be some confusion about the films release date.  IMDb lists the film as a 1972 release, but both the National Film Registry and the National Film Preservation Foundation give 1968 as the correct year.  Perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the films completion and its first public screening.  Either way, the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time, occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video, and some brisk techno music would not have gone amiss, either!  OffOn captures grainy, fragmented images, presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information.  I had a thought  and please do not laugh at this freethinking interpretation  that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing Earths television signals might very well receive such a disjointed, alien documentation of human life, a bizarre montage of only vaguelyfamiliar imagery that could not possibly make any coherent sense.  Perhaps this is where Mankind, with all his technology, is eventually heading, towards an irreversible merging of film and video, of purity and artificiality.",

Hugh OBrien plays the face, Buddy Hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to Lou Costello and thus, Abbott and Costello replacing the leads.  Do not know if that was true.all in all, a pleasant movie, but important to have that much Spike Jones and his band on film for history.  Wish that it was released, as I have not seen or heard of it now in two decades.  Hope it is not lost",

		"The performance by Om Puri, Smita Patil, and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely, along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by Govind Nihlani.  The dialogues by Vijay Tendulkar is also great.  I have not seen another movie like this.  It is one whole, each piece so nicely fit in the plot.  You cannot not be impressed by this movie.  Amrish Puri comes off as the bossy husband and baap of Om Puri.  Om Puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system.  Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain.  The first meeting of Anand Velankar with Rama Shettys at Sadhashivs place is absoulely stunning.  Smita Patil does not play a main role, but her part is also not distracting from the main plot.  And to add to this all Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings.  Saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble.  he gets other side He is other side Om Puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya.  A treat to all avid fans of Indian cinema.",

For Om Puri its first breakthrough in mainstream Hindi cinema  he delivered a class performance as Inspector Velankar.  Its more than cop character, he internalized a lot which is something original in acting.  Watch his scenes with his father whom he hates  Smita whom he loves.  Smita Patil maintained the dignity of her character to the expected level.  My God what a natural expressions she carried!!!  Shafi Inamdar was truly a discovery for me  he is a brilliant character actor if given a chance  here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even Om.  The movie is also a debut of a promising villain on Indian screen Sadashiv Amrapurkar as Rama Shetty.  he did loud villain It is loud villain Watch the scene where Om 1st time becomes a rebel for his father played by Amrish Puri  next both are sharing wine together.  How inner truth started revealing for both the character with confronting feelings of love  hate for each other.  Two faces of Indian Police Force Masculinity  Impotency and in between lies half truth ardh satyaKudos to Nihalanis touch.  The film won 2 National Awards as Best Hindi Feature Film  Best Actor Om Puri  3 Filmfare Awards in Best Film, Best Director  Best Supporting Actor Categories.  Recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious Hindi films.Ratings 810",
		"After Aakrosh , this was the second film for Govind Nihalani as a director.Till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in India.This movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence.  It was successful movies This movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood likeCOOLIE, BETAAB,HERO in 1983.SmithaPatel, in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him.  She was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs.At one time,she even gave up her love when the heros ruthlessness touched the roof top.There was another character in this movie, which was played by Om Puri contemporary, Naseeruddin Shah.He played as an inspectorturnedalcoholic character.The role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the heros ending.In his debut film,Sadashiv Amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare.The cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent.  The anger which left half handedly continued in Govind Nihalanis other film Drohkaal.  Even after two decades, this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew.  Each one played their part par excellence.",

		"An absolute classic !!  The direction is flawless , the acting is just superb.  Words fall great work The most definitive movie on Mumbai Police.  This movie has stood the test of times.Om Puri gives a stellar performance, Smita Patil no less.  All the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment.  This movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society.This is the story of a cop Om Puri  who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer.  The first attempt in Bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about Mumbai cops.  Kudos to Nihalani !!  After this movie a slew of Bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminalpoliticianpolice nexus.  Thus this movie was truly a trend setter.  This trend dominated the Hindi movie scene for more than a decade.  This movie was a moderate box office hit.  A mustsee for discerning movie fans.",
		"Govind Nihalanis directorial venture of Vijay Tendulkars novel is brilliant.  Om Puri plays an inspector Velankar who is forced to protect underworld don rama shetty, played brilliantly by sadahiv amrapurkar.  This is Govind Nihlans Most talked about movie.  This is a very good and a classic film.  Smita Patil plays the female lead opposite Om Puri.  Naseeruddin Shah is brilliant in a cameo role.  Although Sadashiv Amrapurkar has only 4 scenes in the movie he dominates the movie.  Puri won national award Filmfare award winner for Best Film,Story,Supporting ActorSadashiv Amrapurkar.",
		"I love this show! Every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is.  I am huge scifi I am important science show in the history of filmTV.  There are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion.  Its amazing, season after season the show gets better and better.I have been a fan of MacGyver since i was 5 19 now and i find it so ironic that my 2 favorite TV shows of all time star Richard Dean Anderson.  Its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other.Back when i first saw Stargate the movie, i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite scifi flicks, then hearing a TV show would spin from it i got really excited, but did not get showtime till the fifth season was almost over.Though, I am disappointed to hear that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio optioned the series instead.  Id say though that it turned out just fine.  Maybe even better.This show is amazing, and i hope it never dies.  Atlantis here we come!",

		"The Haunted World of Edward D.  Wood, Jr. is not a particularly good documentary.  Aesthetically, it is lackluster and cheap looking, the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and incohesive, but this adds to it is charm.  it is fellow oddballs it is other way I say other way There are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of Wood, and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary.  Overall, it is worth a watch for the Wood fan and those of cinema in general, but do not expect brilliance here.  Expect a documentary made after Woods own heart.",
		"I originally caught this back in 1996 in its one week run at a movie theatre.  I was infamous Edward Wood Jr. covering his life and movies.  There are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him.  They include Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco.  Interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations.  It is interesting somewhat but was this really needed?  I have seen all of Woods films and they are just terrible.  Wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out.  I would not say he was the worst director ever but he is down there.  Do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker?  I do like the fact that they did not try to make Wood out to be some sort of saint.  More than a few of those interviewed especially Lugosi Jr. pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear.  Also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s.  Still it is of interest if you are a Wood fan.  The best interviews are with Vampira who tears Wood apart and Dolores Fuller a long time girlfriend.",

		"I loved this film.  Not being a swooning Ed Wood Jr. fan, I prefer to appreciate his boundless enthusiasm and acknowledge his shortcomings.  His movies are fun, but his personal story is one racked with pain.  I hoped posthumous praise From beginning to end, this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology, leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to Ed Wood Jr.What we get are people who knew Ed Wood the best talking about him from all perspectives, positive and negative, and showing us their character as much as Eds.  We get insight into Eds personal and professional life from his romances, to his drinking, to his sexuality, to his friends, to his enemies, and even to his film making.The film itself is shot in a lowbudget way that seems done out of respect for Ed, as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the President.  The set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background.Fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding Ed Wood controversies, and new comers will be amazed that this man was real.  The DVD is full of impossible to find gems Crossroads of Lorado and photo galleries, but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story.Ed Wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him for better or worse, to the point where one woman will go down in history as Swimming Pool Owner for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool.  This ability to define a persons legacy comes through universally, as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was Ed Wood Jr., but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created.  Somehow, without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time, the connection that Ed Wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement.Even the title hints at the Blist horror genre, but by the end, we see that even this is a kindness.  What begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with Woods legend.In many ways a living contradiction, Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed to a single viewpoint.  This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get.  Being itself a juxtaposition of themes, it is at once respectful, provocative, thoughtful, gripping, fun, sad, kind, and fulfilling.",

		"The Haunted World of Edward D.  Wood, Jr. is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and, of course, Plan 9 from Outer Space.  This exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries, such as Look Back in Angora and The Plan 9 Companion, failed.  It rounds up his surviving entourage, many of whom have passed away since filming, and gives an honest examination of Ed Wood and his work.  it looks yesteryear Hollywood The entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together Eds life and untimely death for the viewer.

I had excellent Mary we have excellent Mary It takes excellent Mary It takes excellent Mary The cast also contains Bruno Lawrence, who is probably best remembered by American audiences from the film Smash Palace.  Terence Cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter Regan.  Sharply acted, with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads.  I first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in America, but believe you me, the unexpurgated version is not to be missed.",
		"I really like Miikes movies about Yakuza, this one I saw about 2 years ago and it really fued my head.  Never before seen such a sick and twisted thing.  The Story is good and the actors do their thing very well.  I believe German DVD I have German DVD I have German DVD If you have not seen the movie already and live in Germany maybe you better look out for a DVD from the Nederlands or Austria.  The ION DVD contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes, but at the showdown I felt that something was missing, about one or two very short scenes.All in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence, that is what I like Miike for!!",

		"Anyone new to the incredibly prolific Takashi Miikes work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director.  In keeping with Miikes working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script, this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller, with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with.  What takes the movie out of the realms of the sameold sameold however, is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in todays cinema.  And this is not that nice cool, clean violence so beloved of US cinema  this stuff is nasty, painful and HURTS!  That said, the pace is breakneck, the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities, Miikes sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments, and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be, making it hard to look away from the screen, whatever he might be showing you!  he ends new John",

		"The movie starts something like a less hyperkinetic, more pastiche Dead or Alive strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers.  it is flamboyant pieces Rather, it is a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction, as Tatsuhito digs his way through the underground, a maze that leads him to a gay Triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from Taiwan and keeps an almostbrothel of young boys one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning.  Tatsuhitos brother is getting involved with said society, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realm.What is mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship Tatsuhito has with his nemesis, Wang.  Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, later moved back into Japan, and alienated for it.  Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China, so killed his father and developed a crime wing in Japan.

And Tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he is forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother.

		"While not as wild and way out as some of Takashi Miikes later films this is a very good crime drama.  The basic story is the story of a cop of Japanese cop with Chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming Chinese mobster.  Complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang.  The film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust.  you do frantic pace.A There are also semigraphic depictions of gay sex.

		"I found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while I tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why.  One of the problems is the culturallanguage one.  we are English subtitles Another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences.  Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad Miiki film and this certainly is not that.  Plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence, a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect.  All in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one.",

		"Shinjuku Triad Society Chinese Mafia Wars is unlikely to get distribution in the West outside film festivals.  Why?  Could your censors stomach a film where policemen anally rape male and female suspects to get them to talk and the victims enjoy it or see an old lady have her eye torn out of her skull?  These are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent cops and gangsters story.  It makes Clockwork Orange which was banned for years in the UK look like a Disney cartoon.Should you see this film?  YES It is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of Asian cinema.  The shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters.  If you like this make sure you catch Dead or Alive which is very similar barring the insane ending in DOA of course.  they have same time The best chance of seeing this film outside a Takashi Miike retrospective at a film festival is on DVD.

		"it tries uberconventional realm It is a yakuzatriad picture, involving cops versus Japanese or Chinese gangsters mostly Chinese, as the title suggests, but already even in his first technical debut, Takashi Miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from hereon in.  Social issues like black market trading of precious goods, in this case human organs usually from children; nostalgia for childhood and ones roots, which was especially prevalent in Dead or Alive 2; thumbingofthenose at taboos like gay sex and satirical rapeviolence towards women; bloodcurdling violence.  It is certainly not as surreal as some of Miikes most recent films, but this is expected as he is trying out things that he is just starting to learn, following a track record of straight to video programmers.  It is got all of those qualities, and it is also, like the films that would follow from it, equally savage and heartfelt, crazy in spots and sardonic in its drama, and solid for genre fans.The story concerns two brothers, one a Chinese orphan raised in Japan, Tatsuhito Kiriya Kippei Shiina, pretty decent as a Eastwoodesquire antiherohero, who is become a detective, and another, who is become a gangster, or a wouldbe one.  The main arch likely takeover gang comes from Wang a definite pun on what the gang represents during its sparetime, played by Tomorowo Taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes, and his partner Karino Takeshi Caesar, who is threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who is just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal, who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a Miike movie.  There is some intrigue involving the organtrading scheme with the gangsters, which Kiriya almost becomes a victim of, and the gangs penchant for gay sex at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want.  It all leads up to vengeance and redemption, qualities that Miike and his writer are trying to emulate from Shakespeare hence the Macbeth bit with Wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying it will not come off.If it does not add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great Shakespeare play would have, it is par for the course of a film like this.

		"This movie is the first of Miikes triad society trilogy, and the trilogy kicks of to a great start.  The movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically, and these themes are actually apparent in all his films, if you look close enough.  Shinjuku Triad Society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders, struggling their way to the top of Tokyos yakuza.  The kid brother is a lawyer, and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one, as the movie progresses.  The movie takes place in a very harsh environment, and is therefore pretty violent and tough.  Miike has serious movie As usual there is also a lot of perverted sex, mostly homosexual in this one.  The movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie, but with a great drive and true grittiness.  If you have only seen Miikes farout movies Ichi the killer, Fudoh etc. this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive overthetop style displayed in those movies and his more serious side, as seen in the other films of the trilogy.  And as always with Miike, there are at least two scenes in this that you will NEVER forget see it and figure out which ones for yourself.810",

		"A lot has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true Miike film and I thought this sort of description might have been a clich?.  But, like all clich?s, it is based on the truth.  All the Miike trademarks are here, the violence, the black humour, the homosexuality, the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character.  Shinjuku is however, one of Miikes most perfectly formed films.  He says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different, but not necessarily better.  he means raw edge I think raw edge As you might expect, the violence is utterly visceral, gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face.  Only a Miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that.  The film has a fantastic pace, unlike Dead or Alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle.  Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues, Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here, the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past.  I cannot sing Shinjukus praises enough.  I do not want to give away too much.  This is Miike before he began to use CGI to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitanos Sonatine.  The central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you will be popping it back on again to work it all out.",

We are Central Perk Even from this first episode we get a sign of the RossRachel relationship that will come over the next ten years, when Ross says I just want to be married again and Rachel storms in with a wedding dress on... probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a MonicaJoey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back.  Something else.. in this episode Rachel is introduced to Chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes, the socalled flashbacks this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions.  Nevertheless, the point is this a fine start to a great show.  This episode may not be the usual Friends as we are accustomed to them, with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was!  Keep watching, first season is a blast!!",

Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry I am doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb, and for Lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as Pheobe Pheebs and Matthew Perry is just Matthew Perry playing himself basically!  The episode quality does improve later,,, such as the Sets, they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly, the acting is OK, the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot!

Through the first two episodes, we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her, and there is Tealc, a quiet, compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team.  The main bad guys are called the Gouald, they are parasites who can get inserted into ones brain, thus controlling them and doing evil deeds.  Any Gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a System Lord.  The warriors behind the Gouald are called Jaffa, who house the parasitic Gouald in their bodies until the Gouald can get inserted in a persons brain.Through the episodes, we mostly get to see SG1, the exploratory team comprised of JackDanielTealcand Sam, go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets this device is called the Stargate and they encounter new cultures or bad guys.  Some episodes are onworld, meaning that they do not go through the Stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on Earth.Through the years, you start to see a decline in the SG1 team as close knit, and more characterbuilding story lines.  This, in turn means even more onworld episodes, which is perfectly understandable.My rating 8.7510While most of this show is good, there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years.

This, in turn means even more onworld episodes, which is perfectly understandable.My rating 8.7510While most of this show is good, there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years.  But still, top notch science fiction!",
		"Stargate SG1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie Stargate.  I am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject.  The show gets it rolling from the very first episode, a retired Jack ONeill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion, Dr.  Daniel Jackson.  Through the first two episodes, we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her, and there is Tealc, a quiet, compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team.  The main bad guys are called the Gouald, they are parasites who can get inserted into ones brain, thus controlling them and doing evil deeds.  Any Gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a System Lord.  they encounter new cultures Some episodes are onworld, meaning that they do not go through the Stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on Earth.Through the years, you start to see a decline in the SG1 team as close knit, and more characterbuilding story lines.

		"The pilot is extremely well done.  It lays future episodes I do not think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show.  It displays remarkable creativity on the writers part.  Although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode, a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot.  An example would be Ross and Rachels future relationship.  Even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared, it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice.Bravo.A great start to an unbeatable comedy!",

		"Why did it sound like the husband kept calling her Appy ?  It ruined great episode It ruined great episode Proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film.It was very Hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though I dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die.  The more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining.I do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre. 610 come on Yankies get your English up to par !",

		"I am sure Rob he made second season fact is second season I am second season There was a similar underdog story in season one, when William Malone made on of the best episodes with The Fair Haired Child even though his other long feature films Fear Dot Com and House on Haunted Hill sucked pretty badly.The story of Right to Die cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia, but thankfully also features multiple oldfashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance, murderous conspiracies, pitch black humor and comic book styled violence.  Whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husbands continuous adultery, the Addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident.  Cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife Abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially.  Whilst Cliff and his sleazy attorney Corbin Bernsen of The Dentist want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor, Abbeys mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on Cliff.  Meanwhile Abbeys hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in Cliffs surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices.  After a few victims, Cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well.  Right to Die is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff I always hoped to see from a TVseries concept like Masters of Horror.  It is violent and gory with a sick  twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences.  The euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well, yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons.  The atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling.  Actresses Julia Anderson and Robin Sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks, which is always a welcome plus, and Corbin Bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a meanspirited and egocentric bastard.

		"A man and his wife get in a horrible car accident.  When the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state, the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live.  The decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him.This comes to us from director Rob Schmidt, who made Wrong Turn a film I have not seen.  With only one horror film under his belt, and not a particularly notorious one at that, I was a bit reluctant to watch this episode, expecting Schmidt to be a Master of Horror in only the most liberal sense.  My apologies to him for my underestimation.  As of episode 10 in a 13 episode season, this was actually the best one yet.The issue of the right to die is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device.  However, this is only the foundation on which the story revolves.  Once the horror elements show up, the film goes from decent to spectacular.  Great acting great plot I was a little creeped out at times which is good and most of all the gore is in extreme abundance!  I read a review of this episode prior to watching it, where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of Hellraiser in this.  Through the first part of the show, I had no idea what they were talking about.  Then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of Hellraiser 2.  However, I in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film.  I can see no other way to create the effect that was created, and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than Hellraiser 2.Some plot twists show up later on, and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look.  I did not watch it a second time, but I think the beginning would make more sense if I had not that it is confusing.  The subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice, and I found myself going back and forth about whether I disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if I felt bad for him.

		"A man and his wife get in a horrible car accident.  When the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state, the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live.  The decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him.This comes to us from director Rob Schmidt, who made Wrong Turn a film I have not seen.  With only one horror film under his belt, and not a particularly notorious one at that, I was a bit reluctant to watch this episode, expecting Schmidt to be a Master of Horror in only the most liberal sense.  My apologies to him for my underestimation.  As of episode 10 in a 13 episode season, this was actually the best one yet.The issue of the right to die is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device.  However, this is only the foundation on which the story revolves.  Once the horror elements show up, the film goes from decent to spectacular.  Great acting, great plot, great dialogue, great suspense.  I was extreme abundance I read a review of this episode prior to watching it, where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of Hellraiser in this.  Through the first part of the show, I had no idea what they were talking about.  Then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of Hellraiser 2.  However, I in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film.  I can see no other way to create the effect that was created, and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than Hellraiser 2.Some plot twists show up later on, and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look.  I did not watch it a second time, but I think the beginning would make more sense if I had not that it is confusing.

		"Stargate SG1 follows and expands upon the Egyptian mythologies presented in Stargate.  In the Stargate universe, humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the Goauld such as Ra and Apophis.  For millennia, the Goauld harvested humanity, heavily influencing and spreading human cultures.  As a result, Earth cultures such as those of the Aztecs, Mayans, Britons, the Norse, Mongols, Greeks, and Romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy.  Many wellknown mythical locations such as Avalon, Camelot, and Atlantis are found, or have at one time existed.Presently, the Earth stargate found at a dig site near Giza in 1928 is housed in a topsecret U.S. military base known as the SGC Stargate Command underneath Cheyenne Mountain.  Col.  Jack ONeill Anderson, Dr.  Daniel Jackson Shanks, Capt.  andor leave later seasons Along with 24 other SG teams, they venture to distant planets exploring the galaxy and searching for defenses from the Goauld, in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races.The parasitic Goauld use advanced technology to cast themselves as Egyptian Gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship.  Throughout the first eight seasons, the Goauld are the primary antagonists.  They are a race of highly intelligent, ruthless snakelike alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species, including humans.  The original archenemy from this race was the System Lord Apophis Peter Williams.  Other System Lords, such as Baal and Anubis, play pivotal roles in the later seasons.  In the ninth season a new villain emerges, the Ori.  The Ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy, also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship.  The introduction of the Ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on Egyptian mythology into an exploration of the Arthurian mythology surrounding the Ori, their followers, and their enemiesthe Ancients.",

		"Fans of the HBO series Tales From the Crypt are going to love this MOH episode.  HER is good looks He could play a really nice if misunderstood guynextdoor, or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness.  In the case of RIGHT TO DIE, he takes the latter approach, and it definitely works.Donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist Robin Sydney, much to the displeasure of his inconsolable, unforgiving spouse, Abbey Julia Anderson.  When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of making up, and she is horribly burned in a fire, he is reluctant to pull the plug on her, not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy Corbin Bernsen, looking the worse for wear these days.  But Abbeys never been one to give up without a fight, and that is where the ECtheme of the episode comes in.  Cuckolded husbands  and wives  have always been the genres favorite subject matter for some spooky and OOKY supernatural shenanigans, and this case is definitely no exception.  If anything, the rampedup quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere.And that is not to mention that John Espositos original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist.  You do not realize as you are watching that you only know half the story, until close to the end...think WHAT LIES BENEATH with more guts and gazongas, and you are there.Not a bad effort, but not the best of the lot, either.  At least Rob Schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction, especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed!  As with most MOH episodes, this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment, so the extremely squeamish need not apply.",

Not only did I find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the screwee, I felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself.  Some parts are very reminiscant of Hellraiser, but come off as tribute rather than imitation.  It is a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider, but I enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile.  This piece brings it and does not appologize.

		"This was a superb episode, one of the best of both seasons.  Down right horror for a change, with a story that is way way above the average MOH episodes, if there is such a thing.  A mans wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck, in which he was driving.  His airbag worked, hers did not.  She is great makeup She is full skin BUT, even in a coma, she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology, and when she does die for a few minutes, her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit.  Carnage of course ensues, and also some extremely gory killings, and also, some extremely sexy scenes.  What more could you ask for, you might ask?  Well, not much, because this baby has it all, and a very satirical ending, that should leave a smile on most viewers faces.  I just loved Rob Schmidts Wrong Turn direction too, he has a great knack for horror.  Excellent episode, this is one I am buying for sure.",

For those that panned it for being predictable  If you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing... then you want a thriller.

Fi you want to watch a movie that does not demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it.  The acting is good, and I really liked Michael Rispoli.  He was in Rounders, too.  And While You Were Sleeping.  The rest of the cast is fun.  they are own weddings It is own weddings I know... sounds kooky... but it is.  And that is what makes it fun to watch.

		"Does anyone know the exact quote about time and love by George Ede aka, Father Fitzpatrick in the move, It had to be you?  He was talking to Charlie and Annna in the church as they were leaving?  If not I will have to rent the movie.  This was a great movie.  I also loved Serendipity!  Great love story for the soul!  I met emotional relationship Altho, we did marry, I was not mature enough to give as much as I thought I would.  I got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for 7 years.  He finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry  in disbelief about the way it turned out.  I had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 years.This movie meant a lot because I am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love.  I can NOW appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of Father Fitzpatrick rang true for me.I know when he has healed enough to trust me again, we will remarry.Do not EVER GET COMPLACENT AND TAKE TRUE LOVE FOR GRANTED!  IT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST LESSON OF MY LIFE.  Also the music in this movie is OUTSTANDING and MEANINGFUL!  This movie is DEEP and spiritually uplifting.  TRUE LOVE is worth waiting for, if it is meant to be, it will, no matter what, IT WILL HAPPEN!  Nothing is impossible, even when it is the second time around!  Thanks!",

		"I would have given this film a few stars, simply because it was a Lifetime presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story  here, New York City.  Most on this channel, whether set there, in rural Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, L.A. etc., are filmed in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or some other Canadian locale.But if there ever were one deserving the top rating  10 on this site, it is this movie.  Certainly not for originality, for this story has been done many times, in many variations, with several very similar to this specific one.  It is big screen I can think of at least 1012 more, just as prominent, past to present, off the top of my head, who could be added now, and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind.Not to drone on, but my point is that, in my opinion, this is by far one of the best of this genre I have seen.  I caught it by chance on a midday Friday, at a time when I had the TV on only because I was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week.  I would never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made.  And, while the two leads have done enough to be known to most, they were completely unknown to me.  The only two actors I knew were Phyllis Newman Annas mother whom I would seen in some things from her younger days, and Michael Rispoli Henry, Charlies best friend who was outstanding as Gramma, the menacing juice loan, tough, street guy from Rounders.  The chance meeting and coupling between both leads best friends, as a substory romance, with the correlation of their being such to Anna and Charlie being only revealed to all later, is an oftdone plot contrivance within the genre, but makes no difference to the enjoyment here in fact, it enhances it.Checking some other comments, I agree completely with those which are the most positive.  The primary word describing this film is ENGAGING, in caps.  This adjective describes the performers; the characters; the chemistry between and among all of the characters, in whatever combination presented, and all of the supporting and even minor roles.I love films with a harder edge Rounders; the escapist SchwarzeneggerStallone fare; Goodfellows; even the classics like Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane.  But for pure, uncomplicated enjoyment, this one was outstanding.  With a bare fraction of their budgets, it was equal to the results achieved by You have Got Mail and Sleepless in Seattle.  And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan could not have done better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan here; the costars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these megafilms, as well.",

		"A sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings.  they are other people Maybe a little trite in that the partners are both type A personalities, while our protagonists are much more relaxed.  Not anything heavy, but it made me smile.  And hey for the guys  sell the Natasha Henstridge angle, and the gals  sell them the sappy romance, everyone wins!",
		"It is whole franchise Stargate; SG1 is, without a doubt, a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shouldertoshoulder with Star Trek as the kings of scifi.Following on from the 1994 feature film Stargate, this series sees Stargate command a militaryscience organisation figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore.  SG1 is one such team, headed by military veteran Colonel Jack ONeill, and includes archaeologist Doctor Daniel Jackson, military scientist Captain Samantha Carter and alien Tealc, who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people.  Earth quickly makes an enemy of the Goauld, a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods.The topnotch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life.  Richard Dean Anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic ONeill, who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye.  Michael Shanks, as Daniel, brings heart and an will of steel to the character, who has grown from wideeyed innocence to darker and more hardbitten as the show has progressed.  Amanda Tapping, as Carter, has perfected the balance between depicting her characters femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong, intelligent military scientist.  Christopher Judge is excellent as the aloof Tealc, who is able to depict the characters emotions with subtlety.  And Don S Davis is perfect as the esteemed General Hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness.Almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence, reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs often shown through arguments between ONeill and Jackson.  Guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that does not bore viewers.  SG1 also excels in humour, from ONeills wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd!  SG1 has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death.  It is not just an excellent scifi show but is an excellent show, overall.",

		"Sure, this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clich?s, but it is entertaining, and that is what I watch movies for.  To be entertained.  Natasha Henstridge is stunning, even with the short hair.  Her smile is radiant and her beauty cannot be disguised.  As for Michael Vartan, I am sure the women love him.  The two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film.  I do not understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them.  I guess British accent To tell you the truth I had not really noticed it until I read these comments, but I went back to the DVD and now her dialogue sounds more British than American to me, but she was ideal for her role with that one exception.  It is a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others, but who find their soul mates in one another.  It may be an unlikely story, but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries?  It is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube.  That is why we watch them, to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen.  I thought these actors did a good job of it, but hey, I am a sentimental guy who tears up easily.  Do not get me wrong though, it has to be a sentimental scene, and this movie had plenty of those.I give it 910 only because I am saving my 1010 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that I know will come along some day.  If you see it advertised as coming up on the Movie Channel or Lifetime Movies, or whatever, make a note to watch it.  I think you will like it.",

I guess we see what we want to see.Olivia dAbo and Michael Rigoli were fun to watch, even if dAbos British accent did creep into her supposed Bronx speech.  To tell you the truth I had not really noticed it until I read these comments, but I went back to the DVD and now her dialogue sounds more British than American to me, but she was ideal for her role with that one exception.  It is a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others, but who find their soul mates in one another.  It may be an unlikely story, but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries?  It is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube.  That is why we watch them, to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen.  I thought these actors did a good job of it, but hey, I am a sentimental guy who tears up easily.  it has sentimental scene it has sentimental scene I am magnificent movie If you see it advertised as coming up on the Movie Channel or Lifetime Movies, or whatever, make a note to watch it.  I think you will like it.",
		"A beautiful postcard of New York.  The thing I enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear.  It never did.  My teenagers liked it too.  My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan.  My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and ALL enjoy something.  This film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done.  The ending came with a twist which we all liked too.  you are cynical person As a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did.  I recommend it and we need more of these films to watch.",

		"I have looked forward to seeing this since I first saw it listed in her work.  it being funny story Writers probably should not get a bonus, everyone else SRO for making the movie.Anybody who appreciates a romantic Movie SHOULD SEE IT.Natashas screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric, to say nothing of her beauty, that anything she is in goes on my favorite list.  Her TV and print interviews that I have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for.God Bless her, her family and future endeavors.This movie does not seem to available in DVD or video yet, but I would be the first to buy it and I think others would too.",
		"I caught this film at a test screening.  Was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story.  Well acted.  Natasha Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts.  The male lead was awsome.  Very funny film.  Takes place in the best locations in New York.  Made me want to go there.  I just saw You have got mail I thought It Had To Be You was a much better story.  Fresher.It was whole family I think it will do well.  Audience I saw it with loved it.  A definite recommend!",
		"seeni have differentsweet role Some of the negative comments i read are true,the movie is full of clich?s and the story does not ring true at all.Also,even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together,i do not think there is screen chemistry there.  However,i enjoyed this movie.The locales are nice,the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good.  If you are expecting to see a great romance,this is not it.But if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good.",
		"This is the first Michael Vartan movie i have seeni have not seen Alias and i was curious to see if the guy can act.He sure can and is likable in this movie.Natasha Henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles,so i found her very good and lovable in this differentsweet role of a schoolteacher.

		"I just cannot understand the negative comments about this film.  it is such flair Henstridge talk about winning the genepool lottery!  is as magnetic and alluring as ever who says the golden age of cinema is dead?  and Vartan holds his own.There is simmering chemistry between the two leads; the film is most alive when they share a scene  lots!  It is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together...Ignore the negative comments  if you are feeling a bit blue, watch this flick, you will feel so much better.

		"Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories.  you get real feel Cashs narration is good too.But....1.  The actor who played Jesus was miscast. 2.  There is no edge to the story like Cash puts in some of his faith based music. 3.  Because it is uncompelling, I doubt we will see this ever widely distributed again.I would love to buy the CD.Tom Paine Texas, USA",

		"I went brated movie I came out surprised and very amused.  Eva was good, but Lake Bell stole the show.  She had amazing comedic timing.  The jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between.  The plot was enough to tie it all together, a woman Eva dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her wastobe husband, its sounds farfetched but it actually works quite well. 710  Overall its a worthwhile cinema watch, if not get it on DVD when it comes out.",

		"I took a flyer in renting this movie but I gotta say, it was very, very good.  On all fronts script, cast, director, photography, and high production values, etc.  Proves Eva Longoria Parker is head and shoulders in romcom above bad actors such as Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston, who mug and call it acting.  Whoda thunk it? Parker and Isla Fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as Over Her Dead Body.  Lake Bell is excellent, too, and this is the first time I have seen her.  And finally, Paul Rudd gets to shine in a really good movie, instead of lesser films.A movie like this never gets its dues from closeminded males.  It is too bad.  As other IMDb reviewers here have noted, there is nothing lame about this gem no hack writing or acting.  And its depiction of contemporary L.A. and California, in general, makes every scene look bright, beautiful, clean, and otherwise outstanding in every way.  Never before has a movie made L.A. look so good.  Ah, what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie.I will not divulge the plot, but as a longtime and hardcore atheist, I was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and lighthearted piece of entertainment.  movie exposes sentimental crap It reminds enjoyable.This movie We already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre.  Some of us save our praise for the truly worthy, however.If you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as Into the Night with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, Blind Date with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, American Dreamer with JoBeth Williams, Chances Are with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard, Making Mr.  Right with John Malkovich, etc., you will enjoy this.  A firstrate job all around even if it is kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years.

I think it is a shame it only scored 5.2 in rating.  Too many guys voting?  It was romantic comedies Just because I am female I do not enjoy all chic flicks, on the contrary I prefer other genres.  Romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be.  But like I said, this movie had it all, almost, in my opinion.  Great script, good oneliners, fine acting.

		"Once when I was in college and we had an international fair, the Russian section had a Sovietera poster saying Ne boltay! , meaning Do not gossip!.  I translated it for the generation of TV watchers as Do not be Gladys Kravitz!  in reference to the nosy neighbor on Bewitched.However, when you see the result of gossip in the Pvt.  it is laughing matter In this case, the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the Axis Powers have attacked the United States.  So, he tells it to someone, who tells someone else, who tells someone else, and it continues.  As in The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming, the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time, so that when it gets back to Snafu...well, you know what I mean!  Yes, it is mostly WWII propaganda  complete with a derogatory term for the Japanese  but I have to say that the Pvt.  Snafu shorts were actually quite funny.  Of course, since they had Dr.  Seuss writing and Mel Blanc providing the voices, it is no surprise that these came out rather cool.  Worth seeing.",

When Snafu starts a rumour about a bombing, it escalates into an eventual rumour that America has lost the war.

		"RUMORS is instructional cartoons The films were aimed at servicemen and were directed, animated and scored by some of the top talent from Warner Bros.  Termite Terrace, including Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones, and Carl Stalling.  The invaluable Mel Blanc supplied the voice for Snafu, and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by Theodor Geisel, i.e.  Dr.  Seuss.  The idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery, using the character of Snafu as a perfect negative example he was the dope, the little twerp who would do everything you are NOT supposed to do.  According to Chuck Jones the scripts had to be approved by Pentagon officials, but Army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes, certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow all for the greater good, of course.As the title would indicate, this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors.  The setting is an Army camp.  Private Snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine something you will not see in any other Hollywood films of the era and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling.  We observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted, then exaggerated, then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp.  The imagery is indeed vivid the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot, while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air, i.e balloon juice.  A soldier shoots his mouth off, cannonstyle, and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction.  Winged baloney, at that.  Panicked soldiers tell each other that the Brooklyn Bridge has been pulverized, Coney Island wiped out, enemy troops have landed on the White House lawn, and the Japanese are in California.  The visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for Rumoritis and Private Snafu has been locked up in a padded cell.This is a highly effective piece of work.  The filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy, and the message is still a valid one.  In recent years we have seen that catastrophic events real or imagined can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances.  Because the technology has improved, the Private Snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via email, cellphones and blogging.  Consequently, RUMORS is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message does not feel at all dated; in fact it may be more timely than ever.",

		"This was another World War II message to the soldiers and to the Allies to be careful about spreading rumors.  it was main character Snafu.All of us have imaginations, along with fears and whathaveyou, and that is what happens here as Pvt.

		"Though structured totally different from the book by Tim Krabb? who wrote the original The Vanishing Spoorloos it does have the same overall feel, except for that Koolhovens style is less businesslike and more lyric.  The beginning is great, the middle is fine, but the sting is in the end.  A surprise emotional ending.  As you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film, but it is done all very beautifully.  Never explicit, but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour.  It is American films Where Dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject, De Grot stays always within the boundaries of good taste.  De Grot tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years.  When you will leave the cinema you will be moved.  What can we ask more of a film?  Anyway, this film even gives more....",
		"Tim Krabbe is the praised author of Het Gouden Ei, a novel that was put on the screen twice Spoorloos and The Vanishing.  One of the Dutch writers more recent works is De Grot, a psychological thriller about two totally different men, Egon and Axel, who meet at a youth camp and, surprising enough, become friends for dear life.  Egon is dull person Axel, on the other hand, is a charismatic partyanimal, a heavy drinking criminal whose everydays concern is to get a woman into his bedroom.  From the moment they meet, Axel has a strong influence on Egon, while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything such as reading thick books like Egon; ultimately, Egon is even dragged by Egon into illegal practices himself, which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant Asian country.After having read the book last year, I was surprised the critics were quite positive about it.  In my opinion, the book suffers especially from the complex structure.  While Krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people, the plot becomes more of a puzzle the many episodes are not presented chronologically, so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode.  Because of this, the story feels surprisingly remote you often need to know a characters background to really care for him or her.  Another complaint was the fact that the main characters, Egon and Axel, are a little stereotypical.  Egon IS the dull intellectual, while Axel IS his exact opposite.  In real life, such onedimensional people rarely exist; in books and films, they always seem to be there, taking away a lot of credibility.Despite all this, the film was a pleasant surprise, being much better than the book.  The adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography, humour and acting Fedja van Huet Egon is one of the few Dutch actors who can make you forget he IS acting which is, in my opinion, the highest an actor can achieve.  The drawbacks of the film, however, are the same as the books mainly because the characters are onedimensional, they are so predictable that it becomes annoying.  Guess who wrote the script?  Indeed, Krabbe himself.  It is obvious that this talented director that is what the movie makes clear anyway is hampered by a deficient screenplay.  Perhaps Koolhoven should just have chosen a better book.710",

		"De Grot is a terrific Dutch thriller, based on the book written by Tim Krabb?.  Another of his books, Het Gouden Ei was made into the great Dutch mystery thriller called Spoorloos The Vanishing in 1988.  This one is not as good as that thriller although much better than the American remake also called The Vanishing but there are times it comes close.Especially the opening moments are terrific.  We see a man, later we learn his name is Egon Wagter Fedja van Hu?t, coming from a plane in Thailand.  When he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border.  These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted.  A kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this.  Later we see how Egon makes his deal in Thailand with a woman, both stating that they have never done anything like this.From this point the movie is constantly flashback and flashforward.  We see how Egon, still as a child here played by Erik van der Horst, befriends a guy named Axel as a kid played by Benja Bruijning.  We learn how they grew up as friends, sort of, and how Axel as an adult played by Marcel Hensema became a criminal.  Egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman.  Around this time he sometimes meets Axel but does not really want anything to do with him.The movie is chronological in a way.  It shows young adults But from time to time, like I said, the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again.  Every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults.Minor spoilers herein.The title means The Cave, and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending, although it is in fact not that happy.  Like the beginning, the ending is terrific.  The middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes, only to come back at that point in the end.  It is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending, although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well.",

		"De Grot is a very good film.  The great plot comes from the novel by Tim Krabb?, who also adapted this story for the screen.  Some really topclass acting, not only by Van Hu?t, but especially by Marcel Hensema, who mostly did TVwork prior to his performance of Axel van de Graaf.  The film seems to kick of as a thriller, and sets an excellent mood.  Then we start to learn about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flashback structure, which adds to the more romantic aspect and the characterdriven drama of the movie.  In the end this all culminates into an emotional ending, that will grab audiences by their throats.  Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie.  you liked original screen",

		"Indian Directors have it tough, They have to compete with movies like Laggan where 11 henpecked,Castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots.  they live red tapestry characters running red tapestry But to make a good movie, you have to tightrope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with Split skirts and DishumDishum fights preferably involving a nitwit Bollywood leading actor who is marginally handsome.  So you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of Leonine village head who in own words defending his Village this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience.  There are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like Nana Patekar Narasimhan.  Nana Patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the Politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him, meanwhile his daughter is bathing his Grandson.This is as authentic a scene you can get in rural India.  Nana Patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in Hindi Films.  The violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with SongDances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies will not sell, a sad but true state of affairs.  Faster this changes better for Bollywood.  All said and done this is one good Movie.",

The story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag, especially when Shahrukh comes in the picture.  What really made me like it were the performances of the leads, the dialog delivery, as well as the story, for what it was.  It could have been directed better, and edited.  The supporting case was even great, including Karimas mother in law, even though she just had one shining moment, it was great to watch her.The sets were also pretty good.

A story about a womans fight against harsh injustice.The story of the film revolves around Nandini Karisma Kapoor who lives in Canada with her two uncles Tiku Talsania, Jaspal Bhatti.  There she meets Shekhar Sanjay Kapoor, falls in love with him and they soon marry.  Their family is complete when Nandini has a boy, Raja Master Jai Gidwani.  them leave perfect life And that is when the problems start.  From the moment they reachIndia, both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere.  They take a crowded train to reach Shekhars village and when they finally reach the station, they have to catch a long bus drive to his village.  The filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a neverending drive.  And unfortunately for them, a frenzied mob that beat Shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus.  Fortunately, they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him.  After that, they drive to the handing Havel where Shekhars father, Narsimha Nana Patekar lives with his wife Deepti Naval.  Nandani realized that her fatherinlaw is in command as soon as she enters the place, but her only solace is her motherinlaws warm welcome.Living there, Nandini learns of her fatherinlaws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him.  The day she sees her fatherinlaw teach her son to throw a bomb, she loses it and lashes out against him, insisting to Shekhar that they move back to Canada.  But terror strikes again when Shekhar is murdered one day, leaving a broken down Nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel fatherinlaw.  Her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heartwrenching film.What sets apart Shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie.  The only drawback is Ismail Darbars music, which fails to rise above the script.  The only saving grace is the sexy item number Ishq Kameena, which has been composed by Anu Malik.  Another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast.  Karisma Kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother.  She is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal.  Second is actor Nana Patekar who is back with a bang with this film.  His uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he is shown his versatility once again with this role.  Sanjay Kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors.  Deepti Naval too is in top form and her Prclimax showdown with Nana is praiseworthy.  Shahrukhs cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he is been pulled in to get the required star value.  Though his role was not really required, he is done it well.  Overall, Shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the Prrelease hype is sure to get it a good opening.  Shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up.  So what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least 2 reels to better the impact.  Shakti still has the power to go on without a hitch!",

		"I have long time However, I am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film, because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied.  This picture has everything any movie could ever have.  It has characteristics of a romantic comedy, a political commentary, a thriller, a drama, an action movie, a musical, and an absurdist selfconscious art film.  It is all in there, adding up to a myth.The basic premise is about an Indian couple, Nandini Karishma Kapoor and Shekhar Sanjay Kapoor, happily living in Canada, who rush to India to visit the husbands parents after a disturbing news report.  The rest of the story takes place in India, where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence.  At one point, the story borrows from Not without my baby, but to call Shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice.The ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions, including Shah Rukh Khans dream of Aishwarya Rai which comes as if out of another movie.  In fact, the two stars are on all the posters, but they appear really late in the film, and only Shah Rukh ends up being a real character.  Yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance.Karishma Kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film, and she does an admirable job, having to link up the films twists and turns with a show of believable emotion.  Another notable presence is Nana Patekar, who plays Narsimha, the tyrannical father of the husband Shekhar.  Nana Patekar dominates every scene he is in with a scary but nuanced character.The movie is not without its share of realism.  Violence is rampant, but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters, with Karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions.  At times, this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic.I have seen a share of Bollywood releases, and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm.  But Shakti raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous.  It is a film that achieves the grandeur of a Shakespearian tragedy, where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained.  It is pure, gratuitous cinema, and the director Krishna Vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book.  Perhaps, the allimportant message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind, but I came out of watching Shakti exhilarated.  Making movies can be the most fun in the world!",

		"The beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mothers love, the exceptional performances, the steady execution and the quite innovative script.  The film tells the story of an Indian woman, Nandini, who lives in Canada with her husband Shekhar and little kid Raja.  All of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in India of whom she had not even known is in troubles and the couple rush to India.  When they get into the village, Nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture; Shekhars family, ruled by his cruel, highly cynical and merciless father Narasimha, lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless.  Nandini starts nagging Shekhar Nandini starts nagging Shekhar When she wants to leave, Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India.  Here starts the intense struggle which can be called Nandini vs.  Narasimha.India is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film, but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas, so it may be even correct.  The portrayal is in my view fair and not onesided because the positive side is also presented to an extent.  Such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world.  The locations are amazing, the music is wonderful, and Krishna Vamshis direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing.  One thing that must be noted is the very earpleasing background score by Ismail Darbar, it is beautiful.  The characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film.  Portrayed realistically throughout, the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch.  Its dialogues are superb and intelligently written, and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points, a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension.The films biggest strength is the performances.  Karisma Kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as Nandini.  Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible.  She displays so much intensity, impulsiveness, anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son.  Her outbreaks while facing off Nana Patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child.  After Fiza, this is her most powerful performance.  One of the greatest actors Indian cinema has seen, Nana Patekar is indescribable as Narasimha.  He manages to be hateful as Narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him.  Patekar displays cruelty, wittiness and even humanity with total conviction.  He is outstanding.  Another great performance comes unsurprisingly from Indias most underrated actress, Deepti Naval, who sensitises her character to perfection.  Sanjay Kapoor is just adequate and Shahrukh Khan provides great comic relief.  Anyway, do watch Shakti  it could have been better, but it is definitely a mustwatch.",

		"If any movie stands out extremely with the actors acting skills, this is probably the one.  dialogues be rough way I have rough way I have strong feeling The movie was disturbing at moments.  However, the movie was terrible at editing.  The movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs, yet they feel out of place.  Like Karisma is getting beat up, and the same time SRK is fighting comically with the police officers.  The Ishq Kamina song was very out of place.  On top of that, the movie is overly glossy in the beginning.  The direction was not bad, but certainly nothing one can brag about.I have to say that the actors were chosen very wisely.  Without them, this movie would not have an impact.  Karisma Kapoor has given her best role to date, and this looks very good on her record after Zubeidaa and Fiza.  She looks pretty in the first half, and I have never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her.  What is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date.  Nana Patekar was excellent as her fatherinlaw.  Not much to say about him, besides this is a role made for him.  Deepti Naval as the motherinlaw was excellent especially in her final scene.  Though she does not have much to say, her facial expressions and body language was good.  The other good performance was the little kid.  He was adorable, and is sure to bring tears to the viewers eyes.  The movie was probably saved desperately by their performances.  Sanjay Kapoor was all right, but he did not have much to do.  Shahrukh Khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role.  One thing that brought the audience to the theater was Ishq Kamina.  The song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song.  And boy Aish is mad hot.  However, the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever.  People may have come to the movie for Aish, but they will not brag too much about it afterwards.  Hum Tum Miley was properly paced, but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie.  Damroo Bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about.  Dil Ne Pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie.  Despite the poor editing, the performances alone make it a must see.",

		"Uneven Bollywood drama.  they are terrorist warlords Drama and tragedy ensue, and the film becomes a kind of NOT WITHOUT MY BABY styled thriller.  Film is compelling, its few songdance numbers are uninteresting and needless, the gaity of Bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this films drama, at least once we have left the comforting confines of their Canadian love nest  although one number involving a cameo by the stunning Aishwarya Rai is enjoyably provocative, if ultimately misplaced as well.  Likewise, the inclusion of Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan as a happygolucky drifter who helps Kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce, and it only gets back on his feet when his character  and his fantasies about Rai that generate her cameo dance  are dispensed with.  His throwaway comicbook dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the films primary gripping drama.  The cast is nicely supported by Nana Patekar as the warlord, and the elegant Deepti Naval who is outstanding as his longsuffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the films best scenes; Ritu Shivpuri and Rajshree Solanki are also very good as Sanjays sisters in India, and very pleasing eye candy.  But Sanjay himself overacts terribly, especially during obvious adlibs.  The directorial style of writerdirector Krishna Wamsi is sloppy, rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts, although his camera movement is good.  The musical underscore is also quite effective, moody, featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble too bad little if any of that made it onto SHAKTIs soundtrack cd, but Bollywood has not yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums, at least not in most cases.  But SHAKTI is Karisma Kapoors film, all the way, though, and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to India contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with Sanjay in the initial Canadian scenes.  Despite the unevenness of much of the picture, Karismas performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures.  In a strange way, also, I found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty I would noticed in CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER and MARIE ANTOINETTE, both of which I would seen just prior, although SHAKTI of course is an entirely different kind of film; but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the austerity of terrorismcontrolled poverty in India rather than the elegance of Versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal Chinas Tang Dynasty  whose selfserving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext.",

His throwaway comicbook dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the films primary gripping drama.  The cast is nicely supported by Nana Patekar as the warlord, and the elegant Deepti Naval who is outstanding as his longsuffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the films best scenes; Ritu Shivpuri and Rajshree Solanki are also very good as Sanjays sisters in India, and very pleasing eye candy.  But Sanjay himself overacts terribly, especially during obvious adlibs.  The directorial style of writerdirector Krishna Wamsi is sloppy, rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts, although his camera movement is good.  The musical underscore is also quite effective, moody, featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble too bad little if any of that made it onto SHAKTIs soundtrack cd, but Bollywood has not yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums, at least not in most cases.  But SHAKTI is Karisma Kapoors film, all the way, though, and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to India contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with Sanjay in the initial Canadian scenes.  Despite the unevenness of much of the picture, Karismas performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures.  In a strange way, also, I found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty I would noticed in CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER and MARIE ANTOINETTE, both of which I would seen just prior, although SHAKTI of course is an entirely different kind of film; but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the austerity of terrorismcontrolled poverty in India rather than the elegance of Versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal Chinas Tang Dynasty  whose selfserving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext.",

		"This is the Who at their most powerful.  Although before the masterwork Who is Next, which would provide anthems like Baba Oreily and Wont Get Fooled Again.  This film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the 70s.Daltrey shows what being a frontman is all about, Entwistle steady as ever.  Moon is ongoing conversation Townsend even looks like he is enjoying himself occasionally! Considering they took to the stage at 2am no one in the crowd was asleep!  There are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in 36 years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one.",
		"This review is dedicated to the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle.The Original Drum and Bass.There seems to be very little early Who footage around these days, if there is more then lets be aving it, nowadays it tends to be of a very different kind of Who altogether, a parody, a shadow of their much better years.  To be fair, not one of them has to prove anything to anyone anymore, they have earned their respect and with overtime.This concert footage for me is one of their best.  To command an audience of around a 400,000 plus strong crowed takes skill, charisma, wit and a whole lot of bloody good music.We all know of the other acts on the bill, The Doors their last ever show weeks before Jim Morrison died, Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many more.  The point being that whoever were there it was The Who that the majority had come to see.  This show was one year after the Great Hippie Fest of the 1960s; Woodstock.  The film and record had come out and so had The Who is greatest work to date, Tommy.  The ever hungry crowd wanted a taste, to be able to experience their own unique event, to be able to Grove and Love in the knowledge that this gig was their own.  you needed late August Pete had white boiler The crowed went wild.  This is what they had come to hear, and the Who did not disappoint, straight into Overture and never coming up for air until the final note of Tommy can you Hear me?  Amazing.To capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a Festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the World was a fantastic piece of Cinematic History.The English DVD only comes in a soundtrack of EnglishLinear PCM Stereo, were as in the States, I think, you can get it with 5.1 at least, Check local press for details on that, okay.The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes with no extras, which is a disappointment.  Yes, for a slice of Rock and Festival History this DVD would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play, for some of the best Who concert footage as it was meant to be, Live, Raw and in your Face! I would have given this DVD ten if it was not for the lack of 5.1, and some extras would have been nice.Thanks Roger, Pete, John and Keith.",

		"This would have worked a lot better if it had been made as Mitchell in Malta.  At least then we would have been spared the sight of Joe Don Baker running around an otherwise scenic Mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit...not to mention acting like an Old West gunslinger.  Mitchell being gratuitous police Oh well.  At least the comic comments of Mike and the Bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of MST.  I cannot imagine watching it on it is own, however.",
		"Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material, and almost always under appreciated.  He is solid presence Baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor, and that is what is so great about him.  He really seems to mean what he is saying, regardless of how clich?, obvious or silly, which puts him in a league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud.  It is what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy work so well, and that same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE.  This was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era.  By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there is a real timeless quality that does not jar you away from the action on screen.  To be honest, I have always enjoyed the films of Greydon Clark, who is a nononsense director in the same vein as 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his best.  FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost gems of the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true grit and violence.  I suppose if they remake this with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to love it as much as I do.",

As expected, it did not do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since MMFF is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies.It was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in Filipino or English play out in the screen.  I thought Cesar Montano did a good job both as a star and director.  His great vision and creativity really helped this film.  He was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film.  Also performing well was young actress Rebecca Lusterio.  She did a great job portraying Bikay, the younger sister of Duroy.  I hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres.  I think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her.Some of the camera shots in the film were done very well.

		"On Sunday July 27, 1997, the first episode of a new science fiction series called Stargate SG1 was broadcast on Showtime.  A spinoff of and sequel to the 1994 film Stargate starring Kurt Russell and James Spader, the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film.  For ten seasons, it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as SG1.  Originally, the series starred Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack ONeill two ls! , Michael Shanks as Dr.  Daniel Jackson, Amanda Tapping as Captain Samantha Carter, Christopher Judge as Tealc and Don S.  Davis as Major General George S.  Hammond.  For ten long years, we watched the team battle against the Goauld, the Replicators, the Ori and many other aggressors.  At the same time, they forged alliances with the Asgard, the Tokra, the rebel Jaffa, the Nox and the Tollan.  They saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up, not until death claimed them.  And sometimes not even then.As with all longrunning series, they were numerous cast changes.  Michael Shanks left the series in January 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor.  Daniel Jacksons successor as the teams resident archaeologistgeek was Jonas Quinn, an alien from a country called Kelowna on the planet Langara, played by Corin Nemec.  Shanks returned seventh season Nemec left same time Unfortunately, he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards.  Don S.  Davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in March 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go.  The show is original star and arguably its most popular actor, Richard Dean Anderson, starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons.  His participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons.  He finally left SG1 in March 2005 in order to spend more time with his then sixyearold daughter.  Jack ONeill was by far my favourite character in the series and, truth be told, I never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as I did the earlier episodes for that very reason.The ninth season represented a new era for the programme.  With the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the Goauld and the Replicators in Season Eight, many fans felt the series should go out on a high.  Regardless, the series carried on for a further two years with the Ori replacing the Goauld as the series main adversaries.  Three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this reinvention.  Ben Browder came in as the cocky Southern Air Force pilot Lt.  Colonel Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG1.  His Farscape costar, the lovely Claudia Black, began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious, sexy, hilarious and certainly extroverted Vala Mal Doran, a former Goauld host and con artist from another planet.  A recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons, she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season.  Rounding off the cast was the legendary Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry, the new commander of the SGC and an old friend of Jack ONeill and General Hammond.  For the last two years, they starred alongside the SG1 faithful Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the Stargate franchise.Alas, all good things must come to an end.  During the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of Season Ten, ratings dropped considerably, resulting in cancellation in its August 2006.  After ten seasons and 214 episodes, the dream was finally over.  On March 13, 2007, what began with Children of the Gods ended with Unending.  The series finale made its world premiere on Sky One in Britain and Ireland before being shown on the SciFi Channel in the United States on June 22, 2007.In the ten years that the series was on the air, it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series, Star Trek, in terms of popularity in certain countries.  It became the secondlongest running scifi series in the world, second only to Doctor Who 19631989, and the longestrunning American produced scifi series, having surpassed The XFiles only a few months before it ended.Stargate SG1 represents the cornerstone of the Stargate franchise.  In 2004, its success and popularity led to the production of a spinoff series entitled Stargate Atlantis, which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in August 2008.  Although plans for another feature film fell through, two directtoDVD films, Stargate The Ark of Truth and Stargate Continuum, were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future.  A third liveaction series, Stargate Universe, is also due to premiere at some point next year.  There was, unfortunately, an animated series, Stargate Infinity, which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better.  Despite the end of SG1 and Atlantis as continuing series, the future of Stargate looks very bright indeed.In conclusion, while Stargate has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major scifi television franchises such as Star Trek and Doctor Who, its still relatively new compared to those two scifi giants and I have every confidence that it will continue for many, many years to come.",

However, Shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in June 2003 and Nemec left at the same time.  Unfortunately, he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards.  Don S.  Davis left seventh season The show is original star and arguably its most popular actor, Richard Dean Anderson, starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons.  His participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons.  He finally left SG1 in March 2005 in order to spend more time with his then sixyearold daughter.  Jack ONeill was by far my favourite character in the series and, truth be told, I never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as I did the earlier episodes for that very reason.The ninth season represented a new era for the programme.  With the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the Goauld and the Replicators in Season Eight, many fans felt the series should go out on a high.  Regardless, the series carried on for a further two years with the Ori replacing the Goauld as the series main adversaries.  Three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this reinvention.  Ben Browder came in as the cocky Southern Air Force pilot Lt.  Colonel Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG1.  His Farscape costar, the lovely Claudia Black, began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious, sexy, hilarious and certainly extroverted Vala Mal Doran, a former Goauld host and con artist from another planet.  A recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons, she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season.  Rounding off the cast was the legendary Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry, the new commander of the SGC and an old friend of Jack ONeill and General Hammond.  For the last two years, they starred alongside the SG1 faithful Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the Stargate franchise.Alas, all good things must come to an end.  During the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of Season Ten, ratings dropped considerably, resulting in cancellation in its August 2006.  After ten seasons and 214 episodes, the dream was finally over.  On March 13, 2007, what began with Children of the Gods ended with Unending.  The series finale made its world premiere on Sky One in Britain and Ireland before being shown on the SciFi Channel in the United States on June 22, 2007.In the ten years that the series was on the air, it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series, Star Trek, in terms of popularity in certain countries.  It became the secondlongest running scifi series in the world, second only to Doctor Who 19631989, and the longestrunning American produced scifi series, having surpassed The XFiles only a few months before it ended.Stargate SG1 represents the cornerstone of the Stargate franchise.  In 2004, its success and popularity led to the production of a spinoff series entitled Stargate Atlantis, which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in August 2008.  Although plans for another feature film fell through, two directtoDVD films, Stargate The Ark of Truth and Stargate Continuum, were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future.  A third liveaction series, Stargate Universe, is also due to premiere at some point next year.  There was, unfortunately, an animated series, Stargate Infinity, which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better.  Despite the end of SG1 and Atlantis as continuing series, the future of Stargate looks very bright indeed.In conclusion, while Stargate has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major scifi television franchises such as Star Trek and Doctor Who, its still relatively new compared to those two scifi giants and I have every confidence that it will continue for many, many years to come.",

Pure abstraction is not really my thing, but I can take it in small doses and the supersaturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers, Rohrschach blots, birds, etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful.  Certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s, and deserves to be better known.",

It is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose.  It was great to see her character transformation in this movie, considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get.  I hope for a sequel very soon.  we want live action I do not think Lady Death would transfer well to film.

I thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie.  Quite animeesque or more like some of the American movies following this new trend of adult animation.

Read the comics you will not regret it.  we do artistic work I mean seriously do not get me wrong these people did great, but different versions for different people.  Different Strokes for different folks as the saying goes.  Any guy who does not go bonkers over her is insane, or does not like women, or you know just plan insane.

I would have preferred that New Yorker Films had translated the title directly.  It is good for Americans to stretch a little.  If the films title helps the US audience to explore random chaos, all the better.  Cinema imitates life  visa versa.Also, I found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars.  Come on!  The euro is not hard to figure out, make the gringo audiences do the math.  Seeing a film, especially one shot in Paris, the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded I am an American watching a movie and they are translating the Euros into dollars for me.

		"Seldom do we see such short comments written by IMDb filmgoers.  Perhaps it is because this lightweight dark comedy entertains and pleases without depth, or are we missing something?  I would watch it again if I had some incentive.So what is a happenstance?  To the French it is Le Battement dAiles du Papillon Serendipity?  Fate?  Perhaps it is an event that is the culmination of a series of random happenings.  We have major life All these incidents cause other events that ... well you get the picture?  Dominoes.  Multiply those by 30 characters and an average of 6 each and you have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario could happen.  And I think that there is a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this.  But then this is the magic world of cinema.We admit that it is fun to watch the way the writerdirector weaves together these unrelated events into a story which enmeshes the lives of these French citizens.

All these incidents cause other events that ... well you get the picture?  Dominoes.

		"Happenstance is New Yorkfeeling A film from last year released now to capitalize on the attention Audrey Tatou is getting for Amelie, its French title is more apt Le Battement dailes du papillon The Beating of the Butterflys Wings as in summarizing chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives.Tatous gamineness is less annoying here because she only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile amidst her hapless adventures, and because she is part of a large, multiethnic ensemble, so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters, especially as some of the cute guys and older women looked alike to me, and some of the characters fantasize what they should do such that I was not sure if they were doing that or not.  But I loved how urban the coincidences were, from immigrants to love nests to crowded subway cars to hanging around caf?s.The subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once.originally written 1282001",

		"it is few seasons My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth.  Stargate SG1 is more than just a simple scifi series, it is one of the most well made, interesting, long running, exciting scifi ever produced.  And why?  Because it runs on an amazing premise.This series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and I think it is a very good example that television, as a medium, with a suitable premise, is able to provide something that does not work on the time restriction of film.  The sense of familiarity created by a long running series, watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief, and it is all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show.Stargate SG1 kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years, but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show  The first few seasons, perhaps up to the 4th5th, focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending Goauld threat.   From the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the Goauld and preventing attacks on Earth.  After this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg1 in a place of Goauldreplicatorori conflicts The 8th season is probably the most mixed one.  It has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned, but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments.   The 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no Jack ONeil.  They are both good continuations, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, because they seem to be about little more than SG1 and humanJaffa losing battle after battle to the Ori.Basically, after season 7, exploration was pushed to the background, which in many ways was a shame, because of the potential and mystery each planetepisode presented; on the other hand, it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were.Even tough I believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest, the feeling I have is that it could go on; the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer.  A last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome, but ultimately things are as they are.In the end, because of the fact that I enjoyed everything, it is a little hard to find that it ends.  The big picture, however, the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years, is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew, those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of SG1.",

		"Narratives  whether written, visual or poetic epics  generally try to avoid too may characters; readers and viewers, after all, can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who.  This is especially true in film, I think, simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema.  I was complex stories we see complex stories This earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways more characters and more complexity.Now, other directors have used those techniques before Robert Altman with The Player 1992, Short Cuts 1993, Gosford Park 2001 and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia 1999.  Stanley Kramer did it with A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, a comedy of almost epic proportions.  The difference with this film is, first the director lets us see inside the head of some of the characters and second, some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewers memory as the story flipflops between different time periods.The basic  the core, so to speak  story concerns a young woman, Irene Tautou who is told, by a fellow commuter on a train, that she will meet her true love on that day.  This occurs in the first few minutes of the film.  The clever irony at this point is that Irene does not realize that the young man opposite Gilbert Robin may be that one true love.  And, nor does he...They go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter.  However, chaos results throughout the rest of the day, not only for the two young people, but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere, and yet...If the story were simply that, it could tend to be boring, and even quite predictable.  Not so.  The script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too commonplace, but which are turned into believable, extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again.  For example, the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours, consider your alternatives; two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before Irene and her man of destiny meet again.  Or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen?  Consider again what would happen...All of that is interesting enough.  What was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was THE ONE for Irene, or whether it was, in fact, the young man on the train.  That kept me guessing for a while.I will let you think about that, should you see this delightful romp.Recommended for all.",

Or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen?  Consider again what would happen...All of that is interesting enough.  What was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was THE ONE for Irene, or whether it was, in fact, the young man on the train.  you see delightful romp.Recommended",

		"This whimsical film had the misfortune of being released at the same time of the highly popular Amelie, both having the wonderful Audrey Tautou playing the central role.  Laurent Firode, the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of France in recent memory.The film deals with chance, as its English title indicates.  The French title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the Atlantic as they fly, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects.  From the start, the director interlaces all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other, something that is hard to imagine, but in the films context seems to work well.A chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film.  Irene, who is going to work, is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her Zodiac sign is and proceeds to read from her paper.  Irene, it seems will cross paths and will find her soul mate that same day.  he has same birth It seems they are destined to one another from the start, but alas, they will not reconnect until the last frame of the film.Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene.  Faudel, who plays Younes, does not have a lot to do until the end, but he shows he has a presence and plays well his part.  The talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as butterfly wings.We look forward to future films by Laurent Firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected.",

		"I like other reviews I just watched this movie again, and I must reiterate that it has the BEST ending to any movie.  Ever.  Ever.  Ever.  The real translation, The Beating of the Butterflys Wings, is oddly not used as the translated title.  I suppose they thought most Americans would not know what Chaos Theory is except for those who saw or read Jurassic Park.  The movie is based on chaos theory, and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events, which all lead back to one event.  The movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect, as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters about 20?.  In a way, the ending seems inevitable despite this, but if you think about it, it is a perfect ending.  Think to yourself, what else needed to be said?  It is at the same time a very brave ending.  Too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one, but an ending like this would NEVER come out of Hollywood.",

		"it is real life Amelie was real life movies featuring real life Yes, it is true, there is a big gap after the first scene where she is not seen at all for maybe 45 min, but I did not even miss her because I was having so much fun with the other characters.  The guy who lies about everything is too funny, the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss, actually.... getting into all the characters here could take quite a while, but this is one of the best movies I have seen in a while.Audrey Tautous character Irene is not the overdone sugary girl that Amelie was.  In fact, as Irene, her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first.  In this film, Irene is a girl with good intentions, but over the course of a very awful day, her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic.What makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building... very entertaining to watch, great scenery and shots, very colorful and never too slow, and all of the characters can actually act.  The best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left.... this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense, and the whole butterfly effect blossoms.  I swear, it was the best 20 minutes of film I have seen in quite a while, and the ending....  It made me think damn I really lucked out finding this movie.  The ending to this movie is top notch.  Whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant, because not only are there all these other subplots going on, but to somehow make them all tie in together and in a sensible manner, which is the case here but also to make each character feel human and come alive, not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect... very impressive.I highly suggest this movie as it is a great film to watch anytime, in any mood, with any company or alone.",

Some folks might think that was an improvement.  I do not.  Who was the mogul who said If you want to send a message, call Western Union?  He was right.  These psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy.This one is a pip.  It is about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead fathers estate.

He is initially in it for the bucks, but eventually falls for her.  Meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance.  The results are predictable.  You get a little bit of everything in this movie.  Sexual tension between the sisters.  A little subtle masochism.  Hereditary insanity  if there is such a thing.  We never get to meet the parents, but they must really have been screwed up The cast is practically unknown.  One or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar.  The acting is so bad it is hard to believe.  It was released under the United Artists umbrella by a company called BelAir Productions.  It was shot in and around LA mostly at night and probably without permits.  The end was so bizarre that I thought it was a joke.

		"When a rich tycoon is killed in a plane crash, his spinster twin sister, Martha Craig Madge Kennedy, does not believe he grabbed the controls in a suicide dive even though selfsnuff runs in the family but his three beautiful daughters could not care less.  The pilot, Jim Norton John Bromfield, goes to work for Valerie Craig Kathleen Hughes who soon coerces him into helping her wrest control of the estate from her troubled sister, Lorna Sara Shane and the family lawyer Jess Barker.  Valerie wants Norton to seduce Lorna when he is not fending off the advances of another sister, the nymphet Vicki Marla English, but her plans are thrown into a tailspin when Norton falls for his prey.  All bets are off as a world of woe including corporate chicanery, seductions, suicides, blackmail, a murder plot, the Mann Act, doublecrosses, disfigurement, and poetic justice befall Craig Manor, an imposing mansion on a bluff overlooking the sea...This preposterous potboiler would have made a perfect second feature for WRITTEN ON THE WIND, also from 1956.  Douglas Sirks saga of a powerful and powerfully dysfunctional oil clan was said to have inspired the 1980s nighttime TV serial DALLAS but the Craigs lowbrow excursion into insanity seems right out of it is sinful sistersoap, DYNASTY.  All three siblings only one of whom is really bad are great beauties but it is Kathleen Hughes cartoon villainy that stands out.  Valerie is relentless in her quest to inherit the family fortune and her unbridled enthusiasm for evil is one of the movies many guilty pleasures.

		"That hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say.  It is own terms Only two of the sisters are really bad.  Boy, are they bad, too!  One is given to pinup poses and salacious comments where eer she goes.  The other is got up to look like Marilyn Monroe.  She has those sensual, slightly parted lips.  And, not to give anything away, she is even more bad than the other.All three sisters are played by starlets.  The man who stumbles into their lives is played by John Bromfield.  He had something of a career.This looks today like possibly the first mainstream softcore porn ever marketed.  Well, of course not the first but the raciest at that time.The girls wear as little as possible and let us not forget about the female audience members Bromfield is shown shaving with an electric razor  whose fetish was this?   barechested.  He also is shown sopping wet in a swimsuit.There is a real plot here, too The girls family, see, is cursed.  They are prone to suicide  or dramatic deaths that can be made to seem like suicide.The movie is not bad.  I truly do not know where it was shown.  Maybe it was made for driveins.  Somehow, and I could be wrong, I felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here.  The women are scantily dressed.  They often resemble lurid covers of mags like Police Detective or jackets of dime novels.But the guy seems to be the central focus.  Not everyone in the movie likes him, but all the girls love him.  And I think the audience is meant to also.It is lots of fun  and on its own terms, too.",

		"... and I DO mean it.  If not literally after all, I have not seen every movie ever created! , at least, obviously, among the ones, the many I know.5.3 ???  The rule of thumb with IMDb is this sometimes movies rated very highly for example, the piece of KannesKompetitionKrownedKoreanKraap called Oldboy can be truly bad.  But rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6.  This movie, very much worth watching, is.  A disgrace.True, I give it a 10 in protest.  The movie is not perfect.  Its true rating should be an 8 or a 9.  It has some acting flaws Belafonte especially, the script wanders around, sometimes.  However, what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times, the Czech Jan Kadar, directing two of the greatest actors of all time, the beloved, largerthanlife Zero Mostel and the sublime Ida Kaminska in an actingpoeticmoral tour de force.  A pair made in Heaven!  It is little flaws It is American Beauty",

They dethaw the beast, jolt him back to life with electric charges, grossly mistreat him, and keep the poor hairy Goliath in an enormous glass booth.  Before you can say Hey, the filmmakers are obviously ripping off King Kong, our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage, grabs the first luscious nubile blonde Euro vixen the gorgeous Pheonix Grant he lays lustful eyes on, and storms away with his new lady love.

Of course, he breaks free again, nabs the vixen, and goes on the expected stomping around the city rampage.The sublimely stupid dialogue sample line Philosophy has no place in science, professor, cheesy far from special effects the horrendous transparent blue screen work and cruddy Tonka toy miniatures are especially uproarious in their very jawdropping awfulness, clunky misdirection, and a heavyhanded script that even attempts a clumsily sincere Is the yeti a man or a beast?  ethical debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar its absurd way across the big screen.  Better still, we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yetis nipples, which causes it to harden and elicits a big, leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth ! ; the vixen nurses the yetis wounded hand while he makes googoo eyes at her, the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building, and the furry fellow even breaks a mans neck with his toes !!.

		"Being a giant monster fan, me seeing Yeti was an absolute must, especially after hearing so much about it.  it is cheesy giantmonster It kicks in pretty quickly as Yeti is found pretty much immediately, and we get introduced to various characters.  They consist of some sleazy ones, some good ones, and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy scifi film, by far.Yeti looks like a longhaired guy straight out of the original Woodstock concert, and really, he is not that bad of a dude, especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cagelike thing.  Godzilla he is not  despite his rude awakening, he does not even rampage actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture, but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out.  Yeti seems to understand English pretty nicely my copy was dubbed in English and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are.However, we want to see the giant Yeti do his thing, and he is pretty much in the whole movie, and in typical lowbudget fashion, he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there is even a bunch of the fake legs shots of him just standing there.Yes, the special effects are not the greatest, but there are definitely some good ones here.  A scene where Yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well, and in another, he uses the windows of a building as ladder steps to climb down from the top of it  shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside  in one sequence that really looks much, much better than it should in such a bad movie.Yeti never stoops as low as say, A.P.E. does.  Actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes Yetis nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an oh yeah baby manner.  But even this is not that bad, and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer.The movie is pretty long for this kind of thing, but surprisingly enough it does not get boring  the story is actually good, and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy.Yeti may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks, but it is definitely better than other King Kong 76 ripoffs like A.P.E. and Queen Kong by very far.",

		"People forget several King Godzilla, King Kong 1976, they all ripoff one another, but YETI stands on its own.  It only borrows one element from King Kong and that is the animals attraction with one female.The YETI myth is based on Bigfoot not like King Kongand archeologists have been fascinated it, at one time they did exist,but there is no scientific data to prove it.This movie is hard to find ,but its worth watching it.  The first time I watched it was on Elviras Mistress of the Dark Shows in the early 1980s.  It sent chills down my spine as a kid, especially when the YETI got mad.  I saw it again, around 100am on ABC about 2 to 3yrs ago.  Seeing it again made me appreciate it more, it has some overall good effects for its time and the story involves a mute boy and his dog, and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the YETI for his own purposes.  Also the music is pretty cool,its very YETI like.  Gianfranco Parolini and the Yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere.Vote 7 and half out of 10.",

I would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever, or rather the one he took the most chances with, and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids  families.

I would rank this up there with KING KONG VERSUS GODZILLA and IT!  CURSE OF THE GREAT GOLEM as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever.  Because the movie looks so fake you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked, trampled, tossed about and smashed.  Knowing that and armed with a fertile, energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie, Parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie I will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend.

It is ancient china The action is fantastic, the story is tense and entertaining, and the set design is truely memorable.

		"I have always been keen on watching Hong Kong movies, but all of them failed to meet my expectations...until now!  BURNING PARADISE does not contain the flat humor most HK movies have, nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film.  it is true HK Hollywood is true HK There are some incredible fight scenes in this movie, from the first onewhich is one of the coolest I have ever seen, yet so short to the last main scenes!  But mind, there is also a lot of blood that flows people cut in half, decapitated, etc.  The production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical notice the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall!.  Yep, it is not Tsui Hark or John Woo that made my favorite Hong Kong film, it is Ringo Lam!  And I am sure as hell going to check out more from this director!  Ace.",
		"I have always been keen on watching Hong Kong movies, but all of them failed to meet my expectations...until now!  BURNING PARADISE does not contain the flat humor most HK movies have, nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film.  The story is not complex, but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some intelligent space the only truely intelligent martial arts film I have seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but since Hollywood is involved it is no true HK movie for me.  There are some incredible fight scenes in this movie, from the first onewhich is one of the coolest I have ever seen, yet so short to the last main scenes!

		"An unusual film from Ringo Lam and one that is strangely underappreciated.  The mix of fantasy kungfu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes.  A horseback rider get chopped in two and his waist and legs keep riding the horse.  Several horses get chopped up.  It is unexpected.The story It is crazed maniac The General has a similarity to Kurtz in Apocalypse Now as he spouts warped philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood.  The production is very impressive and the setting is bleak.  Blood is everywhere.  The action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many HK action scenes from the time.  Sometimes the movie veers into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but it is never bad enough to ruin the film.  Find this one, it is one of the best HK kung fu films from the early nineties.  Just remember it is not child friendly.",

		"This is one of the finest films to come out of Hong Kongs New Wave that began with Tsui Harks ZU Warriors of Magic Mountain.  Tsui set martial arts Tsui set outright comedy Burning Paradise put a stop to all that, and with a vengeance.It is not that there is not humor here; but it is a purely human humor, as with the aged Buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw.  But this is just as humans are, not even Buddhist priests can be saints all the time.When irony is at last introduced into the film, it is the nastiest possible, emanating from the abbot of Red Lotus Temple, who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before.  He is the very incarnation of Miltons Satan from Paradise Lost Better to rule in Hell than serve in heaven!  And if he cannot get to Satans hell soon enough, he will turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule.That is the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here It is not that the Abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to despair, to feel utterly hopeless, to accept his nihilism as allencompassing reality.  Thus there is a definite sense pervading the Red Temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the Temple itself  it has become all there is to the universe, and the Abbot, claiming mastery of infinite power, is in charge.Of course, fortunately, the film does not end there.  Though there are losses, the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails.  If you want to know how, see the film!  Yet there is no doubt that, in viewing this film, we visit hell.  Hopefully, we do not witness our own afterlives; but we certainly feel chastened by the experience  and somehow better for it over all.",

		"People expect no less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs a movie, and this movie is no exception.  Some movies I love did poorly at the box office but, I am glad to say, this movie is not one of them over nine million dollars, which I do not think was bad for back then.  The characters were fun, the animation was clear and not fuzzy, and the music was modern, too, which is unusual for an animated movie.  I did little kids I thought creepy professor I did creepy professor Overall, this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that I have loved dearly for years.",
		"I disagree with Anyone who donet like this movie.  I used to LOVE this movie when I was little and I still do.  It is sweet, funny and warms your heart.  And It proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed.  And even though it did not have much of a story, it was still excellent I give it a 10 and two thumbs up.  Oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wishs and dreams can come true.  Tear, tearI love this movie, personally if anyone says it sucked than I will say Shame on you.  it was little movie it was little movie",

Main characters Rex the Tyrannosaurus rex, Elsa the pterodactyl, Dweeb the Parasarolophus, Ooo the Triceratops, a boy called Louis, a girl called Cecilia and Captain Neweyes. ?  Actors John Goodman Rex, Yeardley Smith Cecilia, Martin Short Stubbs the clown, Felicity Kendal Elsa etc.? What happens Four dinosaurs see above are fed some brain grain cereal and are now cuddly, friendly dinosaurs who are going to be nice to children.  They go big plans They go animated film The animation of the dinosaurs when they go cuddly and friendly is a bit floppy and notsogood, but they look pleasant all the same that way.  I like the dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly, they are nice, friendly and good.  I like almost all the characters featured, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I like the others as well.  Overall, I like this film a lot!  Recommended to People who like good childrens animated films, people who like dinosaurs, John Goodman and people who think that circuses are not always what they seem Enjoy! ",
		"I do IMDb ratings I do IMDb ratings It does not wow me as much at 17, but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie.  Kids will definitely love it and will not mind the flaws, and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film.  None of the film was preachy in any way, in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness.  I will admit though that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like Screweyess deathwhich still freaks me out may be a tad on the scary side.  But the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation.  The music by James Horner is very beautiful, and the song featured is memorable, catchy and amusing.  I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the most indepth of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least engaging.  Martin Shorts clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the part when he tells Screweyes I quit!  had me in stitches.  My favourite is Screweyes though, an effective villain who is crafty and I suppose intelligent.  If anything though, I wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could have been more developed in terms of depth.  The script, while not Oscarworthy, has its funny and heartwarming parts, and should keep kids and adults entertained.  The voice acting for me was what made the movie.  John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith all gave solid performances, but special mention has to go to Kenneth Mars for he was absolutely superb as Screweyes and almost unrecognisable.  All in all, this is a good movie.  I do not get the rating, honestly I do not.  Sure this film is not perfect, and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as Land Before Time, but it is good fun. 7.510 Bethany Cox",

		"I saw little sister What stood out for me was the lack of midmovie conflict that so many movies have, where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just do not say the one thing that you are shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal, that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say.  This is what I like the most about the movie I guess, that the main characters do not do mean things to each other halfway through... they do not break up and make up, they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on.These two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track, they are not that different.  Loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family, and Cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone.  Anyway, I saw this movie posted on Hulu and had to watch it again... sure there is plot holes if you analyze the script and no, Woog and Dweeb should not be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality.Now, what detracts from the film is it is unexpected scariness.  Little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with Dr.  Screweyes.  And, the addition of him halfway through the movie though it is blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance is too abrupt... there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie, perhaps to show that it is not that scary without the the dinosaurs.  I guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie, so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half.Considering the target audience, who I am sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues...  I think I will give it a pass on those factors too, and just enjoy the story.  It is a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind... makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years I think.",

Anyway, I saw this movie posted on Hulu and had to watch it again... sure there is plot holes if you analyze the script and no, Woog and Dweeb should not be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality.Now, what detracts from the film is it is unexpected scariness.  Little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with Dr.  Screweyes.  And, the addition of him halfway through the movie though it is blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance is too abrupt... there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie, perhaps to show that it is not that scary without the the dinosaurs.  I guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie, so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half.Considering the target audience, who I am sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues...  I think I will give it a pass on those factors too, and just enjoy the story.  It is great flick It is great flick",

		"I would not call We are Back!  A Dinosaurs Story simply a kiddie version of Jurassic Park.  I found it more interesting than that.  Like the former, it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours.  But it really opens my eyes when I see who provided the voices John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King.  To paraphrase that a given actor, the Cheers woman, the Tonight Show host, the Most Trusted Name In News, a famous chef, the Young Frankenstein police chief, Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos and the CNN guy.But I guess that I should not focus only on the cast.  I thought natural history True, it is escapism, but the perceptive kind.  I would actually say that John Goodman doing Rexs voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in Monsters Inc.  Worth seeing.",
		"This movie has to be my favorite of all time.  it was real snuff This was an exercise in visual effects, and does not cut away when the action happens like every other film does.  Movies these days are now all about sound effects, leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with CGI blood.  There still are movie makers who still cannot get fake blood to look like the real thing.  There is no rape scene because that was not the point of making the film.  Have you seen the hills have eyes 2?  The rape scene was funny instead of shocking.  Although i am sure there are some GONZO porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror.  But since they probably suck at making films, they probably would not be able to pull it off.  The movie Baise Moi has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks.Its too bad that a movie cannot be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all, especially when talking about an AO or NC17 rating.  I am sure Eli Roth has the abilitytalent to make his Hostel film series much much better, but he has too tame it down to get an R rating...or at least I hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations.Watch Traces of Death or More than Smashed Pumpkins if you want no frills real footage accident  crime scenesfootage.  Do not forget that this movie was made in 1985.  The fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film.  That would be like someone saying the 8bit Super Mario Brothers sucks because the PS3 has better graphics.",

		"I first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick Snuff.  I was told that Devils Experiment was much better so naturally I went ahead and ordered the Guinea Pig box set.  I was short film Just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes.  They torture her in various ways like beating her, spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to hipitched noise for 24 hours, smash her hand with a mallet, burning and putting maggots on the burns, throwing guts at her, and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye.I must say that a lot of this movie was fake, like the beating scenes.  But then, some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out.  The scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it.  Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about.  The worst is the eye scene.  I did not shutter when watching it but simply thought Damn, that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie.  I did enjoy the flick but I do not know if I can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 710",

		"This is the first out of the Guinea Pig series, and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection.It took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films.  I bought the Guinea Pig Box Set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date.  I had full force This ended up not being the case.The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point, and how long a human can tolerate pain.Sounds like one sick flick right?  Wrong.  The film fails to shock.  This may be because I have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror, but I think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with ease.On the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen.  Though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence.  Including the ripping out of fingernails, intestines thrown at an unconscious woman, and a needle through the eye.Overall I think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it, but I suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one.",

I do strong Shanks In the early years, the Jackson character came off as a whiner.  That is why I probably was not a fan.  As the seasons pasted, the character became stronger.  This gave him confidence.  In the end, as of season 10, the Jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero.  He still monitors the groups ethics.  He still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward.  Acheaology, History, Culture and Exploration are part of his very being.  He is determined.  Though a man of peace, he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement.  Other characters include, most recently Vala Mal DoranClaudia Black and Colonel Cameron MitchellBen Browder, new lead of SG1.  Both actors come from a series called Farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess.  I see little difference between Mitchell and Crichton Farscape character.

		"I have not always been a fan, but the show grew on me.  It was not until after season 5 that I started to see the richness of the show.  They finally brought Daniel Jacksons search for his wife to an end and finally most of the Go,ould System Lords were killed by rival Lords, SG1 or others.Towards Season 5, Stargate SG1, was beginning to become stale.  With the new writers and the close attention by Produer Peter Deleuise, the show became more and more solid.The characters had become stale as well.  Colonel Jack ONeill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage.  After his son Charlie was killed in a shooting accident with ONeills weapon, he had decided to end his own life by going to Abydos in order to face off with the Goould RA.  The character offers little growth for any actor and actor Richard Dean Anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself. only allowing his close friends in.Amanda Tapping joined the cast as Captain Samantha Carter.  She was a feminist on the edge, ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job.  Though this character had little area to grow, Tapping has done a great job of concentrating on Carters strengths.  She has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things Carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently.  Christopher Judge joined the cast playing the alien Tealc.  Tealc was an alien called the Jaffa.  Infant Goould, snake like creatures would embed themselves into the Jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form.  The Jaffa would die.  Tealc was the First Prime of Apophis army.  Knowing that Apophis was not a god like Goould pretend, he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy.  Finally, having had enough, he and Jack ONeill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people.  After arriving on Earth, he realized that Earth was the planet he was looking for, who would help him fight the Goould.  Christopher Judge has done quite a bit with a limited character.  Tealc is a wise warrior, much of which he learned was from his teacher Master Bratac.  The show would not be complete without Master Bratac played by Tony Amandola.  He is also a rock.  In the end, he became adviser to most of SG1, especially Daniel Jackson.  Don S.  Davil was there from the beginning playing Major General George Hammand.

He does not leave anyone behind.I saved Dr.  Daniel Jackson for last, because this character, I believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on.  In choosing Shanks I do not think the producer realized how strong Shanks would be and now when people talk about Jackson, they do not talk about Spader, they talk about Shanks.  In the early years, the Jackson character came off as a whiner.  That is why I probably was not a fan.  As the seasons pasted, the character became stronger.  This gave him confidence.

This is what they do They beat her, put her in a net and let her hang inside like birdfood, spin her around on a chair until she pukes, expose her to loud noise, pour boiling oil on her, put worms in her sores, crush her hand with a sledgehammer and finally pokes a needle through her eye.This movie was so realistic that if I did not know it was fake I would have thought it was a snuffmovie.  Although I was disgusted by this movie i really liked it.  It scared me.  I guess it fills some kind of purpose.  I give it a 1010.",

The series received a great deal of publicity when American actor Charlie Sheen, believing the series to contain actual murder, attempted to ban its distribution in the United States.  An FBI investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers  sick recreations using nasty, but obvious special effects.

		"Wow, alot of reviews for the Devils Experiment are here.  Wonderful.  My name is Steve and I run Unearthed Films.  We just started releasing the Guinea Pig films on DVD for North America.  Now before you ask why am I writing a review?  Instead ask why some people bash it.  I am writing this review because I love the Guinea Pig films.  Why do I love em, it is because they go for the throat and they do not let go.  I have seen it all.  Almost every horror film known to man, Argento, Fulci, Bava, Buttgereit. from every underground cult sensation to every Hollywood blockbuster.  I have seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the Guinea Pig films.  we watch 1st place This review is for the Devils Experiment.  I find it devoid of story which is fine by me.  Why do I watch horror films?  So I can see blood and gore and the torture of people.  The Devils Experiment not only delivers but that is all it is.  Pure unadulterated violence.  Yeah I like a story but sometimes I just want the gore and the Devils Experiment delivers ten fold.  Why do people bash it.  Cause they like a story, so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story.  It make em feel better about themselves.  We all want blood and gore.  It is just really hard to justify it if it is not wrapped around a story.  The Guinea Pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released.I am thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world.  Maybe I should not have written this review but then again maybe I should.  My view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it is not.  I have always told people to find them and to watch them way before I started Unearthed Films.  Sure it is exploitive and over the top but is not that why we watch horror films in the 1st place.  The Devils Experiment is NOT for everybody.  It is for thrill seekers and gorehounds only.  If you think Jason movies and Freddy Krueger movies are awesome then stick to those.  But if your on the next level and have seen it all then the Devils Experiment is for you.  There is a reason why they have not been released for over 17 years.  They are wrong, disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom, unless she is totally cool.  Good luck, enjoy and never stop living your life.",

		"A lot of people unfairly sh! t on this series but several of the Guinea Pig videos are fairly entertaining.  Devils Experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects worknot just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realisticespecially for the videos vintage and lowbudget.Let me start at the beginning now for those who do not know This film is an extreme torturefake snuff film that surfaced in Japan in the mid80s.  it stands simple A It is simple A This entails brutal violenceall effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girls arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound.The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground.  These two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings.The actress who plays the victim of the experiment is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera.  Her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling.  Some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest.  Also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels till she pukes.If you have not seen this series I hope I have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot. 8.510 for Devils Experiment.",

		"My rating refers to the first 4 Seasons of Stargate SG1 which are wonderfully fresh, creative and addicting.  When the cast stepped through the gate, you never knew what lay on the other side!  Starting around Season 5, the show took a different focus  still good, but different.The series follows the adventures of a team of humans and one alien who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the Stargate.  The backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie Stargate in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in Egypt.The episodes are light innocent and easy to watch and very creative.  Many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great scifi movies of their own.  What happens next was always unpredictable.The characters on which the show rests are also welldefined and brilliantly performed.  Their tone is serious, but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor.  They are simply fun to watch.Starting somewhere around Season 5, the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe the Goauld, then the Ori.  The plots become more complex a lot more politicalstrategic oriented and interdependent.  The characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature.One thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes.  They are cannotmiss shows They exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasons.If you are a scifi fan, watch a few episodes of the first 4 Seasons and you will likely be hooked.  If you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides, you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to.",

		"House of Games is a flawlessly constructed film, and one of the few films I have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends.  I first saw it on video a few years back after reading Roger Eberts review, which proclaimed it the best film of 1987.  it is other films I had other films Boy, was I in for a surprise.  This was one of the smartest, most wellwritten movies I had ever seen.The screenplay is quite a piece of work, not only in terms of the plot which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out, but also in terms of character development.  On my second viewing, I began to realize that Mamets screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film, but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations.  The climax of the movie is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable.  It stems naturally from what we know about the characters, and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending.  The performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add enormously to the film.  I cannot picture any other actor besides Mantegna playing the role of Mike, and Crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset.  Their work, plus Mamets extraordinary screenplay, combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980s.  It is truly a mustsee.",

I cannot picture any other actor besides Mantegna playing the role of Mike, and Crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset.  Their work, plus Mamets extraordinary screenplay, combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980s.  It is truly a mustsee.",
		"House of Games is a flawlessly constructed film, and one of the few films I have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends.  I first saw it on video a few years back after reading Roger Eberts review, which proclaimed it the best film of 1987.  I had my doubts, mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year.  Boy, was I in for a surprise.  This was one of the smartest, most wellwritten movies I had ever seen.The screenplay is quite a piece of work, not only in terms of the plot which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out, but also in terms of character development.  On my second viewing, I began to realize that Mamets screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film, but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations.  The climax of the movie is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable.  It stems naturally from what we know about the characters, and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending.  The performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add enormously to the film.  Crouse plays criminal mindset Their work, plus Mamets extraordinary screenplay, combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980s.  It is truly a mustsee.",
		"Plenty has been written about Mamets The House of Games; most of it good.  it held much I I decided much I The films success and durability probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film; a good story and a good scam.  Mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us, the audience, and the mark simultaneously.  Then he explains the art of conning only to do it again, etc. all the while building the story.  The House of Games, now a freebie on cable, is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for Mamet fans.  B",

		"This typical Mamet film delivers a quiet, evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man Joe Mantegna good.  Explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist Lindsay Crouse, it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences.  The cast includes a number of the players found is several of Mamets films Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H.  they do good job I loved Lindsay Crouse in this film, and have often wondered why she did not become a more noted player than she has become.  Perhaps I am not looking in the right places! The movie proceeds at a slow pace, with flat dialog, yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bangup ending.  You would expect a real let down at the ending, but I found it uplifting and satisfying.  I love this movie!",

You watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances.  Still, they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous.There is a lot going on between Carter and ONeill under the surface.  They manage to keep the lid on, but often just barely.  The episode Solitudes in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television.  The love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together.Carter and Jackson often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by ONeill.  Yet ONeills tactical instincts always seem sound.  He understands what to do without having to think about the matter.  The team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders.The quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10.  The original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest.  Ben Browder was far inferior to RDA in carrying the show.  He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all.  Amanda Tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons.  You could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby.  She was probably thinking more about the child than the show.The spinoff Stargate Atlantis has a few moments, but is mostly a weaker effort.  The major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original.  The villains Wraiths are so improbable as to be ludicrous.  Maybe Amanda Tapping can breathe some life into the program or it will not last beyond the fourth season.There has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show.  To have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in SciFi.  The use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad.  The campy use of decor from ancient Egypt concealing ultramodern technology is just as hard to accept.I wondered about some of the continuity on the show too.  In the season 2 opener, Daniel Jackson is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded.  He crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet.  The episode Hathor has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the SGC, yet it is never mentioned again.  This device could have been used in several later episodes on Daniel, ONeill, and Dr.  Frasier.",

		"I am big fan I am big fan In short, it is an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels, and never truly revealing what is happening, while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you have just seen.  The film cons the audience on many occasions, and despite us knowing this; it is still difficult to guess where it is going, and every twist comes off as a surprise.  As mentioned, I am a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler.  She then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient, and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con.House of Games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout, and David Mamet does well in establishing his films setting in the underground levels of the city.  The film is well acted also, with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill.  Joe Mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film, and although his performance is a little under wrought, he is always solid and believable as the villain of the piece.  Lindsay Crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work, and again is believable in her role.  She may not be the greatest looker, but at least she can act.  The way that the film executes it is plot is the main star of the show, however, and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer.  At times it is almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film.  Another thing that is great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons, which is useful if you are interested in making twenty bucks, say.  All in all, House of Games is a truly first rate thrill ride.",

		"House Of Games is definitely not without its flaws plot holes, stiff acting, final scenes but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head.  House Of Games does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do.  Of course, this is not a huge feat given the fact that we are dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate.  So it stands to reason that we never really know what is going on, even though we think that we do.  But that is what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game; a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities.It has a definite Hitchcock slant to it.  The film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort Marnie, considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the Masters more thoughtprovoking works.  One could easily consider the idea of Lindsay Crouses character being the same as Tippi Hedrins...ten year later perhaps.  Both are strongwilled loners, both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool.  Crouses repressed uptight character Put your Reality Check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks!",

To reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and House of Games may very well be the best con movie I have seen.  David Mamet wrote and directed this gem that is full of snappy dialogue, great oneliners, and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end.  Crouse is sly conman And with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie, the film is in utter control of it is audience; and we are loving the con. out of ",

It just means they are a letdown if you have gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons.After you have finished this series, be sure to watch the spin off series, Stargate Atlantis.  It is a worthy successor to this brilliant series.EDIT on 71808 I just found out that Don S.  Davis died few weeks It is a great loss.",
		"I am not great at writing reviews, so I will just spout my opinions...I loved this series at first.  The adventure, the action, the comedy, the drama...  I thought it was all brilliant.  Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis...  I loved them all.  Davis, it seemed, was the fifthmost important person in the cast.  Not a big deal.  But when his character General Hammond left at the end of the seventh season, and Andersons character Colonel ONeill moved from the field to the office, the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff.  I do not know whether it is because Hammond was more important that I realized or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series turned to .The first seven seasons, though, were awesome.

		"House of Games is spell binding.  It is perfect tens There are few movies I have seen that can grip you so quickly.  From the opening scene this movie just gets you.I am trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a FEW SPOILERS SO Do not READ ANYMORE IF YOU Do not WANT TO KNOW.I would say House of Games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists I have ever seenbar none.  From the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed.Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection, from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately.  Joe Mantegna was also wonderful.  The dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices.  I also loved the way the movie was filmed, in that grainy, surreal type of way, it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was.There were a few movies I have seen and loved that this reminded me of including The Grifters and The usual Suspects but really, House of games is completely different in it is way.  Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbing characters I have seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet, but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying.  You know somethings going to happen but you have no idea what.  And just when you think you have guessed what the something is, you realize you have not even scratched the surface....House of Games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature.  The character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well.  As the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters, we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it.  It is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it is conclusion.In closing, I would rank this 10 of 10, call it although not my absolute favorite film, pretty high on the list, most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best twists I have ever seen as well.  Although I love all types and genres of movies, when it comes to movies of the human psyche, it really does not get much better then this.  See this movie.",

		"Heres my first David Mamet directed film.  Fitting, since it was his first, as well.  it moves big cons It is like The Grifters, but without that films level of acting.  In that film, John Cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character.  The acting here is very flat I sometimes wondered if the bland acting by Crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis.  At least in the beginning.  It never gets really good, but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes.  Early in the film, some of Lindsay Crouses lines  the way she reads them  sound as if they are inner monologue or narration, which they are not.  With the arrival of Mantegna things pick up.The dialogue here is not as fun as it should be.  I was expecting crackerjack ringadingding lines that roll off the tongue, but these ones do not.  It all sounds very read, rather than spoken.  Maybe Mamet evolved after this film and loosened up, but if not, then maybe he should let others direct his words.  He is far too precious with them here and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality.  What is more strange is that other than this, the film does not look or feel like a play.  The camera is very cinematic.  My only problem with Glengarry Glen Ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre, but in that film the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free.  Everything flowed.I would not mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines  or even play characters speaking play lines  but here it sounds like movie or even book characters speaking play lines.  It is a weird jumble of theatre and film that just does not work.  That does not mean the movie is bad  it is not, it is often extremely entertaining.  The best chunk is in the middle.It is standard con movie stuff the new guy in this case, girl Margaret Ford Lindsay Crouse gets involved in the seedy con underworld.  How she gets involved is she is a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler.  She wants to help him out with his gambling debt, so she walks into The House of Games, a dingy game room where con men work in a back room.  I will admit the setup is pretty improbable.  Were they just expecting Crouse to come in?  Were they expecting she would write a cheque?  Was Billy in on it?  One of these questions is definitely answered by the end, however.And from here the cons are start to roll out.  I found the beginning ones  the little learner ones  to be the most fun.  We are getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as Crouse is.  We see the ending coming, and then we did not see the second ending coming, and then the real ending I did not see coming but maybe you did.  The ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second Crouse walked into The House of Games she found her true calling.I am going to forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange linereading because there are many good things here.  If the first part of the movie seems stagy, stick with it.  After the halfhour mark it does really get a momentum going.  If you want a fun con movie, then here she is.

Were they just expecting Crouse to come in?  Were they expecting she would write a cheque?  Was Billy in on it?  One of these questions is definitely answered by the end, however.And from here the cons are start to roll out.  I found the beginning ones  the little learner ones  to be the most fun.  We are getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as Crouse is.  We see the ending coming, and then we did not see the second ending coming, and then the real ending I did not see coming but maybe you did.  The ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second Crouse walked into The House of Games she found her true calling.I am going to forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange linereading because there are many good things here.  If the first part of the movie seems stagy, stick with it.  After the halfhour mark it does really get a momentum going.  If you want a fun con movie, then here she is.  If you want Mamet, go watch Glengarry Glen Ross again  James Foley did him better.",
		"Heres my first David Mamet directed film.  Fitting, since it was his first, as well.  The story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie, from the little cons to the big cons to the allencompassing con.  It is like The Grifters, but without that films level of acting.  In that film, John Cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character.  The acting here is very flat I sometimes wondered if the bland acting by Crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis.  At least in the beginning.  It never gets really good, but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes.  Early in the film, some of Lindsay Crouses lines  the way she reads them  sound as if they are inner monologue or narration, which they are not.  With the arrival of Mantegna things pick up.The dialogue here is not as fun as it should be.  I was expecting crackerjack ringadingding lines that roll off the tongue, but these ones do not.  It all sounds very read, rather than spoken.  Maybe Mamet evolved after this film and loosened up, but if not, then maybe he should let others direct his words.  He is far too precious with them here and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality.  What is more strange is that other than this, the film does not look or feel like a play.  The camera is very cinematic.  My only problem with Glengarry Glen Ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre, but in that film the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free.  Everything flowed.I would not mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines  or even play characters speaking play lines  but here it sounds like movie or even book characters speaking play lines.  It is a weird jumble of theatre and film that just does not work.  That does not mean the movie is bad  it is not, it is often extremely entertaining.  The best chunk is in the middle.It is standard con movie stuff the new guy in this case, girl Margaret Ford Lindsay Crouse gets involved in the seedy con underworld.

To say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming.  Just like a clever con artist, this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance.The story is taut and wellcrafted, the dialogue smart and laconic, the acting uniformly good Mantegna is superbly charismatic.  Some have complained that Dr.  Ford is not a very sympathetic character, and wondered why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse look so physically unattractive.  But Dr.  Ford is supposed to be cold and aloof; moreover, her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot at one point, I believe that an injury to her sexual selfesteem is a key part of her motivation ...  I will say no more.House of Games is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity.

		"House of Games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels.  It is shocking thriller It is blessed with marvelous performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna, and a strong, strong cast of supporting players, and it introduces Ricky Jay, card sharp extraordinaire, prestidigitator and historian of magic.  Its dialogue, written by David Mamet, is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie in which reality is often in question an extra dimension of unrealness.On the face of it, House of Games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men, diametrically different from The Sting, which was played merely for glamour and yuks.  At this level it does succeed admirably.However, you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization.  The only movie I know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated Private Benjamin.  That thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus, hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of Goldie Hawn to chase after some easy laughs.  House of Games sticks to its business.  As Poe once said of a good short story, it drives relentlessly to its conclusion.There is another strain of moviesaboutwomen, epitomized by Thelma and Louise, a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed, whether or not they realize their inner strengths.  What tripe.As usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater.  It should be a natural for film festivals.  Nominate it for one near you if you get the chance.I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23 year old daughter.  Better she should see it on a TV than not at all.",

		"it is psychological thriller It stars Lindsay Crouse as bestselling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide.  In doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels downtown to visit the lowlife place, House of Games.The gambler Mike played excellently by Joe Mantegna turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty.  He offers Crouses character a deal, if she is willing to sit with him at a game, a big money game in the backroom, he will cancel the patients debts.  The card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work gaining the trust of others and a fascinating relationship begins.  What makes House of Games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control, is it the psychiatrist or the conman or is it the wellknown man of great bluffs David Mamet.In House of Games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring, however in every David Mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings, not the direction.  In House of Games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads showy and distracting but mainly as is the case with much of Mamets work, it is the dialogue, which grips you and slowly draws you into the film.  No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words.  Everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order.  This is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension.  House of Games can also be viewed as a classwar division movie.  With Lindsay Crouse we have the middleclass, welltodo educated psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite, the working class of America earning a living by honest crime.The film seduces the viewer much like Crouse is seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema.  And the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for, it is stunning.An extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings. 910",

No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words.  Everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order.  This is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension.  House of Games can also be viewed as a classwar division movie.  With Lindsay Crouse we have the middleclass, welltodo educated psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite, the working class of America earning a living by honest crime.The film seduces the viewer much like Crouse is seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema.  it is enjoyable film",
		"David Mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with House of Games, a character study fraught with psychological overtones, in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game.  Margaret Ford Lindsay Crouse has a successful practice and has written a bestselling novel, Driven.  Still, she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life; there is an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve, and it primes her vulnerability.  he owes big money This takes her to the House of Games, a seedy little dive where she meets Mike Joe Mantegna, a charismatic conman who wastes no time before enticing her into his world.  Instead of the twentyfive large that Billy claimed he owed, Mike shows her his book, and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars.  And Mike agrees to wipe the slate clean, if she will agree to do him one simple favor, which involves a card game he has going on in the back room.  In the middle of a big hand, Mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes; while he is gone, her job is to watch for the tell of one of the other players.  By this time, not only Margaret, but the audience, as well, is hooked.  The dialogue, and Mamets unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines, is mesmerizing.  As Mike leads Margaret through his compelling, surreal realm of existence, and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game, we are swept right along with her.  From that first memorable encounter, when he demonstrates what a tell is and how it works, to the lessons of the short con, to the stunning climax of this film, Mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless.  And nothing is what it seems.  In the end, Margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature, and about herself.  She changes; and whether or not it is for the better is open to speculation.  Mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows, and does.  Crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here; you feel the rigid, uptight turmoil roiling beneath that calm, selfassured exterior, and when her experiences with Mike induce the change in her, she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated.  She makes you believe that she is capable of what she does, and makes you understand it, as well.  The dynamic supporting cast includes Mike Nussbaum Joey, Lilia Skala Dr.  Littauer, J.T.  Walsh The Businessman, Ricky Jay George and William H.  Macy Sergeant Moran.  House of Games is the quintessential Mamet; he is written and directed a number of highcaliber plays and films since, and will no doubt grace us with more in the future.  But this film will be the one that defines him; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up.  You will find it under Perfection.  This is one great movie you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 1010.",

		"This is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for.  If you watch T.V., then you might as well not watch the movie.  Almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews, except one which just happens to be Jennifer Annisten being the funny one.  It is typical Jim It is typical Jim Just do not go see this movie expecting to be surprised.  All in all, if you like Jim Carrey or comedies this is a mustsee, otherwise just watch the previews and you will be just as satisfied.",
		"u are fanatic u you saw average person you do amazing seasons I have amazing seasons I have to admit that I would never have gone into Sci fi if it was not for stargate, and my dad, who actually got me into sci fi when i was like 6, and i am glad he did, other wise i would not have seen the brilliant shows like SG1, which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies, basically if a new sci fi series is not better or as good as SG1, its not worth watching. basically this is the best sci fi show to date, and if you do not watch this, then you have no idea what you are missing!",
		"I have to say, from the beginning, when i watched the Stargate movie movie i was not blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie, with a lot of POTENTIAL, though the movie was not as, erm, amazing as other sci fi movies such as Star wars or aliens, which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing, even though i am not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people, i do not remember one line from either of those movies, i am not a big fan of wearing star wars T shirts, in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you, ah getting slightly off the point here, well my point is that the that you do not have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series, which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end, in 2006.though i did not like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997, and let me tell you, the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series, the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects, were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today.  he did brilliant shows I have glad he",

		"After a slow beginning, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny film that had something positive to say.  It was not one of Jim Carreys best performances, but he was still OK.  Morgan Freeman was just right as God.  Jennifer Aniston had some good moments.  I miss Steve Correll on THE DAILY SHOW! I like director Tom Shadyacs choices of movies.  He also did LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS, and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR.  In all three of those and in Bruce Almighty, he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him.  it is biblical references he gets biblical references I only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie.  My guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references, but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people.  That is too bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity.My Grade7 out of 10",

None of the other reviews have really gone into how cheesy it gets towards the end, I dont know what the writers were thinking.  Somehow I could not help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at recreating Liar Liar.On a positive note, The Daily Show is Steve Correl is HILARIOUS and so is the rest of the cast.

Jim Carreys illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 White House playoffs.  Almighty then!  These grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers Carrey included would possess the powers of God.

However, my premier kudos goes to Director Tom Shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for 2, and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time!

		"Bruce Almighty will sweep the Academy Awards with a record 14 Oscar wins!  It will surpass Titanic as the highest grossing film of all time!  Jim Carreys illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 White House playoffs.  Almighty then!  These grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers Carrey included would possess the powers of God.  That very same premise is the paramount ingredient in Carreys new laugh riot Bruce Almighty.  Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds God to total culpability for his own contretemps.  God, heavenly played by Morgan Freeman, grants Bruce the Gift of Godhis powers in order to challenge him if he can do Gods job any better.  Obviously, Bruce gets carreyed away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly.  Carrey is comedic form Jennifer Aniston was not mis.pittiful as Bruces girlfriend.

		"Fairly funny Jim Carrey vehicle that has him as a News reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and wrecks havoc.  Carrey is good time Carrey is good time The story is predictible to the extreme but the cast including Morgan Freeman as God is great and makes the film worth catching.  GRADE B",
		"Well not actually.  This movie is very entertaining though.  Went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the I think there might be something in my eye routine.  The movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance.  Jim Carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides.  In fact all the characters are great.  I am easy grader Thats all from BigV over and out!",
		"I for one was glad to see Jim Carrey in a film where being over the top was not the goal.  His character is like all of us.  Wanting more  better things to happen to us and expecting God to deliver.Morgan Freeman made a great God.  written.I think funny scenes it was funny scenes itself.I thought funny scenes This is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart.A funny film.",
		"I am big Jim I laughed my ASS off during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura.  I also like him in his serious movies, especially Truman Show.  This one is a cross between his VERY funny side, and his serious side.  He is of course VERY funny in this movie, but there are parts that are very serious, and he pulls it off with a lot of ease. he is truely a multifunction actor.As for the rest of the cast, I was happy with Jennifer Anistons acting.  I think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass.  Morgan Freeman makes a VERY cool God.  As for Steven Carell, his limited scenes are VERY funny, especially in the anchor scene.Overall, I would have to rate this a 9.  Good acting, funny script, and some very serious situations make this a very good film.",

		"Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life.  God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways.  Of course, giving someone Gods powers could take a turn for the worse.  Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is firstrate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well.  The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carreys facial expressions.  I liked black man I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman.  There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 67 out of 10",

		"Bruce Almighty looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers.  Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more.  Bruce Jim Carrey is angry at God and is given divine powers by him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job.  it is usual type Although crude at times, the film does have quite a few laughs, from Bruce parting his soup in half like the Red Sea and the customers reactions to him, as well as Freemans seemingly laidback and wisecracking image of God.  It is overly exaggerated at times, and there is some crude humor, but overall it manages to be somewhat funny.  There is a decent supporting cast, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell, which always helps.  The end of the film proves to be very romantic and tearjerking, and the message is clear, that we should do what God has called us to do and be the miracle.  The film is far from perfect, but still enjoyable, and far better than I and many people probably would have expected, especially if we see the deeper message of the film. out of ",

		"As someone who lives near Buffalo, New York, this movie scored points with me before I even saw it, since the story is based here.  There are even some bit parts with reallife newsTV anchor people from Buffalo..and, for once, it does not knock the area.  Hallelujah! Theologywise, puhleeze!!!  God is liberal side Being the lightweight comedy it is, it is nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes.  There are some laughoutloud slapstick comedy scenes and, hopefully, audiences  from Christians to atheists. got something out of this besides a few laughs, such as what prayer should really be all about.  Kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good message.Overall, it is a goodhearted film that should offend very few.",
		"I really do not know what people have against this film, but it is definitely one of my favourites.  It is not preachy, it is not anchored by it is moral, it should not be controversial.  It is just God.  Any possible God, no matter the religion.  And it is really funny.Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news, desperate to prove himself more or less TO himself that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job.  This drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend Grace Jennifer Aniston away.  When the final straws are executed, he is quick to not laugh, but yell in the face of God, who in turn gives Bruce his powers.  Bruce then makes his life better for himself, until he is guilted into helping others, where he then continues to miss the point of his powers.  Meanwhile, his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish, leaving his relationship on dangerous ground.OK, that was kinda long.  But as a plot, it works well.  The stepbystep fashion in which we meet the challenges of being God is much better than clustering his problems together, and is able to hide itself fairly well.As you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place, Carreys pitchperfect acting stays in character which, luckily enough, is him, and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene.  Whether they would admit it or not, the role was written or rewritten exclusively for Carrey.  humour is half execution And the humour is very good in the first place.  But without Carrey, it would kinda feel like a It is a Wonderful Life wannabe.Jennifer Aniston is great and, no matter what some may say, does not act like the only excuse for the third act.  At least, you do not think that when you see her.  She gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you are watching a movie, she and Carrey feel very much like a real couple.The movie feels ggooooodd see the movie to understand, has a very nice feeling, tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save Carreys career which was not goin anywhere..",

Aniston carried frustrated girlfriend Carrey was frustrated girlfriend I, for one, do not consider her to be either ugly or untalented.  I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history.

Well written and even better played out, this comedy will go down as one of this funnymans best.",

Bruce Almighty is a bit more mainstream, but you have been warned.If you are not sure, watch the trailer.

God takes up the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better.  Carrey gets into the swing of having all of Gods powers by making his girlfriend Jennifer Anistons breasts bigger, getting himself promoted, and answering everyones prayers by single stroke computer commands.This is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable, but it is very well made within it is very limited intent, provides almost continuous laughs to Carrey fans, and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrowminded godsquadders and antigodsquadders.On the more thoughtful level, the film tempts us to speculate about Carreys own career  stuck in his comedy typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two Golden Globes.  His most accomplished straight role, the Man on the Moon, is less well known that his comedy romps  or The Truman Show on which the Academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing Carrey.",

		"I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best television scifi series made.  Both stand out in my mind because unlike early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters.  you look original STAR In many ways, you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring.  This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 with its giant battles that took up all of the final season and the other TREK shows, as there was more of a larger story that unified them.  This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with SG1.  The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form.  Sure, there were a few throwaway episodes that were not connected to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny.And speaking of funny, I loved that SG1 kept the mood light from time to time and was not so dreadfully serious.  In this way, I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5.  Jack ONeill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of Homer Simpsonit is really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons.To truly appreciate SG1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work.  This coherence gives the show exceptional staying power.  And, if you do not like SG1 after giving it a fair chance, then scifi is probably NOT the genre for you.",

		"I was first time I mean, what a conceptual NIGHTMARE.  Jim Carrey playing God?  Nothing is sacred anymore.Well, this movie is hardly sacred, but it also is not sacrilegious, at least not to any great extent.  Yes, Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while, but he is not God.  Confused?  I will give you the low down.Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life.  He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace Anniston, and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other, but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground.Then Bruce gets a shot at anchorman, only to have it underhandedly stolen by Evan Baxter.  Obviously not please, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired.Much complaining and griping about God later, Bruce gets a page.  After a while he gets tired of it calling, so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building heh.  There he meets God Freeman, who is the Boss, Electrician, and Janitor of the building.  I found this highly amusing.  God is the Boss, the Holy Spirit is the Electrician, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor.  Think about it.  Boss, obvious.  Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running.  Janitor, the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left.  BRILLIANT.Anyway, Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing God, he starts to believe a bit.  Wonder why.  Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies.Since this is Hollywood, Bruce obviously eventually smartens up, learns his lesson, and starts using his powers for the good of the world.  In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done, not Bruces.Since it is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite amusing, and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it.  The movie is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it is definitely a good attempt.  Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this movie.So, while far from perfect, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it.Bottom Line 3.5 out of 4 worth a view or two",

BRILLIANT.Anyway, Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing God, he starts to believe a bit.  Wonder why.  Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies.Since this is Hollywood, Bruce obviously eventually smartens up, learns his lesson, and starts using his powers for the good of the world.  In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done, not Bruces.Since it is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite amusing, and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it.  The movie is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it is definitely a good attempt.  Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this movie.So, while far from perfect, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it.Bottom Line 3.5 out of 4 worth a view or two",
		"Starring Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was really quite skeptical the first time I watched this movie.  I mean, what a conceptual NIGHTMARE.  Jim Carrey playing God?  Nothing is sacred anymore.Well, this movie is hardly sacred, but it also is not sacrilegious, at least not to any great extent.  Yes, Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while, but he is not God.  Confused?  I will give you the low down.Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life.  He lives beautiful girlfriend He lives beautiful girlfriend He lives shaky ground.Then Obviously not please, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired.Much complaining and griping about God later, Bruce gets a page.  After a while he gets tired of it calling, so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building heh.  There he meets God Freeman, who is the Boss, Electrician, and Janitor of the building.  I found this highly amusing.  God is the Boss, the Holy Spirit is the Electrician, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor.  Think about it.  Boss, obvious.

		"he played timid guy Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums and of course they have to be Mexican, obviously, his good will towards his fellow man backfires.  In that case, it was not too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but I like that the movie suggests that things like that should not be ignored.  I am reminded of the episode of Michael Moores brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay.  The results were not very promising, so it is nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example.Jim Carrey plays the part of Bruce Nolan, the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart.  Or even better, it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere a little metaphor that comes up when Bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film.  Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that is seeking to bake the worlds biggest cookie.  He is desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station, but he loses his cool on live TV when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague.  You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report.  Needless to say, he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film.Morgan Freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the Man himself, displaying a God whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through Freemans massive talent as an actor.  He is the kind of God who takes his job very seriously, but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life.  I love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day.  There are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in America who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans.One of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives, and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewers religion.  I, for example, tend to reject organized religion in all forms and I see God and Satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live.  But despite the fact that I do not believe that God exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time, I was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie.Jim Carreys movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he is come.  If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura both of which I loved, by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film, it is amazing how far he is come.  He has moved from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, and The Majestic easily one of his greatest films ever.  Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today.Jennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the sidesplitting Office Space as Bruces girlfriend, who becomes increasingly exasperated by Bruces growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him.  There is definitely some lowbrow comedy in the film that does not really fit with the importance of the films meaning or the quality of the delivery, such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene, but it was definitely pretty nice to see Ace Venturas friend Spike make a cameo appearance.  As Stephen King very well knows, it is always nice to see familiar characters.  It is almost like seeing family again.Bruce is endowed with the powers of God for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better, and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him.  The thing I love about this is that, like I said before, religion is absent from my life, but I was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things I would have done had I been endowed with such powers.  The movie allows us to learn vicariously this way, which empowers the message even more.The scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film, such as the scene when Bruce loses his temper about the anchor position, the Jimmy Hoffa scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records, the scene where Bruces rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera, and my favorites, the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakerys cooking.  The movie has plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent jokes, such as when he says to God who reveals that he is the janitor, the proprietor, the electrician, etc that his Christmas parties must be real bashes, and to be careful about drinking, because on of him might need a ride home!  I also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes.  A little too true, and as Gallagher would add, behind every great man is also an amazed motherinlaw.Bruce Almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while, and is probably the only directly religious that I can remember seeing that I am anxious to buy on DVD to add to my personal collection.  It is a comedy written and performed in good taste, but with enough relatively lowbrow humor to keep the kids entertained.  This is a meaningful comedy for the whole family, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days.  In a world that is about to be flogged with yet another American Pie film AND another Scary Movie which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy, it is nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching.  Do not miss this one.",

It is almost like seeing family again.Bruce is endowed with the powers of God for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better, and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him.  The thing I love about this is that, like I said before, religion is absent from my life, but I was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things I would have done had I been endowed with such powers.  The movie allows us to learn vicariously this way, which empowers the message even more.The scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film, such as the scene when Bruce loses his temper about the anchor position, the Jimmy Hoffa scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records, the scene where Bruces rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera, and my favorites, the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakerys cooking.  The movie has plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent jokes, such as when he says to God who reveals that he is the janitor, the proprietor, the electrician, etc that his Christmas parties must be real bashes, and to be careful about drinking, because on of him might need a ride home!  I also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes.  A little too true, and as Gallagher would add, behind every great man is also an amazed motherinlaw.Bruce Almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while, and is probably the only directly religious that I can remember seeing that I am anxious to buy on DVD to add to my personal collection.  It is a comedy written and performed in good taste, but with enough relatively lowbrow humor to keep the kids entertained.  This is a meaningful comedy for the whole family, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days.  In a world that is about to be flogged with yet another American Pie film AND another Scary Movie which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy, it is nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching.

		"Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck.  Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums and of course they have to be Mexican, obviously, his good will towards his fellow man backfires.  In that case, it was not too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but I like that the movie suggests that things like that should not be ignored.  I am reminded of the episode of Michael Moores brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay.  The results were not very promising, so it is nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example.Jim Carrey plays the part of Bruce Nolan, the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart.  Or even better, it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere a little metaphor that comes up when Bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film.  Bruce is local bakery He is desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station, but he loses his cool on live TV when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague.  You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report.  Needless to say, he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film.Morgan Freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the Man himself, displaying a God whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through Freemans massive talent as an actor.  He is the kind of God who takes his job very seriously, but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life.  I love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day.  There are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in America who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans.One of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives, and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewers religion.  I, for example, tend to reject organized religion in all forms and I see God and Satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live.  But despite the fact that I do not believe that God exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time, I was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie.Jim Carreys movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he is come.  If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura both of which I loved, by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film, it is amazing how far he is come.  He has moved from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, and The Majestic easily one of his greatest films ever.  Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today.Jennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the sidesplitting Office Space as Bruces girlfriend, who becomes increasingly exasperated by Bruces growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him.

Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that is seeking to bake the worlds biggest cookie.  He is desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station, but he loses his cool on live TV when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague.  You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report.  Needless to say, he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film.Morgan Freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the Man himself, displaying a God whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through Freemans massive talent as an actor.  He is the kind of God who takes his job very seriously, but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life.  I love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day.  There are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in America who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans.One of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives, and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewers religion.  I see different aspects But despite the fact that I do not believe that God exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time, I was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie.Jim Carreys movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he is come.  If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura both of which I loved, by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film, it is amazing how far he is come.  He has moved from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, and The Majestic easily one of his greatest films ever.  Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today.Jennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the sidesplitting Office Space as Bruces girlfriend, who becomes increasingly exasperated by Bruces growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him.  There is definitely some lowbrow comedy in the film that does not really fit with the importance of the films meaning or the quality of the delivery, such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene, but it was definitely pretty nice to see Ace Venturas friend Spike make a cameo appearance.  As Stephen King very well knows, it is always nice to see familiar characters.  It is almost like seeing family again.Bruce is endowed with the powers of God for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better, and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him.  The thing I love about this is that, like I said before, religion is absent from my life, but I was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things I would have done had I been endowed with such powers.  The movie allows us to learn vicariously this way, which empowers the message even more.The scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film, such as the scene when Bruce loses his temper about the anchor position, the Jimmy Hoffa scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records, the scene where Bruces rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera, and my favorites, the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakerys cooking.  The movie has plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent jokes, such as when he says to God who reveals that he is the janitor, the proprietor, the electrician, etc that his Christmas parties must be real bashes, and to be careful about drinking, because on of him might need a ride home!  I also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes.  A little too true, and as Gallagher would add, behind every great man is also an amazed motherinlaw.Bruce Almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while, and is probably the only directly religious that I can remember seeing that I am anxious to buy on DVD to add to my personal collection.  It is a comedy written and performed in good taste, but with enough relatively lowbrow humor to keep the kids entertained.  This is a meaningful comedy for the whole family, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days.  In a world that is about to be flogged with yet another American Pie film AND another Scary Movie which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy, it is nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching.

		"Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck.  Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums and of course they have to be Mexican, obviously, his good will towards his fellow man backfires.  In that case, it was not too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but I like that the movie suggests that things like that should not be ignored.  I am reminded of the episode of Michael Moores brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay.

		"Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck.  Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums and of course they have to be Mexican, obviously, his good will towards his fellow man backfires.  In that case, it was not too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but I like that the movie suggests that things like that should not be ignored.  I am reminded of the episode of Michael Moores brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay.  The results were not very promising, so it is nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example.Jim Carrey plays the part of Bruce Nolan, the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart.  Or even better, it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere a little metaphor that comes up when Bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film.  Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that is seeking to bake the worlds biggest cookie.  He is desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station, but he loses his cool on live TV when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague.  You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report.  Needless to say, he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film.Morgan Freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the Man himself, displaying a God whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through Freemans massive talent as an actor.  He is the kind of God who takes his job very seriously, but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life.  I love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day.  There are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in America who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans.One of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives, and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewers religion.  I, for example, tend to reject organized religion in all forms and I see God and Satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live.  But despite the fact that I do not believe that God exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time, I was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie.Jim Carreys movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he is come.  If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura both of which I loved, by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film, it is amazing how far he is come.  He has moved from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, and The Majestic easily one of his greatest films ever.  Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today.Jennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the sidesplitting Office Space as Bruces girlfriend, who becomes increasingly exasperated by Bruces growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him.  There is definitely some lowbrow comedy in the film that does not really fit with the importance of the films meaning or the quality of the delivery, such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene, but it was definitely pretty nice to see Ace Venturas friend Spike make a cameo appearance.

Sadly he was either lucky with Enter the Dragon or he is lost his touch because he is not that great of a director.  The only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of Ms.  Rothrock and Richard Norton.

I think the appeal is that no matter what they do, the lovers can never unite.  I remember I was not surprised by the Korean movie Il Mare later remade into The Lake House.

		"This a good episode of The New Twilight Zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories I note both of them are based on short stories.  they have huge TVlooking The kid is this story, Dickie Jordan David Mendenhall is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid, so is calm, even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades.  His parents Christopher Allport and Elizabeth Norment, on the other hand, say he should not have used his birthday wish on getting a good score, and while their reason includes that they believe he is capable and he should have no need to worry, it is pretty obvious they are worried.  I will not give anything away in the ending, but I will say this  there is a point where we get a glimpse of what is to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject that evening or another?  his parents ask Dickie whether he would prefer to watch TV all night.  By todays standards, we would be pleased he would say he would rather read and not just because there is nothing worth watching...but why would his family ask this?  The flavor of what is encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from Harrison Bergenon which I hear has not received a great adaptation to the screen.  I only wish they could have provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as The Obsolete Man was.  I found it to be better than the short story it was based on.  I have not read the one that A Message from Charity was based on, but would like to since it was interesting  a 16yearld boy, Peter Robert Duncan McNeill is suffering a fever from unclean water, that has always been common in his Massachusetts hometown...but he is able to see through the eyes of a young Puritan woman suffering the same type of fever, Charity Payne, Kerry Noonann who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him.  They both recover, especially since it is common for that to happen in 1985, but the connection does not go away.  Charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each others company, especially Peter, who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students, even at the college he is been staying in one place at.  Things take an unexpected turn, though, when Charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from England as a sign of bewitchment, added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever not so common in 1700.  The two try to learn a way to save her.  The ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching.  Both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times, through a lessonwarning that sounds like something Rod Sterling would have cooked up and entertainment, make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship, love, and wisdom do a great deal.  Probably 34 of this has no theme, but somehow I think it all would have been approved by Sterlings crew.",

Upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why.  it is sure he The boy then asks, puzzled again, why would not he?  It is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry, but their sons i.q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial.  A corker of a concluding scene!  A Message From Charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present.  Which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present.  A nice story with a heartwarming conclusion.",

		"You know bad ones Why?  To see their heroes in action one more time.  That is the way I feel about Doc Savage.  I am a major fanatic for the character, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming.  And the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation.  Then they decided to crib elements from a number of Doc adventures and throw them into this one movie, resulting in a somewhat disjointed film.  There is a lot of promise in here, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices the music, the camp elements, etc.  But the spirit of Doc is there, and that is what those of us familiar with Doc and his crew respond to.  So, in my longwinded way, what I am trying to say is that this is not a bad movie it is just not as good as it should have been.  And anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai, and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all.",
		"It has said that The Movies and Baseball both thrived during The Great Depression.  It appears occasional relief A temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is Baseball.Likewise, an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the Cinema.  The presence of a Radio in just about everyones house hold kept Depression Era America at once attuned to Worlds Events and provided many a Drama and especially Comedy Shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality.The literature of the time also flourished at all levels.  The juvenile reading habits helped to create the Comic Book as we know it, what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures.  But the Comic Book just did not magically appear, all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages, all by itself.  There were mediums that were ancestral to them.  Obviously,the Newspaper Comic Strip was one parent, providing the visualnarrative method of story telling.The other direct ancestor was the Pulp Magazine.  The inexpensive, prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going, though not necessarily serialized, tales.  The pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to Edgar Rice Borroughs TARZAN and Johnston McCulleys ZORRO.  The 1930s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like THE SHADOW, THE AVENGER, G8s BATTLE ACES and THE SPIDER,MASTER of MEN all found their way to the news stands, among many others.One other was DOC SAVAGE, a fullblooded super hero of the written story; the covers of the pulps had perhaps, the only picture of the hero.  Possessing extraordinary strength, super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect, Doc was the prototype Super Hero.He also assembled 5 of his former Army Buddies into a small, free lancing team of adventurers.  Each of them was an expert in a given field.  So we had a top rated Chemist, Lawyer, Construction Engineer, Electrical Engineer, GeologistArchaeologistPaleontologist, etc.The Doc Savage stories were very popular in the 1930s and 40s, and were published into the middle 50s.  Then they went into a hiatus for a good 1215 years.  Then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new container, the paperback book.  A fresh look to the cover art was introduced, featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular Doc, with a perpetually ripped shirt.The reintroduction proved to be highly successful, with the publication of a title a month and for a while more.  Soon, there was a rumor of a Doc Savage movie!  But when, by what Producer?  Well, the venerable Man of Bronze was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together.  It was veteran Stopaction Animator and Producer of top Special Effects films, Geoprge Pal, who did the film along with Warner Brothers.When DOC SAVAGE, MAN OF BRONZE arrived in the Movie Houses, it boasted of a well casted team of actors, albeit a largely No Name as far familiarity with the viewers.  With former Tarzan of TV,Ron Elys nearly perfect casting in the lead, up and coming Beauty of a Starlette, Pamela Hensley in the female lead and veteran character Paul Wexler as the villainous, Captain Seas; no other name would have been recognized.  And, just maybe that was a plus in this case.The story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going.  Use of narration, by Paul Frees, and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story.From the very start, there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured Camp humor as the Batman TV series.  Some really great looking early scenes involving Doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the Paul Frees narration and the unexpected, unlikely outcomes.  For Example, an experiment of Docs with a miniature rocketmissile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish, a small one at that.  The whole story unfolds like that, hitting the viewer with a little Camp every so often, as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously.  We are also puzzled about Mr.  George Pals being the Producerhis last.  He who had been so well known for Special Effects, surely a factor that could be put to good use in a scifi action setting of the Pulp Characters world.I can remember seeing it quite vividly.  Mrs.  Ryan Deanna was in the Hospital, just having given birth to our 2nd child, Michelle081475.  Our older girl, Jennifer, was visiting her Grandmother, so after visiting hours were over in the Maternity Ward, it was straight over to the old Marquette Theatre, 63rd  Kedzie, here in Chicago.Having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with Doc, I was sort of let down by the final product.  I could accept a little of this Camp business, but would not have objected if Mr.Pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat Dinosaurs and Volcanoes to give it all a little more PulpComicSerial type excitement.And yet, the cast, headedup by Mr.  Ely and the others, made the whole film likable, if not lovable.  The sets and locations were, as far as we can see, very much like those of a 30s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone.And maybe that is just what they were trying for with this DOC SAVAGE, MAN of BRONZE.",

Such as, how was the Stargate activated without a human computer?  Where did the Goauld Ras race come from?  How many are there?  The first episode has a retired Jack ONeill spelled with 2 Ls recalled to active duty by General George Hammond due to an attack by the shut down Stargate from Apophis, a powerful Goauld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman.  We meet first time We find out that Daniel got married on Abydos, and that there are hundreds of Gate addresses that they can dial.  Then Daniels wife gets captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen.  It continues in the second episode where General Hammond announces the formation of the SGC which includes nine teams, in which Jacks team will be SG1 which consists of Jack, Samantha and Daniel.  They go to Chulak, a Goauld homeworld to rescue Daniels wife and another one captured at Abydos named Skara.  They get captured, and just as Apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners, a Jaffa named Tealc, First Prime of Apophis, saves them and goes to Earth with them, where he is made part of SG1.  That was only the beginning of the adventure.  In the course of the show they have gone to the past and future, gotten transported to alternate realities, swapped bodies, grown old, met alien races which include a rebel alliance of Goauld called the Tokra, in which Samanthas Dad becomes a member, the Asgard, a cute little race in which we see Thor most often he is Jacks buddy,and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times.The show was recently canceled, but lasted ten seasons.  In season nine, a new enemy called the Ori came in flaunting brand new powers, new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the Stargate and its creators, the Ancients.  Season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters, Ben Browder as Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG1 and Claudia Black as Vala MalDoran, a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team.

		"he laughed right places Ron Ely is just right as Doc.  Cool, calm, almost always in controland with an occasional twinkle in his eye.  What more can one ask for?  I have never read a Doc Savage book, so I do not know if it is faithful to the source but I enjoyed the light tone and derringdo.  Many people have compared this movie to Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I do not think is fair.  The difference in budget is astoundingRaiders must have at least 10 times the budget.  Doc Savage does not have the extensive location work that Raiders has.  Special effects are also at a minimum but come on people, the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right.  The Sousa music is catchylove that theme song Every time I watch the film, I end up humming the theme for days.The best way to approach this film is to just RELAX and enjoy.  Highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and Doc chase the Indian sniper throughout the rooftops of New York and the VERY funny fight sequence between Doc and Captain Seas.  Not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib really!.  Overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day.  I give it 7 out of 10.Doc Savage, Doc Savage...thank the lord he is here!",

		"The problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the 60screated concept that comic books could only be done as camp i.e., the 60s Batman show for TV and movie.  Thus you have combat sequences with subtitles come on! , a cluelessly unromantic Doc Savage he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps, not an idiot, Monk Mayfair in a nightsheet a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights, and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a Herve Villechez posing for an Oscar statute.  they are booming Sousa It is fun, and when it stays serious it is a very accurate representation of the pulps.  Except for Monk, as has been mentioned before he is hugely muscled, not obese.  And Long Tom, who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude, not Paul Gleason with an inexplicable scarf.The Green Death sequences, for instance, are remarkably gruesome and not something I would recommend for children.  But they are very close to the feel of the pulps.  When the writers and producers get it right, they do get it right  I will give them that.But if the producers had done Doc with the loving care and scripting of, say, Reeves first two Superman movies, think what we might have had then.  I think the problem is the movies schizophrenic.  There is a definite sense of trying to do a 30s homage, but they are also trying to give in to the heroes must be camp attitude that Batman created.  One gets the impression there was a sober, pulpstyle first draft and then someone came in and said, Hey, let us make it funny  it worked with the Batman show 8 years ago! But Doc lives on, thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai.  If MacRauch as not doing a homage to Doc Savage in that movie, the man is truly demented.  So when the series actually gets on TV allegedly midseason in 9900, Doc Savage, updated to the 90s, will live once more.",

		"This is a VERY entertaining movie.  A few of the reviews that I have read on this forum have been written by people who, apparently, think that the film was an effort at serious drama.  It is enjoyable film IT WAS enjoyable film All of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us.  The fight sequences are lively, brisk and, above all, not gratuitous.  The socalled Green Death, utilized on a couple of occasions, is not, as I read in one review, gruesome.  A couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between Doc and Seas near the end of the film.  Hey, lighten up...  Again, I remind one and all that this is a fun film.  Each phase of this fight was captioned, which added to the fun aspect.  The actors were not trying to emulate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan.  This is NOT one of those martial arts films.  Ron Ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play Doc.  Another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the bad guy Seas is dealt with.  I promise you that if you do not try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value, you will spend 100 minutes in a most enjoyable manner.",

This film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre,and was way before it is time,it is not to be taken seriously, move over Austin Powers.  Ron Ely is a God.It is unfortunate that this film has not been released on DVD in the UK.  I do not think it should be remade and bastardised, like I said it is a classic,it cannot be done without Ron.like the Italian job without Minis and Michael Caine.  I give it 1010.",

Although a bit of a rarity, this film is well worth seeking out  it will repay the effort of your search tenfold.",
		"Given the title, this first followup to QUARTET 1948 obviously reduces the number of W.  Somerset Maugham stories which comprise the film.  The author still turns up to introduce the episodes, but there’s no epilogue this time around; by the way, while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to R.C.  Sheriff, here Maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation, as well as Noel Langley though it’s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison.  As can be expected, much of the crew of QUARTET has been retained for the second installment – though this also extends to at least three cast members, namely Naunton Wayne, Wilfrid HydeWhite and Felix Aylmer the last two had bit parts in the episode from QUARTET entitled “The Colonel’s Lady”.  While TRIO ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the runningtime, it’s still done with the utmost care, acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain. “The Verger” tells of a church sexton James Hayter – for which the story’s title is another word – who’s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest Michael Hordern simply because he’s illiterate.  Rather than rest on his laurels, despite his age, he not only takes a wife his landlady, played by Kathleen Harrison but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered – and, with business flourishing, this is developed into a whole chain.  The last scene, then, sees him pay a visit to bank manager Felix Aylmer who, not only is surprised to learn of Hayter’s lack of education, but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were – to which the wealthy and respected tobacconist replies, with some measure of irony, that he had the calling to be a verger!  The second episode, “Mr.  KnowAll”, is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man Nigel Patrick, British despite his foreignsounding name of Kelada, who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun.  he shares pretty wife During a fancydress party, however, the passengers decide to enact their revenge’ on Kelada by having one of them impersonate him a jest which he naturally doesn’t appreciate! ; still, it’s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character – told by Crawford that the necklace she’s wearing is an imitation, Wayne challenges Patrick to name its pricebut the latter realizes immediately that it’s the genuine article and that this would compromise Crawford’s position if he were to tell, so Kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer!  As can also be deduced from the title, “Sanatorium” deals with the myriad patients at such a place – run by Andre Morell; the protagonist is a new intern, Roland Culver, who wistfully observes the various goingson.  The narrative, in fact, highlights in particular three separate strands of plot – one humorous the feud’ between two aged Scots long resident at the sanatorium, played by Finlay Currie and John Laurie, one melodramatic the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient Raymond Huntley and longsuffering but devoted wife Betty Ann Davies and one bittersweet the romance between na?ve but charming Jean Simmons and dashing cad Michael Rennie which, in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that Morell has diagnosed Simmons as a lifer’ while Rennie only has a few years left to him, leads the couple to the altar.",

I love exquisite lace Roland Culver as Ashenden is very appealing, but never mind the soppy young lovers, it is Raymond Huntley as the man who resents his wifes health and independence who harrows our emotions.  He usually played comical, pompous types, but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive.  The China Seas great 30s film starring Gable and Harlow stole the plot from the Mr Know All episode and also nicked a story by Kipling.  I wish we saw more of Naunton Wayne as the jealous husband  though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a Mexican hat.  I love that posh bird who plays his wife, too.",

Whether the period is the 20s the first story, the present ie 1950 for the middle story, or the 1910s the last, costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created.  I love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium  exquisite lace overlaid by the finest Shetland shawls.  Roland Culver as Ashenden is very appealing, but never mind the soppy young lovers, it is Raymond Huntley as the man who resents his wifes health and independence who harrows our emotions.  He usually played comical, pompous types, but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive.  The China Seas great 30s film starring Gable and Harlow stole the plot from the Mr Know All episode and also nicked a story by Kipling.  I wish we saw more of Naunton Wayne as the jealous husband  though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a Mexican hat.  I love posh bird",
		"Trios vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable.  It was famous actors The performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch.Observation.  In film it is not necessary that source material be in alignment with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile.  Small morality storytelling is quaint or coy only in the eye of the beholderthankfully.  Story contentwell toldcan overcome it is time, subject or place.Ironically, there are quite a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or cutting edge mores of the present era.  Inserting small morality contentoccasionallymight provide a dimension lacking.",

		"Made after QUARTET was, TRIO continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by Maugham.  Here the three stories are THE VERGER, MR.  KNOWITALL, and SANITORIUM.  The first two are comic THE VERGER is like a prolonged joke, but one with a good payoff, and the last more serious as health issues are involved.  Again the author introduces the film and the stories.James Hayter, soon to have his signature role as Samuel Pickwick, is the hero in THE VERGER.  He holds small custodialtype He holds intellectual snob When he hears Hayter has no schooling he fires him.  Hayter has saved some money, so he tells his wife Kathleen Harrison he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop.  He has a good eye, and his store thrives.  Soon he has a whole chain of stores.  When his grandchild is christened by Hordern, the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his exVerger.  The payoff is when bank manager Felix Aylmer meets with Hayter about diversifying his investments.  I will leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting.According to Maugham he met a man like Max Kelada Nigel Patrick on a cruise.  In MR.  KNOWITALL Kelada is a splashy, friendly, and slightly overbearing type from the Middle East who is on a business trip regarding jewelry by steamship.  His stateroom mate is Mr.  Grey the ever quiet and proper Wilfred HydeWhite who is somewhat, silently disapproving of Max.  Max likes to enliven things, and soon is heavily involved in the ships entertainment.  At this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the nonMaugham story and film CHINA SEAS 1935, as Max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real.  I will not describe the way Max rises to the occasion.SANITORIUM is the longest segment.  Roland Culver plays Ashenden the fictional alterego of Maugham  a writer and one time spy as in Hitchcocks THE SECRET AGENT.  Here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health.  He finds a remarkable crew of people, including Jean Simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman, Finlay Currie as an irascible Scotsman, John Laurie as a second irascible Scotsman who is at war with Currie, Raymond Huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up, and Michael Rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness.  Culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions.

		"Wilhelm Grimm Alexander Knox stands trial for Nazi crimes.  Wilhelm speaks own defense The film ends after the court sums up....The film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand.  The story is mostly set in a small Polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of Anna Shirley Mills, who Wilhelm is accused of raping; the treatment of the Jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps; and the church service where Willie Grimm Richard Crane denounces his Nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend Janina Dorothy Morris, Marjas daughter, after she has been shot at a brothel.Throughout the film, Knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter, resentful and evil man.  Martha Hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and Henry Travers is also very good in his role as a priest.  This film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished.",
		"This was a wonderful little American propaganda film that is both highly creative AND openly discusses the Nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed.  I have Nazi atrocities.The they were Nazi atrocities.The In this fictitious world court, a Nazi leader is being tried for war crimes.  Wilhelm Grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal Grimms life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks.  At first, it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis.  However, after a while, it becomes very apparent that Grimm is just a sadistic monster.  These episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama.All in all, the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars secondtier actors.  There are many compelling scenes and performancesespecially the very prescient Jewish extermination scene towards the end that cannot help but bring you close to tears.  It was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some supercreative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first.  Overall, it is a mustsee for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film.FYIThis is not meant as a serious criticism of the film, but Hitler was referred to as that paper hanger.  This is a reference to the myth that Hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper.  This is in fact NOT truepreviously he would been a starving artist, homeless person and served well in the German army in WWI.  A horrible person, yes, but never a paper hanger!",

Alexander Knox,  Wilhelm GimmGorky Park returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town.  He was Polish people As the Hitler party grew to power Wilhelm Grimm desired to become a Nazi in order to return and punish this small Polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind.  Marsha Hunt,Marja Pacierkowski,Chloes Prayer, played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with Whilhelm Gimm.  There are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the Nazi destroyed peoples families and their entire lives.  The cattle cars are shown in this picture with Jewish people heading to the Nazi gas chambers.  If you have not seen this film, and like this subject matter, give it some of your time; this film is very down to earth for a 1944 film and a story you will not forget too quickly.",

I have few movies Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster.  He betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse.  The performance is one of the most chilling performances I have ever seen.  Since World War 2, actors who played Nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for Oscars.  I imagine that since this was made during the war, the Academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil.  But Knox puts in that kind of performancea man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer.  I still cannot get over it.Marsha Hunt, who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly, is cast against type in probably the best performance I have ever seen her give, too.  Maybe not Oscar worthy, but the best of her career.  Nothing against her; I have enjoyed her in those slight roles she often played.  But here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama.If you like human drama stories, or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis, I highly recommend this fine little film.",

		"Norman, Is That You?  was this is all third hand, so take it with a grain of salt adapted to an African American family from a Jewish one, when it made the transition off stage and onto screen.  Also, it was one of those movies originally filmed in video, so the prints from the theater cannot have been that great.  Still, performances by Redd Foxx and others were pretty good.  it reflected early 70s For that reason alone, it is pretty interesting if not a little hollywood.  Do not believe me?  Check out lines about curtains, etc.  Very stereotypical.  Not too deep.But... the movie really shines in a couple of areas.  There is a side splitting scene when Redd Foxx is trying to find his wife, who is run away with his brother !  to Ensenada in a souped up Pinto.  The phone conversation across the border is really memorable.  But... the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did histheir gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs.  To the best of my knowledge, this is the only time that routine was filmed.  And, it is a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version, I am told.  Still, it is vintage Madame, and should not be missed.  People are still stealing lines from Wayland; the man was truly gifted.  Enjoy the movie!",
		"I saw a trailer for this on Afro Promo, the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring AfricanAmericans.  It looked black man It would seem that Redd Foxxs RF wife has left him for his brother, who works with him at the store back in Phoenix.  He has taken the bus to visit his son Norman is Los Angeles.So as RF arrives, Norman, wearing nothing but powderblue bikini shorts, gets out of his waterbed to answer the door.  Trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake his lover, who steadfastly refuses to budge.  It was just to the point where I wrote WHY will not he wake up?  when suddenly he does, and me and my friends jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blueeyed, swirlhairdoed Garson, Normans white livein lover, who just had the most faaaaaabulous dream Garson is a flaming queen of a type that can ONLY be imagined as emerging from 1976 L.A.  He has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry, and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on Carol Brady from The Brady Bunch.Norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his fathers visit.  Garson goes to stay with Waylon Flowers, and Madam answers the phone when Norman calls.  So RF attempts to reach his wife in Mexico.  While he is on the phone, Garson comes in to pack his dress and RF confronts him.  With a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation but sounding more like we are about to hear a very special track by The Emotions, he realizes that his son is gay.His first impulse is I will kill him.  I will kill him.  Then RF goes on a long walk, wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have, such as maybe we toilet trained him too soon.  His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk, for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man.  Surprisingly, he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality.  This, it must be said, is about eight more books on homosexuality than MY parents bought.  He then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all!  RF then hires Audrey, a sixfoot Amazon prostitute in this amazing fur thing played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones.  He hired her for Norman to try out heterosexuality, but this pisses Norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend Melody.Then Garson comes over and offers to take RF out for the night.  He commiserates over the loss of RFs wife, and tells the tale of his own mother, who harbors an irrational prejudice against Pilippinos because she was molested at a luau.

		"I saw a trailer for this on Afro Promo, the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring AfricanAmericans.  It looked like what it is; a highly tendentious wacky comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay.  It would seem that Redd Foxxs RF wife has left him for his brother, who works with him at the store back in Phoenix.  He has taken the bus to visit his son Norman is Los Angeles.So as RF arrives, Norman, wearing nothing but powderblue bikini shorts, gets out of his waterbed to answer the door.  Trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake his lover, who steadfastly refuses to budge.  It was just to the point where I wrote WHY will not he wake up?  we are first glimpse Garson is flaming queen He has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry, and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on Carol Brady from The Brady Bunch.Norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his fathers visit.  Garson goes to stay with Waylon Flowers, and Madam answers the phone when Norman calls.  So RF attempts to reach his wife in Mexico.

With a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation but sounding more like we are about to hear a very special track by The Emotions, he realizes that his son is gay.His first impulse is I will kill him.  I will kill him.  Then RF goes on a long walk, wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have, such as maybe we toilet trained him too soon.  His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk, for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man.  Surprisingly, he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality.  This, it must be said, is about eight more books on homosexuality than MY parents bought.  He then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all!  RF then hires Audrey, a sixfoot Amazon prostitute in this amazing fur thing played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones.  He hired her for Norman to try out heterosexuality, but this pisses Norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend Melody.Then Garson comes over and offers to take RF out for the night.

		"I saw a trailer for this on Afro Promo, the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring AfricanAmericans.  It looked like what it is; a highly tendentious wacky comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay.  It would seem that Redd Foxxs RF wife has left him for his brother, who works with him at the store back in Phoenix.  He has taken the bus to visit his son Norman is Los Angeles.So as RF arrives, Norman, wearing nothing but powderblue bikini shorts, gets out of his waterbed to answer the door.  Trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake his lover, who steadfastly refuses to budge.  It was just to the point where I wrote WHY will not he wake up?  when suddenly he does, and me and my friends jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blueeyed, swirlhairdoed Garson, Normans white livein lover, who just had the most faaaaaabulous dream Garson is a flaming queen of a type that can ONLY be imagined as emerging from 1976 L.A.  He has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry, and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on Carol Brady from The Brady Bunch.Norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his fathers visit.  Garson goes to stay with Waylon Flowers, and Madam answers the phone when Norman calls.  So RF attempts to reach his wife in Mexico.  While he is on the phone, Garson comes in to pack his dress and RF confronts him.  With a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation but sounding more like we are about to hear a very special track by The Emotions, he realizes that his son is gay.His first impulse is I will kill him.  I will kill him.  Then RF goes on a long walk, wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have, such as maybe we toilet trained him too soon.  His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk, for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man.  Surprisingly, he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality.  This, it must be said, is about eight more books on homosexuality than MY parents bought.  He then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all!  RF then hires Audrey, a sixfoot Amazon prostitute in this amazing fur thing played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones.  He hired her for Norman to try out heterosexuality, but this pisses Norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend Melody.Then Garson comes over and offers to take RF out for the night.  He commiserates over the loss of RFs wife, and tells the tale of his own mother, who harbors an irrational prejudice against Pilippinos because she was molested at a luau.  They attend a long featured performance of Wayon and Madam, which culminates in Madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose.  Once more, mouths were agape.So it seems that, would not ya just know it, RF and Garson have a wonderful evening together!  You see gay world It is really JUST that simple!  This still does not prevent RF from yelling Rape!  when Garson wakes him from a bad dream.  It ends less predictably than you would think.There was so much that was just off.  WHAT is the basis of Norman and Garson s relationship?  They do not seem to have ANY rapport, and Norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking Garson out, and even when he comes around to stand up for himself, he never defends Garson or talks about their relationship.

It cannot all be blamed on Mr.  Bush  after all, we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even reelected him after his lies had been exposed.  Now, with complete justification, we Americans are reviled throughout the world.Today, we watch this film with a new awareness That the rise to power of Nazis in Germany was not due to a flaw in the German character, but, a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts.  I am not comparing George Bush to Adolph Hitler.  But, I am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror, hatred, and hypernationalism to do despicable things.Sadly, the blackmailer, who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement, no matter how immoral, is most like the leaders of our country, those who support them, and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand, that they cannot even be bothered to vote.A film like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be  a force for the betterment of humanity  and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals.Geoff",

Famous for being shot on videotape and transferred to film, an experiment at the time, NORMAN is a raucous politically incorrect closet slamming farce that The Farrelly Brothers should look at remaking today.  If they had made it in the first place there would be no complaints about its content and slant either.  It is very funny and YES very rude and hilariously all wrong.  Just as it should be.

He literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films as the other man and the best friend before coming into his own in films as an old man.  He was not lazy, but rather, a very hardworking actor who made it look easy who had a Broadway career simultaneously with his film career.  He just was not cast as a leading man in films or given very challenging roles under the studio system.  I challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in Hud and I Never Sang for my Father and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk.",

It is a long forgotten screwball comedy that Turner Classic Movies has begun to show.  Maltins movie book does not contain it.  In nearly every department, Amazing Mr.  Williams is firstrate police As the wedding bells are about to ring, he gets called to the scene of a murder.  The lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force.  There are a lot of laughs in the process.Melvyn Douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy.  Joan Blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight.  Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are hilarious.The film goes on a bit too long, but who cares?  The screwball comedies are always able to entertain, and this film belongs right in there with the best.",

		"Delightful minor film, juggling comedy and detective, romance and drama genres as nimbly as Lt Kenny Williams Melvyn Douglas balances his devotion to his girl Maxine Carroll Joan Blondell and his duty to the force as an ace detective.This hodgepodge may not appeal to all viewers today, but in its day, it had something to offer every member of the moviegoing family, and the resolution to the rather tired feelingversusduty plot is original and refreshing, and well worth the wait.  The Amazing Mr.  Williams contains blind dates Williams contains comic repartee Ludicrously frocked, Melvyn Douglas delivers some of the best lines I would walk down Main Street in a Turkish towel before I would let any woman control my life!  And the effervescent Joan Blondell lets her barbs fly with typical aplomb Good grief!  You look like my Aunt Nellie!  The crimesolving here is standard fare, although a fine cast of character actors helps bring the material to life.  From todays vantage point, The Amazing Mr.  Williams is perhaps most interesting for its insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construct, all the more malleable for its seemingly rigid boundaries.  While much of the gender commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes, at times it is both subtle and penetrating, playing out not only in some of the finer details of the film, but in the battle of genres that reaches its culmination in the final scene.",

		"This is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all.  Generally speaking, I am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories.  And this one is GREAT!  Besides Meryls performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise, the movies greatest asset is the story it is based on.  The riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture, after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eyeopening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans, and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society.  It is selfish dupes The other face of the socalled civilized society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings needless to say, this is very general, even though this specific tale unfolds in Australia, that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty.  Must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thoughtprovoking.",
		"I think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943, though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness.

In particular, the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just did not ring true.  It sounded more like antiFascism speeches than the voices of real children.

About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them though he had no discernible accent.It is really tough to believe that the ultrafamous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog, as it just does not sound true to life.  The story was based on the play by his lover, Lillian Hellman.  And, the basic story idea and plot is good,...but the dialog is just bad at times.

Australia is own baby I do not mean to spoil the story for you, but you need to know the basics before getting kneedeep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison.Buy or rent the movie and discover how deepseated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globe.This is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors.Both Meryl Streep with her famous Aussie accent and Sam Neill, whose accent is his nativeborn pronunciation, are outstanding.  Those with supporting roles are also quite good.You will remember this movie for many years.See it!",

		"I anticipated unremarkable film This assumption came from the fact that aside from Streeps Best Actress nomination, the movie received little attention from major awards groups.Little did I anticipate that A CRY IN THE DARK would be such a riveting drama, wellconstructed on every level.  If you ask me, this is an underappreciatted classic.The film opens rather slowly, letting the audience settle into the Chamberlains at a relaxed pace and really notice that, at the core, they are an incredibly loving, simple family.  Fred Schepisi the director selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy, while also showing the attentive bliss with which Lindy Streep and Michael Sam Neill Chamberlain care for their children.While the famous line A Dingo Took My Baby!  has become somewhat of a punchline these days, the movie never even comes close to laughable.  The actual death of Azaria is horrifyingly captured.  It is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience horrified and asking questions.The majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the Chamberlains continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court, which suspects Lindy of murder.The fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping.  As an audience member, I was fully invested in the Chamberlains plight... and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media.  But at the same, the mediapublic opinion is understandable.  I loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic, but they always had valid reasons to hold their views.The final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas.In terms of performances, the only ones that really matter in this film are those of Streep and Neill... and they deliver in every way.  For me, this ranks as one of if not 1 Meryl Streeps best performances.  For all her mastery of different accents which of course are very impressive in their own right, Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters.  I find this to be one of Streeps more subtle performances, and she hits it out of the park.  And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streeps performance.  From what I have seen, this is undoubtedly Neills finest work to date.  It is a shame he was not recognized by the Academy with a Leading Actor nomination to match Streeps... bc the two of them play of each other brilliantly.More emotionally gripping than most films, and also incredibly suspenseful...

		"Fascinating movie, based on a true story, about an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain Meryl Streep accused of killing her baby daughter.  She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is highly suspicious.  The film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case, the way Australians interpreted what was presented in the media, and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the womans conviction, based on barely any hard evidence.  I love hard look I have always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 Angry Men before they go through with their duties.  It is not, as has often been said, a liberal movie, but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge.  A Cry in the Dark is likewise clinical.  Schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic.  Some may find the film boring or dry, but I found it engaging.",

		"In August 1980 the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents Lindy and Michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation.  The media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood.  What followed was a gross miscarriage of justice.Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that while camping near Ayers Rock, central Australia, that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area.  Noone believed them.  Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and Michael as an accessory after the fact.  The whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing.  The Chamberlains trial was over before it began.Lindy never proved her innocence, so she was found guilty.  There was never enough evidence to convict her, yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure.  How could we as a nation even sit in judgement?  From where we are, how could we possibly presume to know?  Unless there was absolute proof, and no reasonable doubt whatsoever, the Chamberlains should have been acquitted.Fred Schepisis film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of John Brysons novel, that the Chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them.  That in fact a dingo did take baby Azaria on that fateful night at Ayers Rock.Schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation, hell bent on the truth being brought to light.  He shows unbecoming light His screenplay, cowritten with Robert Caswell, vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred.The outstanding Meryl Streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts.

What followed was little more than trial by media, and with the Australian people determined she be put away, Lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence.Meryl Streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles Australia head on to prove her innocence.  She is truly awesome, and the only thing that fails her is a true blue Aussie accent, though she does her level best to sound ocker.  You might wonder why a top Australian actress was not cast in the role, but star power is probably the answer.  Alongside Meryl is an equally impressive Sam Neill, outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes, while he feels powerless to do anything about it.

		"In August 1980 the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents Lindy and Michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation.  The media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood.  What followed was a gross miscarriage of justice.Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that while camping near Ayers Rock, central Australia, that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area.  Noone believed them.  Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby, and Michael as an accessory after the fact.  The whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing.  The Chamberlains trial was over before it began.Lindy never proved her innocence, so she was found guilty.  There was never enough evidence to convict her, yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure.  How could we as a nation even sit in judgement?  From where we are, how could we possibly presume to know?  Unless there was absolute proof, and no reasonable doubt whatsoever, the Chamberlains should have been acquitted.Fred Schepisis film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of John Brysons novel, that the Chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them.  That in fact a dingo did take baby Azaria on that fateful night at Ayers Rock.Schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation, hell bent on the truth being brought to light.  He shows Australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the Chamberlains pay!  His screenplay, cowritten with Robert Caswell, vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred.The outstanding Meryl Streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts.  She brings little Aussie Even her accent is almost, but not quite, spot on.  A very good effort by the master of that trade.

		"I found it hard to like anyone in this film.  The central characters, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, whose daughter disappears during a night out in the Australian outback, are not bad people, but then surely not all, or even most, of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better.  we are tragic disarray It is not a movie about the degenerate society of Australia in particular; it is merely an account of a true story that happened there.  Society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are.When a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigines dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog, when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines, newspapers and TV programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy, there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of ones own unaware perceptions, influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround ones life.  The reason I appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out, from the victims to the masses.The evidence against Lindy Chamberlain aside, suspicion was jetfueled mostly by a virtue of hers.  To the public eye, she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter.  Why was she able to keep her cool, even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up, for TV and the press?  How much of the downward spiral could have been prevented had she behaved more to the publics liking in the media?  Meryl Streep, one of, if not the, greatest actress working today, may not give a performance that particularly stands out, and frankly neither does any other actor, or department of filmmaking.  But she, and the screenwriters, do understand Lindy.  What is infuriating is that it is not that difficult.  Apparently, she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case.  Whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense, we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation.Whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as Sophies Choice, The Devil Wears Prada, Angels In America or other such work, it is a triumph.  It is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself.  She frustrates us because we do not know what she is thinking or feeling.  It took me awhile to feel endeared toward her, but this is the movies way of suggesting the reaction of the publics attention.She is married to a pastor, and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most.  Initially, they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to Gods will, kickstarting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughters death was some sort of ritual killing on their part.  Whatever happened to the little girl, her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the medias intake did not immediately identify, so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry...well...Meryl Streep and Sam Neill are constantly on screen, but the Australian public plays the real leads here.  Like punctuation for each plot advance, director Fred Schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office, where the public tries Lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections.This GolanGlobus docudrama is not particularly memorable.  The settings atmosphere does not give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out.  But it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public.",

		"it was interesting story I remember interesting story Several years later I see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie.  The story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself.  The cast just makes it that much more appealing.  Meryl Streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture.  She nails Mrs.  Chamberlains mannerisms, the accent, and even look.  She shows the pain, hurt, surprise, and anger that Lindy had to endure, and in the process it is hard to remember that it Is not Lindy.  In my opinion, this performance of Meryls was better than her Oscarwinning turn in Sophies Choice, and should have garnered her her third Oscar.  Sam Neill is perfect as Michael Chamberlain, and for some surprising reason, was not recognized by the Academy with at least a nomination.  In all, this movie only receive ONE Oscar nod Streeps for Best Actress.  However, it did receive several Australian Oscars and nominations.Definitely a toprate movie it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast.",

Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring.  Mrs.  Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was not particularly likable, nor all that smart.  But that just makes Streeps work all the more remarkable.  I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nominations.  About the film, well, there were a couple of interesting things.  I do big part I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday.  And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at miseryinducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues.  A pretty good film.  A bit different.  Grade B",

		"it was same year you pick same year The plot is engaging and interesting, and the pacing is fast, with this covering many situations, and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken.  Where this really stands out is the acting.  The performances are excellent.  Neill and Streep are both impeccable.  It is also cool to hear so much Australian spoken in a Hollywood film, and even those who do not come naturally to it at least attempt an accent.  The cinematography and editing are nice enough, but they do not really go beyond the standard stuff.  This movies story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling.  While I have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture, I understand that it is quite close to the truth.  There is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this.  It is, at times, a downright great courtroom drama.  I recommend this to any fellow fan of such. 710",

		"Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense.

It presents easy target.Lindy Being someone who spoke her mind, someone who did not play the sympathy card, and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal, she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she did not kill her own child.  The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece.  And through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as ever, even when her husband Michael was falling apart.This stance, of course, is the power of strength, as unsympathetic as it may look like, and people happen to react strongly to that.  They want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn, not sit there and look blank.  People do not understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations.  Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold, but not unfeeling woman, one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty.  Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair  someone has to, or the Chamberlains would be too detached, and no one wants to see that.

		"Spoilers Following I picked up the book Evil Angels when it first came out knowing nothing of the case.  Just to give the press and the Austrialian people a break here, I was quite far into it before I began to question the Chamberlains guilt.  The author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did.  John Bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors and picked up by the press of the arterial spray, the actelone ??  plates, Dr.  James Camerons certainty that the collar was cut with scissors, that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up, bloody hand print, etc. all quite convincingly.  After all, these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie, and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong was not apparent to me at all.  It was technical evidence To this point, beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials, hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human; people did not believe it was possible.  The public was suspicious of the Seventh Day Adventists, whose origins made them appear to be a cult, and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt.  Were it not for dedicated, selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony, finding Azarias clothes later would not have been enough to get Lindy out of jail.  The book shook me for that reason, and I have been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyones guilt ever since excepting OJ of course.  I was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and do not think it could have been done better.  I have always liked Sam, who I could identify with completely, and Meryl was perfect as always.  Beautiful photography, haunting music.  I think it is not only a very good, but a very important, movie.  Too bad it did not receive more publicity at the time it was released.",

As Seventh Day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day and soon have Azaria dedicated to God at their church, with their two older boys looking on.  Michael gets impressive tourist Not being wealthy, the family camps near the site.  After a wonderful first day, Lindy puts baby Azaria to sleep in one of the tents.  Suddenly, she hears Azaria crying.  As Lindy rushes to the tent, a dingo dog is just exiting, shaking his head.  The baby is gone and soon, so is the dingo.  Although the entire camp looks for the baby, she is not found.  Concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child, the Chamberlains struggle to accept Gods decision and go on with their lives.  But, unfortunately, the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that Lindy murdered the baby.  She is subsequently arrested and put on trial.  How could this happen?  This is a great depiction of real events that shows how mob rule is not a figment of the imagination.  The entire country turns against the Chamberlains, in part because they are seen as odd.  Streep gives her best performance ever as the complex Lindy, whose own strongwilled demeanor works against her every step of the way.  Neill, likewise, does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused Michael.  The cast is one of the largest ever, with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into Lindys case.  The costumes, scenery, script, direction and production are all top of the line.  If you have never seen or heard of this film, remedy that straight away.  It is not a far cry from reality to say that this Cry should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media.",

		"This is a true story of an Australian couple wha are charged with murder when their infant child disappears.  she plays likable.The media These reallife situations demonstrate that the media in fact can affect how a criminal case is handled.  I well remember the Cleveland Plain Dealer running a huge headline stating Why Is not Sam Sheppard in Jail?.  The prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure, and Sheppard was tried and convicted.  Only after years in jail was he exonerated.I love movies which tell a true story, do it in an interesting way, and make an important point in the process.  This is one of those movies.  Other good movies which tell the story of innocent persons charged with crimes include Hurricane, The Thin Blue Line, and Breaker Morant.  In particular, the latter is another Australian film which is highly recommended.810",

		"ROLL is little film Toby Malone plays an 18 year old kid very well acted, by the way who is into soccer.  Malones cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists and turns involving two gym bags, a drug lord, some tough bikers, some cops, and some prostitutes ... and the movie keeps us guessing as to which characters are on which side of the law, what the contents of either gym bag is, and even what gender a key biker is.  Parts of it reminded me of LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING Barrels.For me, ROLL reinforced three opinions that I already held before seeing ROLL.  Those opinions are 1.  I really want to visit Australia one day.  The country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a cool place for a vacation.2.  Some of the best filmmakers in the are Australian.

Malones cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists and turns involving two gym bags, a drug lord, some tough bikers, some cops, and some prostitutes ... and the movie keeps us guessing as to which characters are on which side of the law, what the contents of either gym bag is, and even what gender a key biker is.  Parts of it reminded me of LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING Barrels.For me, ROLL reinforced three opinions that I already held before seeing ROLL.  Those opinions are 1.  I really want to visit Australia one day.  it looks cool place Some of the best filmmakers in the are Australian.  The cinematography in ROLL was especially impressive.  I loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes.3.  Australian women are HOT!",

Mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening in before his big day.Having missed his cousin George Damien Robertson on arrival in the city, Mat encounters further trouble when a young biker takes him for a ride in more ways than one.Toby Malone, probably better known for his work in theatre, puts in a commendable performance as the bucolic teenager.  There are telltale signs of a low budget, but as with so many other lowbudget movies there is more fun, seemingly more spontaneity, and more charm, than there is to be seen in the average Hollywood blockbuster.",

		"I just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced 45 mins of ROLL.Roll is about a country boy, Mat Toby Malone who has dreams of becoming a Sports Star.  Mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by his cousin George Damien Robertson.  Well, that was the plan anyway.  George is involved with a gangster, Tiny John Batchelor and is making a delivery for him.  Needless to say, Mat gets dragged into Georges world.  I thought it was great how Mat teaches George some morals and respect while George teaches Mat how to relax and enjoy life a little.  Toby and Damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job.Every character in the movie complimented each other very well, the two cops were great.  David Ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie.  Tiny played other things It was good to see sights and landmarks that I grew up with, especially the old Ferris wheel.This Rocks n Rolls",

It was old Ferris",

Needless to say, Mat becomes enmeshed in the chaos, and it is not long before thoughts of tomorrows match are shunted to the back of his mind as the nights frantic events unravel.Accomplished Western Australian professional Shakespearean actor Toby Malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive countryboy Mat, and successfully plays a part well below his age.  Best support comes from John Batchelor as Tiny, and an entertaining role by David Ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events.  Roll is worthwhile use",
		"I have just watched Roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be.  itself is good mix There are plenty of good twists throughout as well, it will keep you guessing until the end.  Other characters to watch out for are the totally insane Tiny and the sneaky attractive Jesse.  It may not have the huge budget of a Hollywood blockbuster but do not let that put you off, you could do a lot worse than checking this out, you will not regret it.  Good Fun. 710",
		"A film I expected very little from, and only watched to pass a quiet hour  but what an hour it turned out to be.  Roll is little story Roll is big teams He is supported superbly by John Batchelor as local gangster Tiny.  Watch out for these two.Highly recommended.",

Roll is an excellent if nonetooserious little story of countryboylostinthebigcitymakesgood, it is funny throughout, the characters are endearing and the pace is just right.Toby Malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of Matt, said country boy and local Aussie Rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams.  He is local gangster Watch out for these two.Highly recommended.",
		"This film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments.  I loved the character of Matt, and also Tiny.  They seemed funny characters Matt is very good as is his no good cousin, and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy.  I must say I saw striking similarities between Matt and another Aussie actor, Eric Bana.  My personal favourite part was the brothel scene, loved that.  Overall, I liked the film and it will get about an 8 rating.  The penalty however, I was disappointed in.  It was a side foot curl, rather than the appropriate laces blast.I am of course kidding. ",

Buchanan holds that if those selfish Poles had not confronted the Nazis, drawing in foolishly meddling Britain and giddily altruistic France, no war would have engulfed the West.  He believes that without the rigors of Total War, no one in Germany would have built gas chambers to provide a Final Solution to the Jewish Problem.Some commenters on this site feel that Watch sags under the weight of stale propaganda.

		"The previous reviewer has said it exactly.  it was first airing I saw first airing I still remember some of the scenes.  The setting is the opening of the 20th century, the war referred to in the title is World War I.  One of the scenes was set in a womenonly section of a public place, which was an interesting historical note.  The moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my alltime great movie moments.  I do not think of this as a gay movie, it is an interesting and tender period love story, where the two principals happen to be women.  I would love to see this movie again; I would buy this one if it ever came out on DVD.",

Frances Lee McCain is superb in the role of career photographer and I have spent the next 30 odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail.There has to be a video of this movie?

But nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced, as I recall it, on a shortlived PBS series which showcased original screenplays by new and upandcoming playwrights.I watched it every time it was shown on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times.  I have New Year This wonderful film is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org.  My understanding is that the DVDs are burned from the writers own personal copy.",
		"It is refreshing my This was a very funny movie based on the classic series!  Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were hilarious together.  Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse run Moonshine in the General Lee.  When Boss Hogg forces the Dukes off their farm, Bo and Luke sneak around Hoggs local construction site and find samples of coal.  They soon realize that Boss Hogg is gonna stripmine Hazzard County, unless the Dukes can stop him, with the help of their beautiful cousin, Daisy.  My only two problems with the movie was that Burt Reynolds was not right for the part of Boss Hogg, and Sheriff Rosco P.  Coltrane was way too serious.  Other than that, I highly recommend THE DUKES OF HAZZARD!!!",
		"you were hot body Of course the film is not a masterpiece, i do not think it was aiming to be.  It was fun and funny, i never watched the show when i was younger, i only recently saw one episode, and when i watched the movie, i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere.  The movie seats were practically shaking, and the car sequences were good because it did not bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious. and jessica Simpson is plain hot, i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences.  All in all, i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on DVD.  People, enjoy it for what it is.",

		"Having read some of the other comments here I was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised.  REALITY CHECK The original series was not that good.  I think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and Daisy Dukes legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted.  The Duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks, the shrunken Boss Hog was too cretinous to be evil and Rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment.  it ran first series.Back it did first series.Back It is first series.Back If you watch this film in it is own right, not as a direct comparison to however you remember the TV series, then it is not bad at all.  The real star is of course the General Lee.  The car chases and stunts are excellent and that is really what D.O.H. is all about.  Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with Seann William Scott as Cousin Bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious DumbAndDumber sort of way the TV series never achieved.  The lovely Jessica Simpson is a natch as Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds makes a much improved Boss Hog and M.C.  Gainey makes a believably nasty Rosco P.  Coltrane, the way he always should have been.If you do not like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you would not be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect.  Otherwise if you want an entertaining caraction movie with a few good laughs that is not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind.",

		"I am huge fan And I really enjoyed this flick.  I enjoyed myself here a lot more than I did with other summer blockbusters.It is funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like lame plot and it is much cruder than the show.  Does ANYONE remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode?  Daisy makes incest jokes and Bo says that Luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage.  The only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot.And as far as the plot goes.  It was the perfect Dukes plot.  In fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any TV show that has migrated to the big screen.While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not EXACTLY like their small screen versions, they do a great job and work very well together.  I was not too keen on Burts Boss Hogg though.  And I would have like a little bit more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe.  In the movie Roscoe is a little... scary.And who did not have a smile on their face as the General Lee is racing through the streets of Atlanta and the back roads of Hazzard? Folks, allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you will not be sorry.  It is just a great dumb movie!",

		"I saw this movie when I was a child.  It blew me away.  This was before the days of television, so a movie of this magnitude, could send a young kid into orbit.  It so impressed me, that I went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days.  The special effects used at this time were far ahead of its time.  Sabu was real delight I found myself singing I want to be a sailor for months after the film left town.  I would recommend this movie to any and everyone.  I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was as villainous a character as you would ever want to meet.  Also, June Duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture.  The color was outstanding.  Give this movie an AAA!",
		"Loved the movie.  I even liked most of the actors in it.  But, for me Ms.  Davis very poor attempt at an accent, and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch.  Seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as Ms.  Davis they would be laughed off the screen.I really think she phoned this one in.  Now if it had Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman playing the part of the wife I would have enjoyed it much more.I guess I just do not get Bette Davis.  I have always thought of her as an actor that plays herself no matter what role she is in.  I hope civil detail But, I will continue to watch the movies she is in because I like the storieswritingsupporting casts, but, I will always be thinking, of different actresses that could have done a better job.",

And, of course, June Duprezs sultry looks as the Princess rivals that of Catherine ZetaJones she even looks like Jones in a way!. In conclusion, this is one of my alltime favorite movie next to The Adventures of Robin Hood and it truly deserves more attention.

		"It is fine Rozsa Two roughly contemporary films accomplish thisThief of Baghdad 1940 and The Adventures of Robin Hood 1938.  Some of the back story on this production is fascinating.  This production, commenced in England in the summer of 1939, moved to Hollywood, and proved a cover for British intelligence efforts!  The producer, Alexander Korda, was subsequently knighted in 1942.  Here is a unique case of the intersection of art, commerce, and politics!  By all means, secure a good CD of this film for your library!",
		"us cut long story I loved every minute of it.  A lavish fantasy in true ArabianNights style.  There is an evil magician, a pretty princess, a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after.  Modern Hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic.  Only quibble the special effects are pretty dated loved Sabu with the djinns foot, though!",
		"A magical journey concocted by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell.  These two TITANS of the British cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece!  Some of the most ravishing early Technicolor, a SUBLIME and shimmering Miklos Rozsa musical score along with the youthful exuberance of Sabu, the theatrical and malevolent villainy of Conrad Veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of June Duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well.  Miles Malleson who plays Duprez father, the Sultan of Basra, also wrote the perfect screenplay which is appropriately grandiose.  Do not MISS THIS ONE!  I was amazing classic resolution is amazing classic Again, A MUST SEE!",
		"A fantastic Arabian adventure.  A former king, Ahmad, and his best friend, the thief Abu played by Sabu of Black Narcissus search for Ahmads love interest, who has been stolen by the new king, Jaffar Conrad Veidt.  There is hardly a down moment here.  It is new adventures Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a little boring there is no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is listed fourth in the credits.  Conrad Veidt, always a fun actor, makes a great villain, and Sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves, who at one point finds a genie in a bottle.  I also really loved Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra, the father of the princess.  He collects amazing toys from around the world.  Jaffar bribes him for his daughters hand with a mechanical flying horse.  This probably would count as one of the great childrens films of all time, but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays.  Kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when Abu and the genie are on screen together.  And the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful.  Although most of the younger generation probably thinks that King Kong looks bad at this point in time, Willis OBriens stopmotion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that does not even look remotely like a spider. 810.",

Ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature, and adds an element of danger to the proceedings.  And look out for the moment where he is tricked back into his bottle! John Justin does well as the Arabic king who, for some strange reason, has an English accent and a stiff upper lip.

After they cross paths with the evil Jaffer Conrad Veidt, Justin finds himself blind and Abu is turned into a dog.

In truth, the second half is someway the better, being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature.Three small songs pepper the piece, though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient; I would not classify this as a musical.  It is all great fun; Justin and June Duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads, Veidt is the boohiss villain, and Abu is the youthful, irrepressible robber.  It may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s English movies, but once you have sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in.

It is all great fun; Justin and June Duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads, Veidt is the boohiss villain, and Abu is the youthful, irrepressible robber.  It may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s English movies, but once you have sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in.  Quite commendable.",
		"This was usually producer Alexander Kordas advice on set to many of his underlings; the film is credited with three directors but in truth Alex, Zoltan Korda and William Cameron Menzies helped out, pushing it to six.For John Kobals 1987 book, The Top 100 Movies, his survey of 81 film critics saw The Thief of Bagdad reach 55th place.  A closer examination reveals only Jose Luis Guarner, John Russell Taylor and Kobal himself actually voted for the picture, but their high placings were enough to take it to near the halfway mark.The outbreak of the Second World War saw the movies production shifted around England and America, eventually seeing completion in 1940 and winning three technical Oscars.  Like Citizen Kane, it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love.The special effects, outstanding for the time, are still reasonable, and actually hold up if you squint.  But it is not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions.  Among them is an amusing horse, constructed out of a kit model, which, when a key is inserted up it is rear end, begins to fly.  There is also a killer toy of the sixarmed Goddess Kali, perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her and a quite horrificlooking giant spider.  Also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet.  But most memorable has to be Rex Ingram appearing as, in a superb moment of cinematic conceit, a djinn genie nearly a thousand feet tall!  Ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature, and adds an element of danger to the proceedings.  And look out for the moment where he is tricked back into his bottle! John Justin does well as the Arabic king who, for some strange reason, has an English accent and a stiff upper lip.  Sabu, the astonishingly muscled 15yearold, is nearnamesake Abu, a likeably cocky thief.  After they cross paths with the evil Jaffer Conrad Veidt, Justin finds himself blind and Abu is turned into a dog.  When it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind Ahmeds Justins perspective, we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues.  In truth, the second half is someway the better, being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature.Three small songs pepper the piece, though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient; I would not classify this as a musical.  It is great fun Veidt is boohiss villain Abu is irrepressible robber It is irrepressible robber It may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s English movies, but once you have sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in.

		"The making of The Thief Of Bagdad is quite a story unto itself, almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film.  Alexander Korda nearly went broke making this film.According to the Citadel Film series Book about The Great British Films, adopted son of the United Kingdom Alexander Korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation.  But World War II unfortunately caught up with Korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle.Budget costs happen in US films too, only Cecil B.  DeMille always had a free hand at Paramount after 1932 when he returned there.  But DeMille nor any of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film.  Part of the way through the shoot, Korda transported the whole company to America and shot those sequences with Rex Ingram as the genie in our Grand Canyon.  He certainly was not going to get scenery like that in the UK.  Korda also finished the interiors in Hollywood, all in time for a release on Christmas Day 1940.The spectacle of the thing earned The Thief Of Bagdad four Academy Award nominations and three Oscars for best color cinematography, best artset direction for a color film, and best special effects.  Only Miklos Roszas original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category.  it is bad color The good is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez and the evil is Conrad Veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart, both belonging to Duprez.  This was Veidts career role until Casablanca where he played the Luftwaffe major Stroesser.  Of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source.  Beggar boy and thief Sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star.  Literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the Maharajah of Mysore he was spotted by Alexander Korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features.  Sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the Arabian Nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant.  Not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that.The Thief Of Bagdad holds up remarkably well today.  It is an eternal tale of love, romance, and adventure in any order you want to put it.",

		"This was a favorite of my childhood  I can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time.  Now that I am grown up and have a kid of my own, I wanted to introduce him to this classic movie.  We watched last Friday We watched last Friday During Abus fight with the giant spider, my sons hand crept over and took hold of mine  he was genuinely scared.  Is he gonna beat the spider, Poppa?  Just watch, you will see.  He has no historical frame of reference to speak of eight years old, so Bagdad under the grandson of Haroun alRaschid might as well be Oz under Ozma.I think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derringdo were perpetrated by the boythief, and not the grownup king.  In fact, if you deconstruct the films narrative a bit, the king is the thiefs sidekick, not the hero at all  which must be very satisfying to imaginative, adventurous young boys.  It is definitely a period piece  I suspect that by the time he is eleven or twelve, my son will find it corny or whatever word the next generation will be using by then.  The love story is barely onedimensional  as a cynical friend commented, Why does Ahmad love the Princess?  Because the narrative demands it.  The willingness of Abu to put himself in jeopardy repeatedly for the clueless, lovestruck deposed king is equally improbable.  But to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses, fiftyfoot genies and the Temple of the AllSeeing Eye would be fatuous in the extreme.  The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movies climax is tremendous, as is the final shot of Abu triumphantly flying away on his stolen magic carpet, seeking some fun, and adventure at last!",

		"I have several times She is a much underrated actress and I have to admit I have had a crush on her since I first saw her probably in Wuthering Heights 40 or more years ago.  The real star in this movie, however, is Paul Lukas, and he deserved all the accolades he got.  He makes it clear, whether we like it or not, that the end justifies the means.  Naziism had to be stopped, and anything that helped do it was good.  He gave his children a line about being bad, and that they should not be bad, but as he said earlier when conversing with adults, he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation.  Lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation, and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do.Some people think his victim was a Nazi, but I do not think so  I think he was only after the money.  His Nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him.One interesting point in the film, and presumably also in the play, is the fact that Muller Lucas is a German.  While the anti German hysteria of WWI was not repeated in WWII, there was considerable antiGerman sentiment and some Germans were interred similar to what happened in California with people of Japanese ancestry.  It was something of an act of bravery for Hellman to write a play about good Germans at this time maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the NaziSoviet pact!.  After all, the US and British air forces were bombing German cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians.  I think, however, that the Dresden bombing and firestorm happened later, after Watch on the Rhine was released.The title is something of a play on words, as the watch is looking west, from Germany.  In fact, Watch am Rhein was a German army marching song  used in WWII, but the Nazis had their own marching song that was used as well.  But Muller IS a German and he is engaged in his own Wach am Rhein.All the other actors did an excellent job here; although Bodo was too much there are children like him.

While the anti German hysteria of WWI was not repeated in WWII, there was considerable antiGerman sentiment and some Germans were interred similar to what happened in California with people of Japanese ancestry.  It was something of an act of bravery for Hellman to write a play about good Germans at this time maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the NaziSoviet pact!.  After all, the US and British air forces were bombing German cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians.  I think, however, that the Dresden bombing and firestorm happened later, after Watch on the Rhine was released.The title is something of a play on words, as the watch is looking west, from Germany.  In fact, Watch am Rhein was a German army marching song  used in WWII, but the Nazis had their own marching song that was used as well.  But Muller IS a German and he is engaged in his own Wach am Rhein.All the other actors did an excellent job here; although Bodo was too much there are children like him.  I am surprised he In real life, he may very well have done so.",
		"Probably the finest fantasy film ever made.  Sumptuous colour, spectacular sets, incredible, spoton Miklos Rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood.  Acting is well.Doubtless Spielberg Along with The Four Feathers 1939, one of the two finest motion pictures released by Alexander Korda and London Filmsand one of the finest motion pictures ever made.A true, compelling classic!",

		"I first saw Thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the Jinn I guess.  As any kid would be, I was delighted with the imagination, inventiveness and energy of the film.  I had first viewing I have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years.  In addition to the script, the production transcends the fantasy genre.  This is Korda, the storyteller at his very best.  When you see Thief as a child you know that youve had a great time.  When you see Thief as an adult you know that youve seen a masterpiece.  Its as timeless as the story it treats.  An amazing work.Thomas McCarthy",

		"The storyline of The Thief of Bagdad is complex, owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together.  The screenplay by Lajo Biros and the dialogue by Miles Malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points.The young King Ahmad of Bagdad is angry at his vizier Jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas.  He discovers while in disguise that people blame him for Jaffars deeds and hate him.  he meets young thief He is young thief The two escape and take a boat to the city of Basra.  There the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the Princess of the city passing by.  Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden.  He tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss.  Then he is captured.  When Jaffar comes to win the Princess of Basra for himself, Ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns Abu into a dog.  Jaffar then asks for the Princesss hand, and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the Sultan of Basra.  The blind Ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace, accompanied by Abu as his dog.  The Prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her.  So Jaffar sends his servant Halima for Ahmad and the dog, in hopes the prince can rouse her.  He does awaken her.  She boards a ship to find a doctor to cure Ahmad, but she is captured by Jaffar who then throws the dog overboard.  She then allows Jaffar to take her in his arms, on his promise to restore Ahmads sight and turn Abu back into a thief.  The princess sees a vision of Ahmad; he is in a boat; Jaffar sends a storm to beset him and Abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island.  Abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle.  Abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel, then corks him in again.  For freeing him, he gets three wishes.  His first is for sausages.  In the meanwhile, the Princess pleads with her father to refuse Jaffar; but Jaffar shows the Sultan a new mechanical toy, one of whose six arms stabs him to death.  Abu makes a second wish, to find Ahmad.  The cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the AllSeeing eye.  Abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye, battling a giant spider, then scaling the goddesss statue.  Abu gazes into the eye and sees Ahmad in a canyon.  He has the genie take him to Ahmad.  Ahmad uses the eye to see the princess.  She smells a flower and forgets everything at once.  Abu wishes they were in Bagdad, but the genie laughs and leaves; Jaffar tells the Princess that she is in love with him, omitting mention of Ahmad.  Ahmad tries to fight his way to the Princess, but Jaffar smashes the eye.  Abu finds himself in the Land of Legend, where the old men who rule want to make him their king.  He steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead, to hurry to save Ahmad and the princess.  The thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner, using his bow from the flying carpet, to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution.  Jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse, but another shot from the bow finishes him.  Ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his Princess; but when he tries to make Abu his vizier, the young thief refuses, saying that what he wants is adventure, not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be.  This fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer Alexander Korda.  The production was designed by Vincent Korda who was also art director, while Georges Perinal did the colorful cinematography.  The directors credited are Ludwig Berger and Michael Powell, with Tim Whelan, Alexander Korda, William Cameron Menzies and Zoltan Korda participating.  The extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of John Armstrong, Oliver Messel and Marcel Vertes.  The production, apart from its gorgeous and expensivelooking visual splendors, I claim is dominated by two other elements, the choral music of Miklos Rozsa and the performance by Conrad Veidt as the evil Jaffar.  Rex Ingram plays the genie with a curious accent, plus his usual intelligence and power.  June Duprez is lovely and effective as the Princess Mary Morris is a sad and beautiful Halima, and Miles Malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious Sultan.  As Ahmad, John Justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some; he is memorably good in his winning role.  This film has a spaciousness about it that is found, I assert, in other Korda works also.  Its imaginative content stands in contrast to verystrong realistic sets, costumes and setdesign elements.  This is one of the most memorable idealevel fantasies of all time, worthy to be enjoyed over and over.",

Ahmad tries to fight his way to the Princess, but Jaffar smashes the eye.  Abu finds himself in the Land of Legend, where the old men who rule want to make him their king.  He steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead, to hurry to save Ahmad and the princess.  The thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner, using his bow from the flying carpet, to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution.  Jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse, but another shot from the bow finishes him.  Ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his Princess; but when he tries to make Abu his vizier, the young thief refuses, saying that what he wants is adventure, not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be.  This fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer Alexander Korda.  The production was designed by Vincent Korda who was also art director, while Georges Perinal did the colorful cinematography.  The directors credited are Ludwig Berger and Michael Powell, with Tim Whelan, Alexander Korda, William Cameron Menzies and Zoltan Korda participating.  The extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of John Armstrong, Oliver Messel and Marcel Vertes.  The production, apart from its gorgeous and expensivelooking visual splendors, I claim is dominated by two other elements, the choral music of Miklos Rozsa and the performance by Conrad Veidt as the evil Jaffar.  Rex Ingram plays the genie with a curious accent, plus his usual intelligence and power.  June Duprez is lovely and effective as the Princess Mary Morris is a sad and beautiful Halima, and Miles Malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious Sultan.  As Ahmad, John Justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some; he is memorably good in his winning role.  This film has a spaciousness about it that is found, I assert, in other Korda works also.  Its imaginative content stands in contrast to verystrong realistic sets, costumes and setdesign elements.  This is one of the most memorable idealevel fantasies of all time, worthy to be enjoyed over and over.",
		"The storyline of The Thief of Bagdad is complex, owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together.  The screenplay by Lajo Biros and the dialogue by Miles Malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points.The young King Ahmad of Bagdad is angry at his vizier Jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas.  He discovers while in disguise that people blame him for Jaffars deeds and hate him.  He is imprisoned by Jaffar, where he meets Abu the young thief.  The two escape and take a boat to the city of Basra.  There the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the Princess of the city passing by.  Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden.  He tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss.  Then he is captured.  When Jaffar comes to win the Princess of Basra for himself, Ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns Abu into a dog.  Jaffar then asks for the Princesss hand, and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the Sultan of Basra.  The blind Ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace, accompanied by Abu as his dog.  The Prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her.  So Jaffar sends his servant Halima for Ahmad and the dog, in hopes the prince can rouse her.  He does awaken her.  She boards a ship to find a doctor to cure Ahmad, but she is captured by Jaffar who then throws the dog overboard.

		"I was little kid The sets are breath taking and some of the script is damn right hilarious You sons of a thousand fleas.It is always shown on TV late at night or really early in the morning i woke up at about 300 am once and it had just started.  TV companys need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time Sunday so everyone can get a chance to view this fine work.1010",
		"The movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful, but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of Baghdad. the jailed prince meets a thief called Abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called Basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with, but unbeknown to him the evil wizard Jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her.  Jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns Abu into a dog.  This leads to the prince and Abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat Jafa, restore peace to Baghdad and marry the princess. during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic Genies that takes Abu on a flight through the clouds, a giant spider that is really hungry, and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen.This is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses, genies, flying carpets, and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs.  It does cheesy moments It does cheesy moments The production designs are just stunning in this movie.  From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter.  Even though this movie is over 40 years old, the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in todays cinema.  The music and songs are also well done.  Anyone who sees it will no doubt hail, I want to be a sailor sailing on the seas as one of the great musical moments in movies.  I am usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since I find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but I will be more than happy to make an exception for this movie.What sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you do not see in everyday life which is also the same reason why I love stuff like Two Towers and Silent Hill.  Way before todays modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic CGI to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place.  One of my favorite shots in Two Towers is the one where we see the trolls opening the Black Gates, the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor, and that is what I love about the Genie and other creatures in the movie.  They are just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they are all just fantasy beings.It is literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of Aladdin got their inspiration.  The characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative Genie right down to the flying carpet.  It is not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it is nice to know that I am not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie.  I first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week I still think it is amazing.  That is a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time.  Sure, the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40s so give it a break.  Not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under todays standard.If you ever wanted to see a live action version of Aladdin then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this will not be their cup of tea.",
		"The movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful, but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of Baghdad. the jailed prince meets a thief called Abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called Basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with, but unbeknown to him the evil wizard Jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her.  Jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns Abu into a dog.  This leads to the prince and Abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat Jafa, restore peace to Baghdad and marry the princess. during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic Genies that takes Abu on a flight through the clouds, a giant spider that is really hungry, and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen.This is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses, genies, flying carpets, and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs.  It does not have any cheesy moments and the love story is not a waste of time.  The production designs are just stunning in this movie.

		"Outstanding film of 1943 with Paul Lukas giving an Oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to America from Europe as the Nazi menace deepened.The usual terrific Bette Davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of 1943.Encounting treachery around them, Lukas successfully deals with the situation.  He knows clandestine mission Resolute, she knows that her older son, must follow him on his path to liberty.A wonderful film highlighting American positive propaganda against a wicked foe.",
		"The Thief of Baghdad is one of my ten alltime favorite movies.  It is exciting without gore, it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless.  The casting could not have been better.  Rex Ingram made me believe in genies.  And the epitome of evil is certainly captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar.  He set the bar very high...I watch this movie at least twice a year...and never tire of it.  This film is an adventure for all ages..noone too old to enjoy it.  I was first time Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying evilness a few years later in Casablanca.  And Korda teamed up,I believe, with Justin and Dupree again in The Four Feathers....great filmmaking!",

		"An utterly beautiful film, one of a handful of I saw when young that entranced me then and still do, in Thiefs case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time.  it came local arthouse we came again.Idealistic Prince it had again.Idealistic Prince After escaping with a little thief played by Sabu, Ahmad spots a Princess and they fall blindingly in love  along the way they have many adventures although apparently not enough for Sabu!  and Love not only conquers but annihilates everything.  The special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940, but Time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like Superman from 40 years later.  Anyway, if I am requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies, flying horses and carpets I also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects!  Favourite bits the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when Ahmad reveals himself and Adelaide Halls suitably romantic song; the stunning colours in the tent in the Land Of Legend  in fact, the stunning colours throughout; Sabu and Rozsas triumphant but still wistful finale.  Conrad Veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever, this and Casablanca, and then died.  John Justin and June Duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers, both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted, but the parts did not call for a huge range of emotions only pure love mattered.There is a couple of mildly violent images in it, but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100 positive message, it is only a pity that nowadays little kids do not watch this instead of the porn they prefer.  One of my Top 10 film favourites, I cannot recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of Time.",

		"I first discovered Alexander Kordas 1940 Fantasy, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD in the early 1950s on a reissue billed as The Wonder Show of the Century!  Both Korda Technicolor films, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK were shown on one never to be forgotten program.  The music of Miklos Rozsa enhanced both films.  The Technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful!  THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made.  As the years passed, it became more difficult to enjoy the films color in the way it had originally been presented in.  True Technicolor gave way to a Eastman Color process in the middle 1950s.  Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video.  But the Eastman Color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original Technicolor.  The Laser Disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it  nice, but not as it should be.  NOW comes the MGM DVD 3 Dec 2002 issue.  THE THIEF OF BAGDAD again has the wonderful Technicolor look to it on a DVD that is nothing short of STUNNING!!!  It was second time The only Extras are a Spanish Dubbed version, SubTitles in both English  Spanish, and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer.  Thank you MGM for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD release.  Now, one can only hope that Kordas FOUR FEATHERS and a restored version of Kordas JUNGLE BOOK to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation will soon follow on DVD.",

		"it opens blind man us feel blind man It must be admitted that the second half does not quite live up to the promise of the first.  Like the Arabian Nights it tries to cram as many MiddleEastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work.  A freed genie, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea voyages, a crowded marketplace, a wicked vizier, jewels ...  I do not know why it all works, but it does.  Everything is just so beautiful.  The sets are beautiful.  June Duprez is beautiful.  Rozsas score is especially beautiful.  As usual, it sounds Hungarian; but somehow he manages to convince us that he is being Hungarian in a Persian way.",
		"Like the Arabian Nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that there is plot, plot and more plot it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life, then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind mans present, where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come.

		"The Thief of Bagdad is impressive in the shape of the evil magician Jaffar Conrad Veidt.  he ignored literary terms The costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds, attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror...The radiant hero wears white turbans and robes, and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues...For spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before, while through its use of color, it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before...With flying carpet and flying white horse, with a giant genie excellently played by Rex Ingram, with evil wizards, and with the good acting of Sabu and Veidt, The Thief of Bagdad captures the quality and true atmosphere of the Arabian Nights...  The 1940 version remains the screens finest fairy tale!",
		"The story of the boy thief of Bagdad as it was once spelled has attracted filmmakers from Raoul Walsh in 1924, who starred Douglas Fairbanks in the first, silent, rendering of Thief of Bagdad, to less imposing, more recent attempts.  The best, however, remains 1940s version which for its time was a startling, magical panoply of top quality special effects.  Those effects still work their charm.No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred Sabu as the boy thief, Abu, John Justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch, Ahmad and June Duprez as the lovely princess sought by Ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier, Jaffar, played by a sinister Conrad Veidt.  The giant genie is ably acted by Rex Ingram.Ahmad is treacherously deposed by Jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent, he and the boy, Abu, suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates.  Abu becomes lovable mutt Ahmad is lovable mutt Their adventures through the gaily decorated Hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work.Two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornadolike black swirl Lawrence W.  Butler and Tom Howard.  Howard, incidentally, did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film.  Both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry.Duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting.  Justins Ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses.  Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he is very good.  For a movie meant for kids as well as adults there is a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind.  Still, I do not think anyone under eight ought to see Thief of Bagdad.This film makes periodic appearances on TV but today my teenage son and I saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present.  It was great to see computerbesotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them.Thief of Bagdad is a prewar Hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases.  This is one of the best of its kind.910.",

Probably if the Tony Awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well.  The Oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy, and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie.  Every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was.  Lukass nomination is usually the kind the Academy gives to round out a field.Jack Warner knew that which is why Mady Christians did not repeat her Broadway part and the role of Lukass wife was given to Bette Davis.  Davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her, but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it.  It is the same reason she did The Man Who Came To Dinner, a much lighter play than this one.Davis is the daughter of a late American Supreme Court Justice who married a German national back in the Weimar days.  After many years of being vagabonds on the continent of Europe, Davis Lukas, and their three children come to America which has not yet entered the European War.  They are made welcome by Lucile Watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren.The fly in this ointment are some other house guests, a friend of Daviss from bygone days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe, a Rumanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris.  Coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects Lukass antifascist background.  His suspicions are quite correct, it is the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they have become.  Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there.  His health has not been the same since.  His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes.  Those decisions affect all the other members of the cast.Adding quite a bit more to the Broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was Dashiell Hammett who was Lillian Hellmans significant other.  Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy was a Hammett creation with such loathsome types as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders.Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account Runmanian count.  He was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the Nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after Stalingrad.Lucile Watson was up for Best Supporting Actress in 1943, but lost to Katina Paxinou in For Whom The Bell Tolls.

		"This is a most handsome film.  it shows brilliant color Other indoor scenes at various mansions, etc are equally brilliant.  As for the music, what more can be said other than that Lanzas voice was at its peak as he sang so many of the worlds best known and beloved arias.  The marvelous Dorothy Kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of Lanza in delightful harmony.  Of course, Hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of Caruso.  There is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events.  For example, the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth.  There are some very good web sites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain several pictures of him.  These web sites can be located by using any good search engine.  There are also several books available concerning his life history.  But, the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film.  The voices of Lanza, Kirsten, and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie.  Enjoy, I know that I sure did.",
		"Mario Lanza, of course, is The Great Caruso in this 1951 film also starring Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath.  This is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary, worldrenowned tenor whose name is known even today.The film is opulently produced, and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by Lanza, Kirsten, Judmila Novotna, Blanche Thebom, and other opera stars who appeared in the film.  If you are a purist, seeing people on stage smiling during the Sextet from Lucia will strike you as odd  even if Caruso as wife Dorothy just had a baby girl.  Also it is highly unlikely that Caruso ever sang Edgardo in Lucia; the role lay too high for him.In taking dramatic license, the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of Caruso as life.  him is standard repertoire These roles include Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in Girl of the Golden West, There is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga.  The reason for that photo?  His only shirt was in the laundry.  He was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the Victor TalkingMachine Company later RCA Victor.  He was singing Jose in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquake.Instead, the MGM story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of Martha, which never happened.  He had a hemorrhage during LElisir damore at the Met and could not finish the performance; he only sang three more times at the Met, his last role as Eleazar in La Juive.  What killed him?  The same thing that killed Valentino  peritonitis.  His first role at the Met was not Radames in Aida, as indicated in the film, but the Duke in Rigoletto.  So when it says on the screen suggested by Dorothy Caruso as biography of her husband, that is what it was  suggested.  What is true is that Dorothys father disowned her after her marriage, and left her 1 of his massive estate.  They also did have a daughter Gloria together who died at the age of 79 on 1072007.  However, Caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married Dorothy.Some people say that Lanzas voice is remarkably like Caruso as, but just listen to Caruso sing in the film Match Point  Caruso as voice is remarkably unlike Lanzas.  In fact, from his sound, had he wanted to, Caruso could have sung as a baritone.  He is thought to have had some trouble with high notes, further evidence of baritone leanings; and the role he was preparing when he died was Othello, a dramatic tenor role, which Lanza definitely was not.  Lanzas voice deserved not to be compared with another.  He made a unique contribution to film history, popularizing operatic music.  He sings the music in The Great Caruso with a robust energy; he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career.  His acting is natural and genuine.  Ann Blyth is lovely as Dorothy and gets to sing a little herself.Really a film for opera lovers and Lanza fans, which are probably one and the same.",

This is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary, worldrenowned tenor whose name is known even today.The film is opulently produced, and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by Lanza, Kirsten, Judmila Novotna, Blanche Thebom, and other opera stars who appeared in the film.  If you are a purist, seeing people on stage smiling during the Sextet from Lucia will strike you as odd  even if Caruso as wife Dorothy just had a baby girl.  Also it is highly unlikely that Caruso ever sang Edgardo in Lucia; the role lay too high for him.In taking dramatic license, the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of Caruso as life.  What was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire, yet this is never mentioned in the film.  These roles include Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in Girl of the Golden West, There is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga.  The reason for that photo?  His only shirt was in the laundry.  He was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the Victor TalkingMachine Company later RCA Victor.  He was singing Jose in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquake.Instead, the MGM story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of Martha, which never happened.  He had a hemorrhage during LElisir damore at the Met and could not finish the performance; he only sang three more times at the Met, his last role as Eleazar in La Juive.  What killed him?  The same thing that killed Valentino  peritonitis.  His first role at the Met was not Radames in Aida, as indicated in the film, but the Duke in Rigoletto.  So when it says on the screen suggested by Dorothy Caruso as biography of her husband, that is what it was  suggested.  What is true is that Dorothys father disowned her after her marriage, and left her 1 of his massive estate.  They also did have a daughter Gloria together who died at the age of 79 on 1072007.  However, Caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married Dorothy.Some people say that Lanzas voice is remarkably like Caruso as, but just listen to Caruso sing in the film Match Point  Caruso as voice is remarkably unlike Lanzas.  In fact, from his sound, had he wanted to, Caruso could have sung as a baritone.  He is thought to have had some trouble with high notes, further evidence of baritone leanings; and the role he was preparing when he died was Othello, a dramatic tenor role, which Lanza definitely was not.  Lanzas voice deserved not to be compared with another.  He made a unique contribution to film history, popularizing operatic music.  He sings robust energy he is short career He sings short career His acting is natural and genuine.  Ann Blyth is lovely as Dorothy and gets to sing a little herself.Really a film for opera lovers and Lanza fans, which are probably one and the same.",
		"Yes, Be My Love was Mario Lanzas skyrocket to fame and still is popular today.  MGM decided Great Caruso Lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of Caruso.  Having read the book by Kostelanitz who wrote a biography of Lanza, he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary Caruso to Lanza.  There is no doubt that Lanza did a superb job in the story, but the story is not entirely true; blame it on Hollywood!  I used to practise singing his songs years ago, and became pretty good myself until I lost my voice because of emphysemaasthma ten years ago.

		"Since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio, I doubt we will ever get a real life story of Enrico Caruso.  But if everything else was in place it was no accident that no Hollywood studio attempted the task until MetroGoldwynMayer had Mario Lanza under contract.  No one else could have done it, I doubt whether it will ever be tried again.And why should it.  I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen.  For his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on the earth.  To say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest.  Caruso, like the man who portrayed him, was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline.  He had numerous relationships His contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought.  He is shown in a recording studio once late in his life.  Actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor made the recording industry what it became.When Caruso and McCormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live.  But a lot of immigrant Italian and Irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men.  It is why both became the legends that they are.What the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by Mario Lanza, a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a Caruso to stick to opera.  The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design.Mario himself helped popularize the film with an RCA Red Seal album of songs from The Great Caruso.  Unfortunately due to contractual obligations we could not get an actual cast album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, and Jarmila Novotna also.Though Blyth sang it in the film, Lanza had a big hit recording of The Loveliest Night of the Year further helping to popularize The Great Caruso.If you are looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, this as not it.  If you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career, than you should not miss The Great Caruso.",

		"I like personal experience Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite.  The characters in the firm did not really enjoy their real lives, but they did enjoy themselves, i.e. what they were.  The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory.  A good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life.  Many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those.  Before Sunrise dealt with it in a nice way, which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film.  Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head.  It just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities.  This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas.  You would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story.  The end was not quite important after all.  You could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie.  Movies are supposed to be enjoyable.  This is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it.  I am on a journey too.  The movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions.",

During the next several hours the two wander Vienna taking in all that the city has to offer and become madly infatuated with each other.  But will this newfound relationship last past sunrise.This wonderful romanticcomedy is a breath of fresh air to a genre that has been in decline.

The chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they are a couple.  The movies grabs you right away and does not let go.  You cannot look away nor can you stop listening to them.  Even the little moments just melt your heart.

		"An American woman, her European husband and children return to her mothers home in Watch on the Rhine, a 1943 film based on the play by Lillian Hellman, and starring Paul Lukas whom I believe is repeating his stage role here, Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald, and Donald Woods.  An antiFascist, a worker in the underground movement, many times injured, and wanted by the Nazis, Kurt Muller Lukas is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy motherinlaw.  Coulouris is liberal point It was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released, as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe American homes.  The movies big controversy today is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar over Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca.  Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous Rick, but Lukas is transcendent as Kurt.  The monologue he has about the need to kill is gutwrenching, just to mention one scene.Though this is not what one thinks of as a Bette Davis movie, she gives a masterful performance here as Kurts loyal and loving wife, Sara.  Her acting tugs at the heart, and the love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and tender.The last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions.  Lillian Hellman is not everyones cup of tea, but unlike The Little Foxes, she has written some truly sympathetic, wonderful characters and a fine story given A casting and production values by Warner Brothers.  Highly recommended.",

		"I bought first time Having saw it twice, I could not help but missing Before Sunrise, not because the sequel was not as great, but I felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did, every time I finished watching one of them, I feel the need and yearning to see the other.  So, I ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly, I will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly.  The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other.  It sounds so simple, the growing of the chemistry, I think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development, but to me  who does not believe in Nora Ephron  Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it.  When I saw it for the first time, about 8 year ago when I was 20, I already liked it.  But, I did not rate it as a great film, it still seemed to me like another thinking persons feel good movie, Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic, it was 10 minutes too long, the characters was too well fabricated, I thought I liked it because it was like a dream and because I enjoyed their conversations, etc. etc..  But now, thanks to Before Sunset, I feel that is more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before.  I saw the elements more clearly Jesse, Celine, Vienna, their conversations, everything.  How each of them are separated element by itself, and they have a chance to mix, the story is just a frame of time, I am no longer feel manipulated.  And the freedom that every scene has, as well as its refusal to be overly efficient, how blind I was that those qualities did not strike me as exceptional when I first saw it!  Now, 8 year have passed, the more movies I have seen, the more I realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending, even movies like Pulp Fiction or Linklaterss own Slackers included.  The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that, maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case, but Before Sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time, not a destination, every single scene has its own life.  I do not know whether Linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made Before Sunrise, but to me, one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other.  Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes, seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine, the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it.  Meanwhile, I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset, and Celines first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile I have seen in a beginning of a film, and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place I do not know with a sadness in me, no matter how beautiful Paris is, and no matter how happy I am that they meet again.  I am sorry that I go on this long with my limited English, Before Sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts, and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it.",

Still, I watched it!  And I was amazed...Before Sunrise is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way, wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth, we are sentenced to death, or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity, or that, we, humans, can afford sometimes to live in fairytales.  The ending was wonderfully chosen we do not know if they will meet again in six months, at six of the clock, in Viennas station in our optimism, we sincerely hope so.

		"me compliment basic treatment As a lot has been written about the movie already, it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved.I think the point where Jesse and Celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending 24 hrs... the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with...On the plot front , making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish..I believe in romantic flicks of such flavor , the characters are not clearly designed even in the writers and directors mind.  What the actors bring out is what becomes of them .. right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify... to become the character, the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story...here both the actors do just the RIGHT job!  Kudos..!!! and Before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful!",
		"I managed last night After sleeping it over, I have to say that I largely prefer the former over the latter, and I shall explain why.Before Sunrise introduces us with then young actors, Ethan Hawke Reality Bites, Dead Poets Society, only 25 at the time of the films release; and Julie Delpy the Three Colors trilogy, then 26 although looking much younger.  He is a promiscuous American writer, touring Europe after breaking up with his girlfriend; She is a young French student, on her way home to Paris.  They meet on the BudapestVienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together.  The two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of Vienna, exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love.The film has 1990s written all over it back then, technology was leaping rapidly, the new millennium with all it is hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner, and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future.  The characters of Jesse Hawke and Celine Delpy, with all their flaws and inconsistencies Celines accent, if by mistake or on purpose, was half Americanhalf French, and it swinged from one spectrum to the other, breaking the characters credibility, were a mirror of the time.  Watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement, acting all clich?d and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well, is what really made this movie work for me.  The fact that the director does not let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while.All in all, Sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of Vienna, a well told classical romantic rendezvous, and a film I will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future.",

If you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about loveydovey romance, do not waste your time and money.  On the other hand, if you are into dialog, masterful story telling, thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie.  you are overall tone you watch overall tone I recommend overall tone It is truly fantastic.  I really mean that.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but, thankfully, the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural, warm and tender.  They act and feel each other out from the very beginning, making you feel as an intruder.In their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner.  I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but I may be underestimating their intelligence.  Still it did not ruin the movie.The overall story is very simple which I think gives the movie it is charm and ultimately it is power.BOTTOM LINE The movies flow is slow.  The dialog is fascinating.  The story builds gently, systematically and substantive.  The build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding.",

		"After a chance encounter on the train, a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of Vienna, discussing life and love.  The primary reason to see Before Sunrise, is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines.  As Celine, this sexy, brainy, soulful browneyed blond is sort of a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Joni Mitchell as they were in their midtwenties.  Risking overstatement, Celine is practically the ideal woman, unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural, unpretentious, introspective, and selflessly loving.  We can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak, for her sincere, intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating.  she speaks French accent If there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie, it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar.  Ethan Hawke as Jessie comes off like a vaguely appealing slob, sort of a Maynard G.  Krebs of the nineties.  Attempting to appear detached and nonchalant, he sort of drags himself through certain shots.  His pants fit poorly, his tee shirt is coming untucked, his wavy dark hair his most attractive feature needs a good washing, and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee.  Nevertheless, he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a twoweek train ride around Europe, so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine.  His oftcynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic Celine, although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation.  When he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence, we know he is getting somewhere.  After blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes, bars, and silly diversions, they agree that because they may never see one another again, they should make the most of it.

		"it came advanced screening I saw advanced screening I was sorry when I talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended.  I, on the other hand, felt completely the opposite.  I was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else.  People I talked to said there was too much talking!  Plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters.  I found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the American moviegoing public seems to have a tendency to want easytofollow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused.  They also like to be spoonfed tidy endingshappy OR sad.  This disgusts me.  Nobody wants to be challenged anymore???  And as for the ending and I do not want to be a spoiler, I am totally content because I know in my heart that these two characters WILL see each other again.  It is all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny.  It is a very personal film that does not speak to all people.  But it certainly spoke to me.  Give it a chance!  Be patient with it!  Richard Linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of Vienna.  Watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters.  As if you yourself were tripping through Europe on a Eurail pass.  It is very intimate.  Plus, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life.  They must have improvised during some parts and it works well.  They have a great chemistry in their roles.  Their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses.  I get the feeling that this was a very personal work for Mr.  Linklater and I deeply respect him for getting this film made.  It definitely touched me and I hope it touches others just as much.

The children...did not act like children in the slightest.  But there is good reason for that, having had to hid and run most of your life, seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence.  So people saying oooo i hated how the kids acted...blah blah blah read between the lines and know they saw things children should not see.Paul Lukas...dear Paul did an amazing job!!!  Now I know many people are mad that he go the Oscar and Bogie did not but hey they both did amazing jobs so I think it could have gone either way.  But Lukas performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie I was reduced to tears.  I loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone!!  D",

		"This movie is intelligent.  That is, more than most other movies, it transcends the least common denominator  stupid people will probably not appreciate it.  The story also relies heavily on dialogue.  It has surreal atmosphere The actors play absolutely brilliantly.  Rarely have I seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together.The dialogue moves into very personal issues, with the risk of becoming a little over the top.  It does, however, stay on the right side almost all the time, although I found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing.  Balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors.  Sometimes, it yields great results, and overall this movie is simply stupendous!  Only very, very rarely is love in films depicted in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic.  Every time that is achieved, the result is fantastic.  I think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect.  She still looks stunning in this film, 12 years after.This is simply a gem of a movie that you cannot miss.  One of the best movies I have seen from the 1990s!",

		"Sunrise has remarkable things it is observant character it is human connection it is human connection How does one fall in love at first sight?  No one does, at least that is deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film.  And yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time.  Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie, a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna, and on the way there start to talking about things, at first arbitrary, then personal Jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather.  Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the town, in Vienna, until his plane the next morning.Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine, in the midst of the gorgeous Vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance, and in a sense is about the act of having conversations, of what it is like to watch people having one leading into another and another.  Here it is often about relationships and commitments, as Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential, or seemingly so, and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities.  We hear confessions of desires for other loves, or what were not really loves, of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you will love your life, of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form, or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul I loved the bit about the quakers in the church, and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism.  Jessie may be more responsible for that last part, but what is fascinating about the film is that it is never exactly cynical itself, just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives.Meanwhile, it is always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in these roles, where they are not incessantly annoying in that 90s GenerationX mode, but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film, which is not a bad one at all but a necessary one, one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere.  The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter, only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other, where sweet asides are actually acceptable I have to tell you a secret, Jessie says, and then leans in for a kiss, hoho, or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way.  I loved the scene with the poet, where it is very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal, or with the palm reader and how the reactions from Jessie and Celine are that we might share, but really are seeing them do it firsthand.  All the while Hawke and Delpy embody the roles interestingly we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives as it may lead off into the future...Featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness, however selfcontained, as it may lead into something more.  Who is to say you cannot suddenly be attached to someone, if only for less than 24 hours, and be that much more attached than a married couple?  This is perhaps Linklaters thesis, but there is more to it than just that.  It is a very dense film, and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly.  One scene especially, which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking on the phone in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the others friend.  A",
		"Before Sunrise has many remarkable things going on, almost too many to fit into one review like this, but it is suffice to say that it is one of the most observant character studies of the nineties, maybe even in all of contemporary cinema, to be observant not about love, persay, so much as it is about a human connection.  How does one fall in love at first sight?  No one does, at least that is deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film.  And yet there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time.

		"This is truly truly one of the best movies about love that I have ever seen.  it is same romance.This OK, that is only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie.  Reading the other reviews, it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialogbased movies as well.  And this is what makes Before Sunrise so good.  The dialog is perfect.  It is so real, so engaging and funny.  It is hardly a surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love, coz you fall in love with them at the very same time.My favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop, where they pretend to phone their best friends, with the other pretending to be said best friend.  It is PERFECT.  Brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life.I must say that if you have a choice, do watch Before Sunrise before watching Before Sunset.  If like me, you watched Sunset first, it is hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show.Once again, the greatest romantic movie in my books.  Wonderful acting, excellent script, and beautiful locations.  Young love, at it is best.",

		"Sweet and charming, funny and poignant, plot less but meaningful, Before Sunrise 1995, the third movie of Richard Linklater, is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love, is in love, or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it.  It is rare movies It seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car chases, or long and steamy sex scenes.  Two young people in their early 20s, two college students American tourist Ethan Hawke who is returning home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend the classes in Sorbonne meet on a train.  They are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking, they hop off the train in Vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night.  They talk and fall in love.  That is it, that is the movie.  It could have been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing at least, for this viewer.  High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is.  Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticellis angel, is great in portraying smart, independent, and incredibly attractive young woman.",

		"First let me say that Before Sunrise, like all movies, is NOT a movie for all tastes.  it is harmless movie It appears harmless movie For me, like most folks here, Before Sunrise struck a deep chord in me, I was truly stunned, moved, inspired by it.  This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing.  It creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine.  It is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings I got from it.The movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other.  It is very intelligent and inspiring, not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of Jesse and Celines discussions, but rather the little nuances, the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other.  It captures an honest, romantic, yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime Viennese milieu; it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world.  And what happens after that night is open for debate, but I never doubt that they will not each other again.The facile comments by RockytheBear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie.See it and it may change your way of life.",

It appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact, but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people.  For me, like most folks here, Before Sunrise struck a deep chord in me, I was truly stunned, moved, inspired by it.  This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing.  It creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine.

		"There are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime, but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives.  These once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we do not meet these people anymore.  We do not always even know their names, as we are never presented to each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are.  we like fond memories It is common humanity It is common humanity We are too afraid to check that out.The movie Before Sunrise just caught me watching it.  I never had intention to watch it through, but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting, I gave a look for the rest of the film.  I did not know what to expect from it, but nor did the young couple.  They had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate.  I believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through.  It makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives.",

		"I heard last night I had interested me It sparked my interest, but I never expected it to be this great.  Before Sunrise is a masterpiece, and it is also one of the most romantic films on record.  To my surprise, it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s.  It is impossible to really talk too much about it, since there is no real plot, so to speak although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about; it is sort of like My Dinner With Andre, where there is a conversation, but it is not JUST the conversation that matters, but let me just say, see it.  SEE IT!",

		"Many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with The Mortal Storm or Casablanca.  Casablanca is unjust treatment Everyone is unjust treatment It does not strike me as totally wrong.  Lukas had a good career in film both here and in England  he is the villain in The Lady Vanishes, and this performance was his best one.  Bogart had more great performances in him than Rick Blaine for instance, he was ignored for Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Roy Earle in High Sierra two years earlier, both of which were first rate performances, and he would not get an Oscar for his greatest performances as Fred C.  Dobbs in The Treasure Of Sierra Madres, the writermurder suspect in In A Lonely Place, and Captain Philip Francis Queeg in The Caine Mutiny afterward  he got it for Charley in The African Queen.  I think that Bogie should have got it for the role of Dobbs, but it did not happen.  But Lukas was lucky  he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career.  Few can claim that.To me the film to look at with Watch On The Rhine is based on another playscript by Hellman, The Searching Wind.  They both look at Americas spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s.  The Searching Wind is really looking at the whole interwar period, while Watch On The Rhine, set in the years just proceeding our entry into World War II, deals with a few weeks of time.  Therefore it is better constructed as a play, and more meaningful for it is impact.  The film has many good performances, led by Lukas as the exhausted but determined antiNazi fightercourier, Davis as his loyal wife wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to Lukas being the center of the plays activities, Coulouris as the selfish, conniving, but ultimately foolish and ineffective Teck, Lucille Watson as the mother of Davis and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Coulouris wiser and sadder and fed up wife, and Kurt Katch, who delivers a devastating critique as the local embassys Gestapo chief about Coulouris and others who would deal with the Nazis.  It has dialog with bite in it.  And what it says is quite true.  It also has moments of near poetry.  Witness the scene, towards the end, when Coulouris is left alone with Lukas and Davis, and says, The New World has left the scene to the Old World.  Hellman could write very well at times.Given the strength of the film script and performances I would rate this film highly among World War II films.",
		"Many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with The Mortal Storm or Casablanca.  Everyone is entitled to compare films they choose, but the similarities of The Mortal Storm and Watch On The Rhine are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the Nazi juggernaut, while the main comparative point brought out with Casablanca is the seeming unjust treatment of Humphrey Bogart in 1943 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science, because they chose Paul Lukas instead for the Best Actor Oscar.
